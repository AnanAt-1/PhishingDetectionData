EDITORIAL. 


We have very great pleasure in adding the name of Mr. 
Craupge Mortey to the list of specialists who are good enough to 
advise and assist us in their particular departments of Entomo- 
logy. Mr. Morley, who is the author of ‘The Ichneumons of 
Great Britain,’ and of other works on Hymenoptera, has already 
contributed various instructive and helpful papers to our pages, 
and it is hoped that his closer connection with the magazine 
may be followed by the appearance of many other articles from 
his pen. 


ZENILLIA (MYXEXORISTA) ROSEAN4, B. &amp; B., 
A NEW BRITISH . DIPTERON. 


By James EK. Coun, F.E.S. 


In November last I received from Mr. R. Adkin several 
specimens of the dipteron to which he refers in the subjoined 
note as having been reared from pupe of Tortrix pronubana, Hb. 
They were submitted to Mr. C. J. Wainwright, who has made a 
special study of the Tachinid group to which they clearly belonged, 
and he is of opinion that they are undoubtedly referable to 
Zenillia roseane, B. &amp; B., a species not hitherto recognised as 
British and which may be known by the following characters :— 

A small to moderate sized species of the usual Tachinid appear- 
ance, black with greyish reflections. Face and orbits whitish. Eyes 
sparsely hairy. Frons only slightly produced, at the vertex about one 
quarter the width of the head (female), slightly less in the male; two 
pairs of orbital bristles in the female, none in the male ; frontal bristles 
in a single row extending scarcely beyond the level of the insertion of 
the arista, outside this row for its entire length there are a number of 
fine hairg scattered in the male, but less numerous and almost in a 
single row inthe female. Ocellar bristles developed, pointing forwards. 
Mouth margin not produced, one strong pair of vibrisse placed just 
above the mouth opening, the smaller oral bristles continued in a row 


ENTOM.—JANUARY, 1909. B

quite halfway up the face. Cheeks bare, jowls narrow, about one 
sixth the height of eye. Palpi stout and black. Antenne very long, 
third joint quite four times the length of second, arista bare, distinctly 
thickened to about the middle, second joint not much lengthened. 
Scutellum blackish grey, terminal bristles crossed and not erect, 
though slightly upturned. Abdomen ovate, with discal and marginal 
macrochete. Hind tibie with unequal bristles, ungues microscopi- 
cally pubescent, nearly as long as last tarsal joint (male), much shorter 
(female). Wings with first posterior cell open, ending just before 
wing tip, angle of cubital vein slightly rounded and without an 
appendix, radial vein bristly at base only. Length 4-6 mm. 

Zenillia (Myxexorista) roseane was described by Brauer &amp; 
Bergenstamm in Denkschr. Akad. Wien lviii. (1891) p. 8382. It 
was known to them in the female sex only, the specimens having 
been bred from Tortriz roseana, Hw., and no one appears to have 
recognised the species since. 

Mr. Adkin has also reared another parasitic dipteron from 
Tortriz pronubana which appeared with the above ; this second 
species is Nemorilla maculosa, Mg., which is reported as having 
been bred on the Continent from Acrobasis consociella, Hb., 
Cacecia murinana, Hb., Psecadia bipunctella, F., Rhodophea 
suavella, Zk., Sylepta ruralis, Scop., and Pyralis sp. 

Newmarket: December, 1908. 


The first traces of the parasite referred to above were seen 
in June last, when, in the cage in which I was keeping the pupe 
of Tortrix pronubana, I found several dipterons not unlike small 
houseflies in general appearance. Upon closer investigation I 
found among the leaves in which the Y’ortrix had pupated the 
puparia from which the dipterons had emerged. In the autumn 
[ again collected wild larve of 7’. pronubana, which in due course 
pupated, and the dipterons again began to appear. I therefore 
made a careful examination of the pupal webs, and in many 
cases found a dipterous puparium in the web alongside the 
lepidopterous pupa; in every case the pupa had been fully 
formed before the parasitic larva emerged from it. The number 
of pupe infested I should estimate at fully twenty per cent. 
Tortrix roseana, the species from which Bergenstamm reared 
the original specimens of Zenillia roseane, occurs in the same 
gardens where 7’. pronubana is found, and is also pretty generally 
distributed throughout the surrounding country; it is therefore 
quite likely that the dipteron may ali along have infested that © 
species, but been overlooked, and that having found a more 
suitable host in the double-brooded J’. pronubana, has been able 
to multiply more rapidly, and even become a serious menace to 
its existence; yet it should be noted that larve of Tortrix podana 
and Batodes angustiorana, taken in some numbers at the same 


time and place as the spring larve of J’. pronubana, showed no 
signs of the parasite.-—Roperr ADKIN. 


THE GENERIC NAME ACIDALIA. 
By Louis B. Prout, F.E.S. 


Now that we have the excellent ‘“‘ International Code’ of 
nomenclature to guide us, together with the supplementary re- 
port which appeared in the American ‘Science’ for Oct. 15th, 1907 
(pp. 520-523), there is some hope of definite progress towards a 
correct application of generic names, and I trust we can give a 
decent burial alike to the Scudderian phantom of “ restriction ” 
of one name by another, and the fetich of “‘page-priority.” In my 
own work under this code I have found exceedingly few cases of 
perplexity, and most of those long academic discussions which 
have delighted some of us will no more be necessary. Of 
Treitschke’s genera, mostly founded in 1825 on “ bibliographic 
references”’ to Schiffermiuller, and therefore prior to those of 
Hubner’s ‘ Verzeichniss’ (apparently not published till 1826), 
nearly all had types selected for them by Duponchel in 1829, and 
only three or four of his selections were really unhappy on 
diagnostic grounds. At the moment I am only concerned with 
Acidalia. 

Assuming that the date 1826 will be definitely accepted for 
Hiibner’s ‘ Verzeichniss,’ the name Acidalia really belongs to the 
Geometride. In my ‘‘Notes on the Wave Moths” (Entom. 
Xxxvili. 6) I pointed out that the only logical type for Acidalia 
according to the diagnosis was brumata, Linn., and I strongly 
adhere to that as my own personal opinion. But Duponchel in 
1829 selected strigaria, Hb.; Curtis in 1881 aversata; and 
Stephens in 1835 (Ill. Haust. iv. 393) ochrata. By the strict 
rule Duponchel’s selection must stand unless (1) the genus 
already possessed a type ‘‘ on the basis of the original publi- 
cation’; or (2) strigaria was “‘not included under the generic 
name at the time of its original publication,” or was a species 
inquirenda from Treitschke’s standpoint, or was doubtfully 
referred by him to Acidalia (vide ‘ Science,’ 1907, p. 521). The 
first was certainly not the case; of the contingencies under 
(2), only the question of the species inquirenda could apply, 
for Treitschke did include strigaria in 1825, and not with a 
query. I believe, however, that he was fairly well acquainted 
with the species. 

If, then, Duponchel’s action can be set aside, it can only be 
on the ground of the nature of the “indication” of the genus. 
Acidalia, ‘., was, at its original publication in 1825, mainly a 
name for an unnamed genus of Schiffermuller’s (1775), and 
Schiffermuller did not include strigaria therein (if, as I believe, 
strig ria, Hb., Tr. = virgulata, Schiff., the last-named placed it 
in a different genus). 

But it is, I suppose, better that a few generic names should 

B2 


4 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


be illogically applied than that complicating exceptions should 
be allowed into a simple system; and in any case ochrata, Scop. 
(Stephens’ choice—Curtis’ is ultra vires, for aversata was placed 
in Idea, Tr.), which would have to be accepted under the Code, 
would no better fulfil the evident original intention of Schiffer- 
muller and Treitschke than does strigaria. Therefore, I accept 
strigaria, Hub., as the type of Acidalia, Tr., Dup. restr. Perhaps 
it is a just retribution on Treitschke for creating such a ‘‘ mixed 
genus,” and it saves the name of Operophtera, Hub., for brumata. 

I showed in ‘The Entomologist’ for 1906 (xxxix. 266) 
that on every conceivable ground then known to me ornata, 
Scop., was the type of Schrank’s genus Scopula; and as I believe 
no one had ever previously “‘ selected a type” from Schrank’s 
two species, I claim that this action can stand, in spite of the 
indifference of the Code to generic diagnosis. The genus, if we 
give it Hampson’s scope, will be Scopula = Acidalia = Arrhostia 
= Leptomeris = Craspedia = Emmiltis = Dosithea; but as it is 
possible to make a separate genus, on wing form, for the ornata 
sroup, I would suggest that believers in small genera subdivide 
thus :— 

A. Scopula, Schrank = Craspedia, Hb. = Dosithea, Dup. (type, 
ornata, Scop.). Hind wing with margin more or less scolloped, 
especially between vein 4 and 6. 

B. Acidalia, Tr. = Arrhostia (Hb.), H.-S. = Leptomeris (Hb.), 
Meyr. = Emmiltis (Hb.) Warr., (type, virgulata, Schiff. = strigaria, 
Hb.). Hind wing with margin not scolloped. 

Sterrha, Hb., and Ptychopoda, Stph., abide unmoved amidst 
all these changes.

THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITAA. 


By Grorcre WuHeeter, M.A., F.E.S. 
(Continued from vol. xli. p. 307.) 


BeroreE entering upon the general question of variation, and 
especially upon the original descriptions of the named varieties, 
there is one of the latter which seems to me to merit special 
attention on the ground that it is almost certainly a distinct 
species, viz. the Bukowina form generally known as aurelia var. 
dictynnotdes, Horm. This form is described very completely and 
at great length in ‘Iris,’ x., pp. 2 et seq. (1898). Finding that no 
specimen at my disposal really corresponded with this description, 
particularly in the matter of the remarkably elongated wings, on 
which great stress is laid in the description, I wrote to Herr von 
Hormuzaki, who courteously replied, sending me a pair taken on 
Mt. Cecina, near Czernowitz, the same locality from which the 


THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELIT@MA. 5 


originally described specimens came. These are of course 
absolutely authentic, and I exhibited them the day after their 
arrival (i.e. Nov. 18th) at the meeting of the Ent. Soc. of London, 
and also on the 26th at the South London Meeting. They may 
be most readily described as the converse of britomartis, having 
the upper side of dictynna, but the under side, as Hormuzaki says, 
generally nearest to parthenie, but often to athalia and sometimes 
even to deione, ‘‘ but never,’ as he remarks, ‘‘like aurelia,” and, 
one may add, still less like dictynna. Hormuzaki’s account is too 
long for transcription, and also unfortunately treats the dark 
part as the ground-colour (excusably enough in the Bukowina 
Meliteas of this group), so that the simplest plan would seem to 
be to describe it from his specimens in terms of the general 
description of the group (vol. xli., pp. 200, 201, 221), noting 
those respects in which he mentions this form as being variable. 


Up. s. f. w.: Lunules replaced by small quadrangular or irregularly 
triangular spots in the male, occasionally regularly triangular in the 
female, the lowest always absent and the third always somewhat the 
largest. Subterminal and elbowed lines thick, leaving small, more 
or less quadrangular spots of the ground colour; inner subterminal 
almost as much bent as in athalia, marginal blotch very large but 
sometimes containing a patch of the ground colour, especially in the 
female. Stigma oval, containing traces of the ground colour, or only 
thickly outlined; basal lines thick, or, in the male, included in the 
basal suffusion which almost reaches the marginal blotch. 

Up.s. h. w.: Outer line coalescing with border, so as to form a broad 
marginal band, rarely showing traces of a row of spots of the ground 
colour in the male, oftener in the female, where they are sometimes 
fairly distinct, round, triangular, or even lunular, whitish in some 
females and in one male, especially near the costa; inner line included 
in the large basal suffusion, which in some males extends over the 
whole wing, as in dictynna ab. seminigra (Musch.), though oceasion- 
ally it only reaches to the extra line, giving another line of spots of 
the ground colour, or sometimes of a ‘lighter shade, some of which 
are in rare cases lengthened out towards the base. 

Un. s. f. w.: Inner line of border bearing (in both my specimens) 
small dark triangles as in dezone ; lunules light, especially towards the 
costa, and two or three light spots between the subterminal lines, the 
outer of which is distinct, the inner traceable, throughout; elbowed 
line represented by a row of spots, most conspicuous, as is the inner 
subterminal, near the costa; marginal blotch very small, the other 
dark markings clear but fine. 

Un. s. h. w.: Inner edge of border slightly angulated, both parts 
of terminal band nearly (or quite) unicolorous, which is also the case 
in my specimens with the central band; outer band interrupted near 
costa, the lunules almost reaching the central band, and being utterly 
destitute of the black points of dictynna and britomartis ; central band 
very broad, the third and fourth spots not projecting far beyond the 
others; inner band rather narrow, with small light spot, basal band 
also narrow, with very small central spot and the fifth spot absent. 


6 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Antenne as in athalia, but with even less white edging at the joints 
above; beneath, the white sometimes runs into the side of the tip. 


As the palpi appear to vary it will be best to give Hormuzaki’s 
own description. He says that they are black from above, with 
occasionally a few red-brown hairs, never with whitish or greyish- 
yellow hairs, though he has two specimens whose palpi, seen 
from above, are reddish. The outer side is occasionally red- 
brown throughout, the terminal joint being generally of this 
colour, or reddish-yellow, but occasionally black, the middle and 
lower joints are, however, generally black towards the base, 
rarely sprinkled with yellow, but the yellow becomes much more 
noticeable on the middle joint, and towards the terminal joint 
merges into red-brown. The hair forms a reddish-yellow or 
black brush towards the end of the middlejoint. The inner side 
of the lower and middle joints is bright yellow but towards the 
terminal joint generally reddish, though sometimes blackish or 
red-brown. 

Much stress is laid by Hormuzaki on the elongated shape of 
the wings and a number of measurements given to show how con- 
stant is this peculiarity in comparison with athalia; this is 
certainly very noticeable in the case of a pair of Bukowina athalia 
kindly sent to me by him with the dictynnoides, but I possess 
athalia from the Rhone Valley and the lower Vaudois Alps with 
wings quite as elongated, especially in the female. The Bukowina 
examples have a remarkably square and ‘‘ cobby’”’ appearance, 
even more so than the mountain specimens from Switzerland. 
I think that if I were exclusively a “‘ study-lepidopterist ’’ without 
any “‘ field’ experience (such people really do still exist, and even 
propound theories in more than one HKuropean language), I 
should be inclined on the mere face of things to regard dictynnoides 
as a very dark form of athalia, but the field knowledge which 
Hormuzaki brings to bear on the subject puts this theory out of* 
the question ; for he telis us that these are the only two Meliteas 
of this group that are common in Bukowina and the neighbouring 
districts ; that dictynnoides, the commoner of the two, is found 
in some places where athalia is not; that in others athalia only 
is found; but that in many places both occur together. More- 
over, dictynnoides flies from the beginning of June, or sometimes 
the end of May, and never later than mid-July, whereas athalia 
appears about June 80th and continues till near the end of July. 
With aurelia, with which itis generally placed, it has nothing 
whatever in common, and even if it had, the case of those who 
hold this theory would be put out of court by the fact that typical 
aurelia, differing very little from the Valais form, is also taken 
at Czernowitz, where it comes out from three weeks to a month 
later than dictynnotdes ; it is, however, scarce, and this is its only 
known locality in Bukowina. The upper side is certainly near 
dictynna, but the under side separates it entirely from that species ; 


~

it is still further from varia, further still (in spite of some resem- 
blance on the under side) from deione and parthenie, is the very 
converse of britomartis, and has not even a superficial resem- 
blance to any form of asteria. The earlier stages, when they 
become known—which there is reason to hope may be during 
next season—may give cause for the reconsideration of any 
opinion now expressed, but so far as our present knowledge 
extends, I feel no doubt that we should regard it as a distinct 
species. The question of its phylogeny is most interestingly 
dis:ussed in the same paper, and to this reference will have to 
be made again. 


THE DRAGONFLIES OF EPPING FOREST IN 1908. 
By F. W. &amp; H. Campion. 


THE season began with a backward spring, but at least the 
usual number of dragonflies appeared with the beautiful weather 
which came in June. By the end of August dragonflies had 
become decidedly scarce, although a few of the common kinds 
survived to enjoy the warm summer-like days of early October. 

Unusually late dates were recorded for Libellula depressa and 
Afschna grandis. 

Erythromma naias was added to the list of Odonata collected by 
ourselvesin Epping Forest. That list now consists of twenty-one 
species, or exactly one half the total for the British Islands. 

An account of the captures made during the year is given 
below, the species being named in the order in which they came 
under our observation. 

(1) Pyrrhosoma nymphula was, as is usual in our district, the 
dragonfly earliest on the wing, and a single immature female was 
obtained on May 10th. On May 31st a male was discovered 
to have the right hind wing in a very rudimentary state. It is 
a remarkable fact that we have in our collection quite a number 
of dragonflies, belonging to various species, having the same 
wing in a more or less undeveloped condition. P. nymphula was 
not noticed after July 12th 

(2) Cordulia enea occurred very early in the season, a some- 
what immature male being taken on May 17th. A week later 
(May 24th) we obtained two newly-emerged females, from which 
we learned that at that stage of development the abdomen is 
emphatically purple, although the front of the thorax is already 
green. The eyes were opaque brown, and the band between 
segments two and three, instead of being yellow, was dirty white. 
The wings were brownish, and the basal saffron was pale and 
indistinct. The accessory membranes were satin-white, and the 
pterostigmata grey. On June 7th two more females were taken, 
both fine adult specimens. One of them had the wings very

dark and the saffron strongly marked. On this occasion we 
were able to confirm what we had observed in a previous year, 
that the eyes of the female are wholly green, little if at all 
inferior, in richness of colour, to the splendid eyes of the male. 
De Selys is quoted in Mr. Lucas’s book as stating that in the 
female there is a “‘ chestnut tint to upper surface of eyes,” but, 
so far as the adult insect is concerned, this statement is not in 
accord with the observations here recorded. A female was 
observed to be ovipositing on June 21st. By July 12th, when 
the last specimen was obtained, the species had become very 
scarce, and it was noticed that the eyes of the male then taken 
were losing the translucent green observed so recently as a week 
before, and were acquiring a tinge of chestnut. 

(3) Agrion puella.—The first specimens were taken on May 
dist and the last on August 16th. On June 28th a male was 
obtained while feeding upon a small moth, which had already 
lost its head and its left hind wing. The prey was identified as 
Tortriz viridana, and the identification was kindly confirmed by 
Mr. R. South. The form of the female having cuneiform blue 
spots on segments three to six occurred on June 21st and July 
5th and 12th. 

(4) Ischnura elegans, first taken on May 31st, continued to be 
met with until August 30th. The form of the female known as 
rufescens was taken on July 12th and 26th, and the form named 
mfuscans on June 14th and 21st, July 5th and 25th, and August 
30th. 

(5) Hnallagma cyathigerum was found in flight from May 31st 
to Sept. 12th. On June 8th a male was taken with the anterior 
portion of the spot on segment two entirely disconnected from 
the circlet behind; the spot closely resembled the exceptional 
marking numbered 1 on plate xxvii. of ‘British Dragonflies.’ 
A female of the type (blue) form was collected on July 12th. 

(6) Libellula depressa was first seen on the wing on May 3lst, 
but no specimens were taken before June 28th. The latest 
capture was that of a single male on September 7th, an extremely 
late date for the species. Notwithstanding the fact that this 
year’s specimens (four males) were obtained from widely separ- 
ated parts of the Forest, they all differ in a marked degree from 
those taken in other seasons in having the abdomen narrow and 
strongly triquetrous, instead of broad and flattened. 

(7) Hrythromma naias was met with by us for the first time 
in Epping Forest on June 14th, when it was in fine condition and 
fairly well distributed along the margins of one of the Forest 
ponds. It was seen again on several occasions, at that and 
other ponds, but specimens were then difficult to get, owing 
to their usually flying well away from the banks, and resting 
upon the floating leaves of Potamogeton. In such circumstances 
they were very liable to be mistaken for I. elegans or overlooked 


‘DRAGONFLIES OF EPPING FOREST IN 1908. 9 


altogether, and herein may lie the explanation of their having 
escaped our notice in previous years, although in 1900 Mr. F. 
Enock bred the species from nymphs taken at Loughton (Entom. 
1901, p. 68). No captures were made after June 28th, but the 
species probably lasted for some time longer. 

(8) L. quadrimaculata was not uncommon in the central parts 
of the Forest, where captures were made on June 28th. 

(9) Anaz imperator was first met with on June 28th, when 
two males were taken, one of them with wings in poor condition. 
We think it incorrect to describe the eyes of this species as blue, 
and that a truer description would be:—Hyes opaque green, 
lightly shot with translucent blue on their upper surface. On 
the same occasion a male, not taken, was observed to dash 
through a swarm of 7'ortrix viridana, which were flying about an 
oak-tree, and was seen to seize and fly off with one of the moths. 
A specimen was noticed as late as August 2nd. 

(10) A’schna cyanea, usually such a common insect, was 
decidedly scarce. A newly-emerged male was taken, with its 
discarded nymph-skin, on July 5th, and provided us with a date 
for the species earlier by sixteen days than our previous earliest 
date. No specimen with the mature coloration was obtained 
before August 16th (a male), but we continued to meet with the 
insect until October 18th, when another male was taken. 

(11) 42. grandis was first seen in flight on July 25th, and a 
very immature female was taken on August 2nd, although the 
species, in fully adult condition, was already common. OnAug. 9th, 
by which time this insect had become extraordinarily abundant 
everywhere in the Forest, a female taken while ovipositing had 
seoment six and the following segments of the abdomen wet from 
immersion in the water. Another female, similarly engaged, 
was netted on September 6th, and had more than half the seg- 
ments (Nos. 5-10) in a wet state. On September 27th we watched 
for a considerable time a specimen of 44. grandis huwking over a 
pond, and saw it take several insects in succession, some of 
which it deliberately discarded after examination: this observa- 
tion was interesting as showing that all is not prey that comes 
to a dragonfly’s jaws. A female was obtained as late as October 
11th, and the species was again seen even a week after that. 

(12) Sympetrum striolatum.—Immature females made their 
appearance on July 25th, but no males could be found before 
August 9th. The species was never really common, and the last 
capture was effected on October 18th. 

(13) S. sanguineum.— The only examples secured were a 
freshly-emerged female (July 26th) and an adult male (Sept. 12th). 
The first was obviously a native of the pond at which it occurred. 
In the matter of coloration, the chief points which distinguished 
this specimen from adult females appeared to be these :—Saffron 
at base of wings inconspicuous; pterostigmata greenish grey ;

dorsal aspect of thorax and abdomen brownish yellow; abdomen 
without white powder on ventral surface. 

(14) Lestes sponsa was plentiful in one locality on August 10th; 
a few of the males were immature, and deficient in blue powder 
on those parts which take on a pruinose condition in later life. 
The species was again met with, at another locality, on August 
16th. 

Among dragonflies seen but not taken may be mentioned a 
single Calopteryx (June 14th), and an Aischnid with which we 
got to very close quarters on September 10th ; judged by its size 
and manner of flight, if must have been 47. miata.

LIST OF PAPERS OF THE LATE MARTIN JACOBY. 
By GEorGE JACOBSON. 


Aux the numerous entomological publications (one hundredand 
forty-one in number) of the late Martin Jacoby (who died Dec. 
24th, 1907) are devoted to one family of beetles only, to the Chry- 
somelide or Phytophagous beetles. The author has described 238 
genera, 5094 species, and 7 varieties in this family. According 
to this enormous number of described species, which embraces 
one-fourth of all the known species of the family, we must range 
M. Jacoby in the first place among workers in the field of 
descriptive morphology of Chrysomelide.* 

Jacoby’s influence as authority within the narrow limits of 
this family is particularly great, because he concentrated his 
attention on the study of the Chrysomelide exclusively, and 
never went beyond it. Even in the family he seems to have 
ignored two large subfamilies: Cassidini and Hispini. More- 
over, of Palwarctic forms he described only one species from the 
Island of Crete, and a few species from Japan and North China. 
The great majority of his papers are purely descriptive, except 
Nos. 68, 88, 90, 123, 124, and 127 (concerning external morpho- 
logy of separate groups and genera), Nos. 11 and 140 (repre- 
senting two faunistic revisions with some descriptive material), 
and Nos. 106, 116, 117, 180, 181, and 186 (of general systematic 
interest).

Coleoptera. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1876, pp. 807-817. [1 new 
genus, 21 new species, 1 new variety. ] 


** We possess no data concerning the numbers of species described within 
limits of this family by other specialists, but there is no doubt that no other 
coleopterist (even Baly in England) has described so many forms as the late 
Martin Jacoby.

FROM BORNEO. 


By P. Cameron. 


Nomada malayana, sp. nov. 

Black; the thorax red, the second abdominal segment with a 
somewhat pyriform transverse white mark, broad and rounded on the 
inner side, gradually narrowed from the inner to the outer side; there 
is a broad transverse line on the fifth and sixth segments; base of

antennal scape, the terminal antennal joint, the anterior tarsi, and 
the apex of clypeus, rufous; mandibles of a paler rufous colour, their 
base tinged with yellow. Wings hyaline, their apex with a narrow 
cloud; the stigma dark fuscous, the nervures black. @. Length, 
5-6 mm. 


Kuching, Borneo (John Hewitt, B.A.). 


Face, front, pleurz, and lower half of the sides of metanotum 
broadly covered with white pubescence. Head and thorax closely, 
distinctly punctured, the former more strongly than the latter. 
Metanotal area clearly defined, broadly roundly narrowed behind, 
closely reticulated, its centre black. Legs covered thickly with white 
pubescence; the calcaria white. The first transverse cubital nervure 
is sharply, obliquely sloped from below the middle in front; the 
shorter posterior part is less steeply, obliquely sloped; the second is 
broadly roundly curved outwardly; the first recurrent nervure is 
received near the base of the apical fourth of the cellule. Abdomen 
very smooth and shining, the apical margins of the segments not 
depressed. The clypeus is more strongly punctured than the 
front, its apex is a little raised; narrowly rufous, there being also 
a wider rufous line down the centre. There is no keel between the 
antenne. 


A distinct species. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


MECONEMA VARIUM; A CorrecTion.—In the ‘ Entomologist’ for 
November, 1880, p. 252, the little leaf-cricket bred from the galls 
made on the oaks by Cynips kollari, and which Mr. Bignell saw 
emerge in the month of May, were, as is evident from the spotted 
legs of the one that has served for illustration, the young of Odon- 
tura punctatissima, said to frequent oak-trees, and not those of the 
verdant Meconema vartwm found on limes and on rose-bushes. This 
mistake has taken its origin from a remark made by Leopold Fischer in 
his ‘Orthoptera Europa,’ p. 241. I have found both these little 
creatures in the garden here in Devonshire at the close of the year.— 
A. H. Swinton; Totnes. 

[Whether the Orthoptera bred from galls of Cynips kollari were 
Meconema variwm or Leptophyes punctatissima, they were in either 
case Locustid grasshoppers and not crickets. As regards the full- 
grown grasshoppers, L. punctatissima is spotted, or rather irrorated, 
while M. variwm is not. But these specimens were so young that 
unless both species had been bred from the egg and we could make a 
comparison, if would scarcely be safe to say that Fitch (who wrote 
the article) is wrong. Possibly, too, Bignell may have bred them 
through. Meconema variwm is very common on oaks in the New 
Forest ; it would fare badly there for lime-trees. L. punctatissima is 
generally found on low-growing plants. Still the spotted appearance 
of the insect figured leads one to suspect L. punctatissima.—W. J. L.]

GENITALIA OF THE British Nocruinm. — We have received 
intimation that Mr. F. N. Pierce, F.E.S., is about to publish a work 
under the above title. As practically the genitalia of all the British 
species of Noctuide have been examined by Mr. Pierce, and as 
drawings of these will be given, the work should be indispensable to 
entomologists. The cost of production will be considerable no doubt, 
and the author, who proposes to issue the book at the low figure of 
five shillings, will be glad to secure as large a number of subscribers 
as possible. His address is The Elms, Dingle, Liverpool. 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


Mamestra (HADENA) GLAUCA AND ACRONYCTA MENYANTHIDES IN 
GriamorGAN.— While looking for Macrothylacia rubt on May 22nd, 
1907, on the hills between Merthyr and Aberdare, I came upon two 
fine specimens of M. (H.) glauca sitting on a clump of heather. 
Further searching on subsequent occasions produced a few more 
specimens resting on an old wall which runs across the hill. In 
May of this year several specimens of the insect were again taken in 
the same place, and while searching for it on June 6th in another 
locality on the same hill I found both it and several fine specimens of 
A. menyanthides sitting on heaps of stones which are scattered over 
the mountain side. Other specimens of the latter species were 
observed at intervals up to June 20th. J am not aware that either 
of these species has been taken previously in this district.—G. 
FLeminG ; 9, Fairview Terrace, Merthyr Tydfil. 


LARV# OF CIRRH@DIA XERAMPELINA HATCHING IN DECEMBER. 
—From some ova of C. xerampelina, which I had kept outdoors 
under usual conditions, larve hatched out on the 13th inst. Is not 
this unusual, seeing that the ash-buds at present are very small and 
apparently too hard for such young larvee to penetrate? On 10th 
inst. I took (here) a larva of Lasiocampa quercus; it was unusually 
active, and crawling across a sunny doorstep.—HrErRBERT W. BAKER; 
73, Limetree Place, Stowmarket, Suffolk, December 12th, 1908. 


PIERIS BRASSICH IN DECEMBER.—On December 16th I found a 
number of larvee of P. brassice feeding on cabbage in my garden here. 
—W. Jarvis; 22, Leicester Road, Lewes, Sussex. 


[Our correspondent kindly sent half a dozen of these larve, one or 
two of which were then nearly full grown, and have since pupated. 
It will be remembered that Mr. Frohawk (Entom. xli. 39) recorded 
three larvee of P. brassic@ at Rayleigh, Essex, on January 4th, 1908. ] 


PIERIS RAPZ IN DECEMBER.—I have an evidently fresh specimen 
of P. rape, which was captured on December 10th of this year. 
This seems to be a most extraordinary time of year for this butterfly 
to be on the wing, and I can only account for it by the fact that we 
have had such a phenomenally mild autumn, though I have not 
heard of other examples having been seen. I may add the butterfly 


is still alive (December 15th, 1908).— Gruorrrey MraprE-WaALpo; 
Hever Warren, Hever, Kent.

Shanghai: Mr. E. M. Eustace, of Challacombe Rectory, Parracombe, 
R.S.0., North Devon; Captain F. H. Hardy, R.A.M.C., Medical 
Officer of the British Central Africa Protectorate; Mr. Jens M. A. 
Knudsen, of Noerre Nebel, Denmark; Captain Leonard Paul, of 
Brook House, Eastry, S.0., Kent; and Mr. B. C. S. Warren, of The 
Avenue, Amersham, Bucks, were elected Fellows of the Society.— 
Mr. E. C. Bedwell exhibited examples of the rare weevil Procas 
armillatus, taken in Sherwood Forest in 1908; and specimens of 
Phyllobius argentatus and P. maculicornis with deciduous mandibles 
attached.—Mr. P. de la Garde sent for exhibition specimens of the 
following new and rare Coleoptera :—Laccobius purpurascens, New- 
bery, recently described as new to science; Ceuthorrhynchus parvu- 
lus; and Phyllotreta diademata, recent additions to the British list ; 
Arena octavii, Sibinia sodalis, Neuraphes longicollis, Cardiophorus 
equisiti, rare and local species; and a species of Choleva, right-hand 
maxillary palpus in triplicate-——Mr. W. S. Sheldon exhibited a speci- 
men of Anthrocera achillee, from Oban, one of those taken by Mr. 
Renton and recently recorded as British, with forms of the species 
from the South of France; and of A. filipendule and A. exulans 
from Scotland, for comparison——Mr. R. M. Prideaux, a gynandro- 
morphous specimen of Lycena zephyrus var. lycidas from the Simp- 
lon, taken in July last; an example of Chrysophanus alevphron var. 
gordius ab. female midas, Lowe, from below Salvan in the Rhone 
Valley; and a striking aberration of Melitea didyma with the spots 
of the lower wings coalescent in thick splashes, captured near Bérisal 
in July, 1905.—Mr. A. Harrison, the resulting series obtained by cross 
pairings of successive broods of Pieris napi var. bryonie. He said 
that as a demonstration of Mendelian proportions they were quite 
negative. So far it would appear that the bryonie characters were 
not transmitted by the male, but in an exaggerated degree by the 
female.—Mr. L. W. Newman read a note on the life-history, and ex- 
hibited examples, of the imago of Polygonia c-album. He said that 
his observations led him to conclude that the first twelve to twenty 
ova laid by the hybernated females are the only ova which produce 
the var. hutchinsoni, and that this variety is the only form which 
pairs and produces the second brood.—Dr. Karl Jordan exhibited 
examples of Charaxes zoolina, and its nearest allies C. betsimiseraka 
and betanimena from Madagascar, zoolina and neanthes from East 
Africa, phanara and ekinket from West Africa, and kahldent and home- 
yert from West Africa. This exhibit confirmed the result of Mr. G. F. 
Leigh’s breeding experiment mentioned by Professor EK. B. Poulton 
at the last meeting.—Dr. F. A. Dixey, specimens of the genera 
Colaenis, Heliconius and Pereute, to illustrate a mimetic relation 
between C. telesiphe, Hew., H. telesiphe, Doubl., and P. antodyca, 
Boisd.—The Rey. G. Wheeler, a pair of Melitea dictynna var. dictyn- 
-noides Horm., received from Herr Hormuzaki. They are the con- 
verse of M. britomartis, having the upper side of dictynna but the 
under much nearer to parthenie. This form is usually described as a

var. of aurelia, Nick., but as almost typical awrelia, a specimen of 
which was exhibited, are found at the same place, Mt. Cecina, near 
Czernowitz, Bukowina, this seems unlikely—Mr. Edward Meyrick 
B.A., F.R.S., communicated a paper entitled ‘ Descriptions of Micro- 
Lepidoptera from Bolivia and Peru.” 

December 2nd, 1908.—Mr.C.O. Waterhouse, President, in the chair. 
—Mr. Sydney Douglas Crompton, of Carlton House, Kew Gardens, 
S.W., and Mr. W. Parkinson Curtis, of Aysgarth, Poole, Dorset, were 
elected Fellows of the Society.—Mr. H. W. Andrews exhibited some 
examples of predaceous Diptera and their victims, taken during the 
year ; and a specimen of Bassus letatorius, Fab., female, bred from a 
pupa of the dipteron Syrphus balteatus, Dej.— Professor T. Hudson 
Beare and Mr. H. St. John Donisthorpe brought for exhibition speci- 
mens of Olophrum assimile, Payk., a beetle new to the British fauna, 
taken by them in September, 1908, at Nethy Bridge. Mr. Donis- 
thorpe also showed examples of Trechus longicornis, Stm., from Kelton, 
near Dumfries; and of an Anaspis, either referable to septentricnalis, 
Champion, or new to the British list, taken in woody fungus at Nethy 
Bridge, this being probably the third specimen discovered.—Mr. G. C. 
Champion expressed his opinion that the Anaspis in question did not 
belong to the species described by himself or by Schilsky, but was 4. 
melanostoma, an identification rejected by the exhibitor on account of 
the male characters.—Mr. G. T. Porritt exhibited forms of Abraxas 
grossulariata bred from wild Huddersfield larvee during the past year, 
with two males of the var. varleyata, showing how wide a range of varia- 
tion there is, even in the variety.—Mr. L. W. Newman also exhibited 
an extreme form of varleyata, the whole of the fore wings being coal- 
black, and only a very narrow white band on hind wings.—Mr. W. J. 
Kaye exhibited a fine series of Heliconius species from Mapiri River, 
North Bolivia, to show the close parallel variation between the very 
variable forms of melponene with the equally variable forms of phyllis. 
Mr. kh. J. Beck brought for exhibition variant forms of Adalia bipunc- 
tata L., from Alton and Farnham; examples of Lzrus paraplecticus 
taken on Siwm angustifolium, resembling small pieces of driftwood; and 
a specimen of Leptwra sanguinolenta, taken at Southampton, by sweep- 
ing Umbellifere.— Mr. W. Schmassman showed a case containing 
specimens of Pyrameis atalanta, which had been subjected in the pupal 
stage to various degrees of temperature.—Mr. I’, Merrifield exhibited, 
on behalf of Mr. Reuss, of Ware, Herts, a remarkable aberration of 
Aglais urtice, bred in October, 1906, from wild autumn larve, the 
pupa being exposed to the direct rays of the sun; and interesting as 
showing the transition of one form of Vanessa markings to the other. 
—Dr. F. A. Dixey, specimens of South American and African butter- 
flies, remarking that since the last meeting Mr. W. I. H. Rosenberg 
had kindly furnished him with fresh evidence tending to show that 
Colaenis telesiphe, though cryptically coloured beneath, was at least 
as common as Heliconius telesiphe, and was therefore not likely to be 
a Batesian mimic of that species. He added that Belenois thysa, 
which had often been: spoken of as a Batesian mimic of Mylothris 
agathina, had been found by Mr. H. W. Simmonds to be much 
commoner at Berea, Durban, than its model. This confirmed an 
observation made by Dr. Longstaff and the speaker at Congella, near 
Durban, in 1905.—H. Rownanp-Brown, M.A., Hon. Secretary.

series of Coremia ferrugata, bred from ova; the larve were fed on 
common Galiwm, and would not touch ground ivy.—Mr. H. Moore, 
specimens of the tsetse-fly (Glossinia palpalis ?) from near Lake 
Chad, one of the mediums of the terrible “‘ sleeping sickness.” —Mr.

argtolus, bred on October 18th from a September larva.—Mr. Smith, 
a bred melanic example of Cleora glabraria from the New Forest.— 
Mr. H. J. Turner, a considerable number of species of Lepidoptera 
taken in Switzerland (Zermatt, Vissoye, Binn, and Saas Fée) by Dr. 
Chapman, including a small race of Hrebia ceto, H. mnestra, H. gorge, 
E. lappona, Gineis aéllo, very silvery Argynnis niobe, a three-spotted 
female of Epinephele lycaon, and a curious aberration of Brenthis

rape bred from Redhill larve, the pupxw having been subjected to 
alternate spells of high and low temperatures; the imagines showed 
an intensification of the yellow coloration on the under sides, thus 
resembling Scotch specimens.—Mr. L. W. Newman, a long series of 
hybrids from Smerinthus ocellatus male and S. populi female, the 
percentage of females being very small. Rev. C. R. N. Burrows

in character, the members showing results of the season’s work.— 


22, THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Mr. Robert Tait, Jv., brought a long series of Agrotis agathina bred 
from Welsh larve, and noted that the red form occurred much more 
frequently among wild imagines than among moths bred at Man- 
chester from larve taken on the same ground earlier in the year. 
From the Isle of Wight, fine species of the following :—Agrotis 
lunigera, A. cinerea, Acidalia humiliata, Setina trrorella. From 
Pendine, South Wales:—Boarmia repandata var. conversaria, Calli- 
morpha dominula. From Lakeside :—Numeria pulveraria, Tephrosia 
consonaria, and a very long series of S biundularia, varying from 
almost white to the extreme form of var. delamerensis. Mr. Tait 
stated that he had bred a partial second brood of the following 
species, viz.:—B. repandata var. conversaria, Aplecta herbida, and 
A. humiliata, a living example of which he exhibited at the meeting. 
—Mr. Mounfield, of Warrington, showed a fine series of Lthosia 
sericea, and Leucania pallens, a red variety from Warrington; Ma- 
caria liturata var. nigrofulvata, a short series from Delamere Forest. 
—Mr. Robinson, of Warrington, also exhibited LD. sericea, as well as 
Hydrecia petasitis, H. lucens, H. metitans, H. paludis, Hadena 
glauca, Orthosia suspecta, Agrotis nigricans, and Acronycta leporina 
var. melanocephala, all from Warrington and neighbourhood; while 
from Delamere Forest he showed Aplecta nebulosa var. robsont and 
Lithosia mesomella.—Mr. T. Baxter, of St. Anne’s, sent a long series 
of Abraxas grossulariata and varieties, from St. Anne’s, and short 
series of Polia chi vars., including olzvacea and melanic forms from 
Yorkshire; also strongly marked typical specimens of this variable 
moth from Barmouth.—Dr. Edwards had series of Abraxas sylvata 
and Noctua glareosa, from Carnaryon; Hupithecia pulchellata from 
the Lake District; Dasychira fascelina, from Formby; Celena 
haworthii and Luperina cespitis, from Delamere Forest.—Mr. Prince 
sent several boxes of local insects, including a very long series of 
Nyssia zonaria.—Myr. H. R. Sweeting exhibited Aplecta nebulosa and 
var. robsont, and Boarnua repandata, from Delamere ; Cucullia asteris, 
from Essex; Moma orion, bred from New Forest pupze which had 
laid over two winters.—Mr. W. J. Lucas, of Kingston-on-Thames, 
sent a number of excellent photographs of Lepidoptera.—Dr. Bell 
had several varieties of Bombyx quercus from Wallasey, including the 
olive variety; Dr. Bell stated that the larvee from which the olive 
forms were bred were black with very dark brown hairs; this had 
also been noted by other collectors, and was supported by a further 
exhibit, by the same member, of young larve from olive parents, and 
from typical parents in which this difference was well seen.—Mr. 
Mallinson brought a specimen of Dezlephila galit, bred from one of 
the two larve found at Wallasey, September, 1907.—Mr. W. Mans- 
bridge exhibited a series of Aplecta nebulosa var. robsoni, very dark 
grey forms, and var. pallida, bred 1908; Polia chi var. olivacea, from 
near Leeds; and stated that this form had increased from about five 
per cent. noted in 1890-1, to about twenty per cent. noted this year. 
A series of black Boarnwa repandata, from Knowsley, Lancashire, and 
a male Porthesia similis, from Simonswood, without the black spots 
on the hind margin of the fore wings; a short series of Peronea per- 
mutana, from Wallasey.—H. R. Sweeting &amp; Wm. MAnspripGe,

24 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


In part ii. (April, 1908) the principal entomological contribution 
is that by M. Mackenzie and H. Maxwell-Lefroy, entitled “The Sugar- 
cane Borers of Behar.” These borers are the larve of moths that 
attack the sugar-cane. Two species, Scirpophaga awriflua and S. 
monostigma, injure the shoots. Four others—Chilo simplex, C. awri- 
cilia, Nonagria wniformis, and Anerastria abutella—are described as 
‘‘side-borers.”” The larva of Polyocha saccharella destroys the roots, 
and seems to be capable of causing more permanent mischief than 
either of the other “borers.” All the moths, together with ova, larve, 
and pupe, are well figured in colour on plate xx., and the methods of 
larval attack are shown on plates xxi. and xxii.

THE GENUS NYCTERIDOPSYLLA,* OvuprEmans. 


By tHe Hon. N. C. Roruscuiup, M.A., F.L.S., F.E.S. 
(PuatE I.) 


In the December number of the ‘Entomologist’ for 1908, 
p. 281, we described a new species of five-combed bat-flea under 
the name of Nycteridopsylla longiceps, comparing it with another 
British species which we identified at that time as pentactenus, 
Kolenati. Our identification was based on specimens from 
Kolenati’s collection preserved in the Vienna Museum, with 
which the British ones agree fairly well. This identification has 
now proved to be erroneous, and we think therefore that a 
general survey of all the known species of the genus Nycteri- 
dopsylla may be attempted with advantage.

Kolenati originally described two species in ‘ Die Parasiten 
der Chiropteren’ under the names of pentactenus and tetractenus, 
which he subsequently united under the latter name in the 
‘ Hore Societatis Entomologice Rossice.’ The description and 
figure are insufficient, but two characters are mentioned which 
refer to this species only. In the ‘ Parasiten der Chiropteren ’ 
Kolenati states, under pentactenus, that the second segment of

the antenna bears six long bristles, while in the ‘ Hore’ the six 
bristles placed before the eye are noted as a character. In the 
specimens kindly forwarded to us by Dr. Oudemans there are five 
or six long bristles on the second segment of the antenna, while 
in the other two species of Nycteridopsylla there are only one to 
three of these long bristles. The second character, again, applies 
only to this species. We therefore concur with Dr. Oudemans in 
identifying this insect with N. pentactenus of Kolenati. 

N. pentactenus is easily recognized by the head (PI. I. fig. 1, 
3), the long bristles of the body, and the modified segments. 
The metathoracical sternite bears near the posterior edge a 
bristle which nearly reaches to the hind edge of the epimerum. 
The dorsal bristles of the thorax and abdomen are rather shorter 
than the lateral ones, while in the males of eusarca and longiceps 
the dorsal ones are prolonged. Dampf has given a fairly correct 
figure of the clasper of the male. The ninth sternite resembles 
that of longiceps (cf. Entom. 1908, Pl. VIII.), but the distal 
portion is more curved upwards, somewhat resembling the 
runners of a sleigh. The seventh abdominal sternite of the 
female is represented on our Plate (fig. 5). This sternite differs 
very essentially from that of the allied species. It has one 
sinus on each side, the lobe above the sinus being very broad 
and strongly rounded, while the lower lobe is narrow. 

Dr. Oudemans obtained this species off Vesperugo serotinus at 
Arnheim, in Holland. There are no examples of it among those 
of Kolenati’s specimens preserved in the Museum at Vienna, nor 
have we seen it from any other collection, with the exception of 
a single male example received from the Hazai Zoologiz Labo- 
ratorium at Budapest, taken off Plecotus auritus. in Hungary on 
December 15th, 1908. The species, however, may be expected 
to occur in Great Britain. 


2. Nycteridopsylla eusarca, Dampf. 

Nycteridopsylla eusarca, Dampf, Schrift. Phys.-okon. Ges. 

vol. xlviii. p. 898 (1908, Konigsberg) ; id., 1. c. vol. il. p. 45, 
fig. 3 (1908). 

The head (Pl. I. fig. 2, 3) bears only two long bristles on the 
frontal portion, and the club of the antenna is longer than in 
pentactenus. The dorsal bristles of the thorax and abdomen are 
prolonged in the male. The modified segments of both sexes 
are quite different from those of pentactenus. The non-movable 
process of the clasper of the male is short and broad, the apex 
being rounded, except on the distal side. The finger is much 
broader than in pectactenus, being widest above the centre. The 
seventh abdominal sternite of the female has a double sinus on 
each side as shown in PI. I. fig. 4. The lobes of this sternite do 
not actually lie in one plane, as represented in the figure ; the 
sinus therefore does not appear so large in an unmounted speci-

men as in a mounted (flattened) one. The size of the lobes 
varies somewhat in different individuals. 

- Kolenati’s specimens in the Vienna Museum belong to this 
species. N. eusarca is widely distributed, and apparently the 
commonest of the five-combed bat-fleas. It appears to vary 
geographically, as the specimens before us from different coun- 
tries do not exactly agree with one another. The material, 
however, from the Mediterranean countries which we have is 
quite insufficient to decide such a delicate point, and we therefore 
can at present establish but two geographical races. 


(a) Nycteridopsylla eusarca eusarca, Dampf, l. ¢. 

The author of eusarca has kindly given me in exchange a 
male and female of this form. ‘These two specimens show that 
Dampf must have made a mistake when he especially stated that 
the head of eusarca did not bear any bristles along the posterior 
edge. All our specimens of this species have a row of bristles in 
that place, as in the allied species (Pl. I. fig. 2). The movable 
finger of the clasper of the male is rather broad, being but 
slightly narrowed towards its base. The eighth tergite of the 
male has three long bristles at the upper edge between the 
stigma and the apical margin, besides a few shorter ones on 
the side. 

We have no specimens exactly agreeing with this form except 
the pair of co-types from East Prussia. A series of Austrian 
specimens are intermediate between N. e. eusarca and the British 
form described below, these Austrian specimens having the same 
small size as N. e. eusarea, while in the modified segments of the 
male they approach the British subspecies. 


(b) Nycteridopsylla eusarca major, subsp. nov. 

Ceratopsylla pentactenus, Saunders (nec Kolenati, 1856, err. 

determ.), Ent. Mo. Mag. (2), vol. i. p. 66 (1892). 

Nycteridopsylla pentactenus, Rothschild (nec Kolenati, 1856, 

err. determ.), Entom. vol. xli. p. 281 (1908). 

Both sexes are distinctly larger than in N. e. eusarca. The 
eighth tergite of the male bears four long bristles at the dorsal 
edge distally to the stigma; the movable finger of the clasper, 
though varying somewhat in individual specimens, is always 
strongly widened above the centre on the proximal side (PI. I. 
fig. 8); the non-movable process, moreover, is broader than 
in N. e. eusarca. The tibize have a few more lateral bristles on 
the inner and the outer side in both sexes. The lower lobe of the 
seventh sternite of the female is on an average broader than in 
Continental specimens. 

We have three males off Scotophilus noctula, obtained by 
Dr. D. Sharp at Cambridge in January, 1892, and one male and 
five females from the same locality and host collected by Mr. 

D2 


28 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


William Farren in 1900 and 1908. This species appears to be 
local in the British Islands. We have not found it or heard 
of it being taken on Noctules from any locality other than 
Cambridge. 
3. Nycteridopsylla longiceps, Rothsch. 
Ceratopsylla pentactenus, Rothschild (nec Kolenati, err. de- 
term.), Novit. Zoolog. vol. ii. p. 66 (1895) ; id., l.c. vol. v. 
p. 542 (1898). 

Nycteridopsylla longiceps, Rothschild, Entom. xli. p. 281 (1908). 

This species, when originally described in the ‘ Entomologist,’ 
was, as stated above, compared with N. eusarca major, that form 
being then erroneously identified as the true pentactenus. The 
male of the present species can be recognized at once by the 
great length of the head. In the female, however, this difference 
is not so apparent, as in eusarca the length of the head is con- 
siderably greater in the female than in the male. The modified 
segments of both sexes of longiceps are very distinctive taxonomic 
characters. In the male the movable finger of the clasper is 
very broad, and the apex of the ninth sternite is very much 
more obtuse than in N. eusarca. The seventh sternite of the 
female has but a single sinus on each side, the lobe above the 
sinus projecting far less than the one below it. 

We have received examples of this species from Great Britain, 
Firenze (Italy), and from Adana (Asia Minor). In fact, it 
appears to be the only member of the genus which is fairly 
widely distributed in the British Islands. Our British speci- 
mens have been collected from the following hosts: Scotophilus 
piprstrellus, Plecotus auritus, and Vespertilio nattereri.

Dr. Oudemans renamed Pulex vespertilionis of Bouché under 
the above name, stating that he considers this insect to belong to 
his new genus Nycteridopsylla on account of its possessing an 
eye. In Bouché’s original description no reference is made to an 
eye at all, and we are inclined to think that Taschenberg was 
correct in considering Bouché’s species to be identical with 
hexactenus of Kolenati. Dr. Oudemans, however, is correct in 
rejecting the name vespertilionis, as it had previously been 
eeuoyied by both Curtis* and by Dugés.t

THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITAA. 
By Groree Wuee er, M.A., F.E.S. 


(Continued from p. 7.) 


_Tuere are three principal directions in-which the species of 
this group tend to vary, viz. size, the distribution of the usual 
colouring, and the approach on the upper side to the more varie- 
gated Aurinia-group. The first of these has already been 
touched on and in some cases accounted for, nor has it, taken 
alone, given rise to any varietal name, except in the one (pro- 
bably mistaken) case of varia. Other sources of variation are 
the shape of the wings, which in some cases appears to be a 
local peculiarity, and the occasional approach on the under side 
to the Cinzia-group, which seems to be purely aberrational in 
character. Of the remaining directions of variation the approach 
on the upper side, especially in the female, to the Awrinia-group 
is perhaps the more widely interesting, but being in most cases 
by far the less conspicuous, it has not figured so largely as a 
cause of named varieties, and more particularly aberrations, as 
the unusual distribution of the ordinary colouring, and it is to 
the named forms that I wish now to direct attention. As a 
matter of personal opinion, I regard it as a somewhat un- 
necessary overloading both of the memory and of the ‘‘ variety ”’ 
list to name every intermediate form, though no doubt it serves 
here and there to recall to the minds of entomologists the names 
of some who have done valuable work which might otherwise be 
in danger of being forgotten—I allude to the work not the names ; 
but on the whole it would seem better if extreme forms only were 
named, and intermediates merely regarded as ‘transition to 
so-and-so,” or if all aberrant forms were called by the name of 
the well-marked form they most nearly resemble, and towards 
which they tend, without regard to the actual extent of the in- 
dividual aberration. But as this is now far past hoping for, so 
many names having already been given, some of them a very 
long time back, it is at any rate as well that we should know the 
forms to which the names really apply, a knowledge which can 
only be gained by reference to the original descriptions; though 
it is still quite permissible to refer to the same name forms 
nearly resembling the originals, especially in the case of those 
that are rather aberrational than varietal in character. One 
can hardly help feeling that in general the desire to possess 
named varieties, and the love of writing ‘‘ mihi,” or seeing one’s 
own name quoted, after the name of an insect, is more often 
responsible for the constant accumulation of aberrational names 
than any more scientific cause; and this accumulation has 
increased vastly since the time when Kingsley made such game 


30 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


of the subject in the ‘ Water-Babies,’ where he says that if the 
Professor’s dignity had allowed him to examine Tom instead of 
throwing him back into the water, he would have given him two 
long Latin names, the first of which would have told a little 
about Tom and the second all about himself, as of course he 
would have called him “‘ Hydroteknon Ptthmllnsprtsianum.” It 
was a good skit then—it would be a better now. 

Athalia, being by far the most generally distributed and 
perhaps also the most variable of the group, has naturally given 
rise to the largest number of named forms. We will take first 
those which depend on the unusual grouping of the ordinary 
black and fulvous of the upper side, a peculiarity usually, though 
not always, associated with more or less abnormality on the 
under side. The majority of these forms may be divided into 
two groups: in the first the fulvous, in the second the fuscous 
colour prevails. 

In the first group the oldest named form appears to be ab. 
corythaha, Hubner, ‘Beitrage,’ vol. ii. pt. ii. tab. 8, S, a, b 
(1790). 

In the remarks he makes on the illustration (p. 51) he 
expresses a doubt as to whether it is a good species or an aber- 
rant form of athalia. He gives no description of it, but refers 
to the illustration in which both upper and under side are shown, 
and from which the following description is made :— 

Up. s. f. w.: Mostly fulvous; a broad black border, to which the 
outer subterminal line appears to be joined, as there are no lunules ; 
the inner subterminal narrow; the upper part of the elbowed line 
wanting ; stigma black, triangular: two triangular black patches at 
the base, one on each side of the median nervure. 

Up. s. h. w.: Blackish, except for one row of fulvous spots near 
the border. 

Un. s. f. w.: Tip yellow, the rest of the wing fulvous, but with 
three short black dashes representing the costal part of the elbowed 
line, and a row nearer the base ; the outline of the stigma and the 
space between the basal lines each contain darker colouring ; below 
there is a basal dash. 

Un.s. h. w.: Outer half pale yellow, inner half fulvous, divided by 
a strong black line; the light spot apparently replaced by a black one, 
and all the spots of the basal band black; outer band represented by 
a row of five orange spots, the central part being unrepresented. 

This form, or something closely resembling it, has been 
treated by some of the older authors as a separate species. The 
name itself has, however, been variously employed. Hubner 
himself, in his ‘Sammlung,’ i. pl. 3, figs. 15, 16, appears to 
illustrate dictynna under this title ; what Freyer meant when he 
mentions it incidentally in his account of asteria (‘ Beitriage,’ 1. 
p- 116, 1828) it would have been impossible to guess, but in the 
‘Neuere Beitriage,’ iv. p. 49 (1852) he gives it as a synonym of 
dictynna, referring to the above-mentioned figure of Hubner. 


THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITA. 31 


ab. hertha was originally described by Quensel (‘ Vetenskaps 
Acadamie nya Handlingar,’ T. xil. p. 280, 1791) as a separate 
species, though it is really a form of athalia quite near to cory- 
thalia and pyronia. There are probably few forms of any of the 
group about which such a mistaken idea prevails; I have found 
but one instance—Lampa (‘ Tidskrift,’ 1889, p. 18)—of a descrip- 
tion, which has been taken from Quensel’s figure, loc. cit. pl. x. 
figs. 9 and 10, and it is certainly a case where it was necessary 
to consult the figure, for the original concise description is 
wholly inadequate. Itrunsas follows: ‘‘ Alis subdentatis fuscis, 
Supra anticis fascia maculari, posticis striga punctorum, fulvis.” 
A much longer Latin description follows, calling attention to the 
many peculiarities not previously noticed. The figure is un- 
coloured though excellent, and for the colouring of the following 
description I have used the longer description of Quensel :— 

Up.s.f. w.: The outer subterminal line sharply defined and no 
markings beyond it towards the base, except the large basal suffusion, 
which melts into the ground colour about one-third of the way across 
the wing ; the ground colour would seem to be somewhat lighter than 
usual, as in the longer description the word luwtews is substituted for 

ulvus. 
: Up. s. h. w.: As in corythalia, but with the light spot visible 
though obsolescent. 

Un. s. f. w.: Ground colour dull yellow (obscure luteus), the only 
markings being an indication of the outer subterminal line bordering 
the brightish yellow (flavescens) lunules, the outlines of the lower 
half of the stigma (or possibly the central part of the basal lines), and 
between these a series of very narrow longitudinal dashes of unequal 
length, so narrow as to be mere thin lines, and utterly unlike the black 
dashes of eos and some other forms; none of them extend so far 
either as the basal markings in the one direction or the outer subter- 
minal in the other. 

Un. s. h. w.: Spots of basal band coalescent, of a dull yellow 
(luteus), and rather strongly edged with black ; the inner band appa- 
rently represented by one dark (or black) spot; the inner part both of 
the central and outer bands black, the latter failing towards the 
costa; the outer band fulvous, the terminal and central of a bright 
yellow (flavus). 

It will readily be seen that this is a very remarkable form on 
the under side, even among the corythalia-group of aberrations, 
especially so on account of the fore wing. Aurivillius (‘ Nordens 
Fjarilar,’ p. 29, 1888), in his description of this form, makes no 
mention whatever of the un. s. f. w., and my own observation 
(‘ Butterflies of Switzerland,’ &amp;c., p. 91)—‘‘ with long black 
streaks un. s. f. w., but less black up. s. f. w.”—is a very fair 
sample of the inadequacy of most modern descriptions. 

ab. pyronia, Hubner, ‘ Sammlung,’ 1. pl. 114, figs. 585-588, 
$ and 2 up. and un. s. (1804), is a modification of the same 
form, with less of the dark colour on the up.s.f.w., and a 


32 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


light basal spot in addition to the row of fulvous spots on the 
up. s. h. w. On the un. s. f. w. are indications of the lines, and 
a dull darker band across the centre, both the black and the 
fulvous in the basal half of both wings being more concentrated. 
On the h. w. the lunular part of the outer band is present, and 
has a conspicuous black edging on both sides in the male, and 
on the inner side in the female. 

Freyer’s pyronia (‘ Neiierer Beitrige,’ iv. p. 14, tab. 295, fig. 2 
(1842) ) has more black on the base of the up. s. f. w., and the 
black streaks and markings of the following form (eos) on the 
un. s. f. w. are all present, but so obsolescent as to be no longer 
at all striking. 

ab. eos, Haworth, ‘ Lepidoptera Britannica,’ i. p. 85 (1808) is 
illustrated, from the same specimen, in the ‘Entomologist,’ x. 
p. 145 (1877); it is also beautifully painted in Stephens’s 
‘ Illustrations,’ i. pl. iv. figs. 1, 2 (1828) : and again (very badly) 
in Humphreys &amp; Westwood’s ‘ Butterflies,’ pl. viii. figs. 18, 14. 
It is a specimen taken ‘‘at Peckham, near London,” in June, 
1803, which was still, in 1877, in excellent preservation in 
possession of Mr. §. Stephens, F.L.S. It is very like the female 
pyronia illustrated by Hubner on the upper side, but the inner. 
subterminal line is distinct throughout. On the under side the 
hind wing is also very near to pyronia, except for the terminal 
and outer bands being more definite, but the fore wing not only 
has the subterminal lines very distinct though narrow, but has 
also the spots representing the elbowed line produced into very 
large, conspicuous, black dashes, taking the place of the dark 
band in pyronia, on which three very small black dashes below 
the costa are alone visible. Another specimen almost identical 
was taken in Sussex on June 28rd, 1907, and mentioned and 
figured by Frohawk, Entom. xl. p. 198.

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


LEUCOPHHA SURINAMENSIS (ORTHOPTERA).—Though interesting to 
the entomologist, the establishment of a new cockroach with us is 
looked upon in a different light by the gardener. L. swrinamensis 
certainly seems to be spreading somewhat rapidly. It is already a 
nuisance at Kew Gardens. I have just received a specimen for 
identification from Mr. G. T. Lyle, which was found crawling about 
on Christmas Day in a hothouse at Bishopstoke, Hants. — W. J. 
Lucas. 


ABERRATION OF MALACOSOMA NEUSTRIA.—Referring to the aberra- 
tion of Malacosoma neustria figured in your December number, I 
have four similar aberrations, all females, bred from ova of a Tiverton 
(Devon) female in July, 1896.— EH. F. Strupp; Oxton, Exeter, 
December 26th, 1908. 


Note on Lycrus cavaticutatus, F.—I recently had brought 
under my notice a length of thick lead gas-piping pierced through and 
through with tiny holes about 14 mm. in diameter. A piece of 
Australian “ hardwood” along which the pipe had been run was also 
given me. This showed the presence of small white grubs some 
4mm. to 5 mm. in length. I placed some of the wood in breeding- 
cages, and in a few weeks there emerged numbers of Lyctws cawali- 
culatus, so well known as a destroyer of wicker furniture. The holes 
in the lead pipe were cleanly drilled as by a sharp awl; their diameter 
at the top was slightly greater than at the bottom. The gas-pipe 
was between the roof and ceiling of a building here in Launceston, 
and the damage was only discovered when workmen were endeavour-

ing to ascertain the cause of the excessive escape of gas in the house. 
So far as I am aware this is the first occasion on which the larve of 
“this beetle have been recorded as destructive to lead in any form.— 
Frank M. Lirrter; Launceston, Tasmania, November 25th, 1908. 


MerconeMA VARIUM.— With regard to the remarks of Messrs. 
Swinton and Lucas on the figure in the ‘Entomologist’ for 1880, 
p- 252, I think there is no doubt whatever that it is wrongly named. 
For many years past I have been in the habit, during the late winter 
months, of gathering a large number of oak-galls (A. terminalis, with 
a few C. kollarz) for the purpose of breeding any small moths that 
had passed the winter therein as larvee or pupe. Amongst a great 
number of insects of various orders I have always bred some M. 
varium, a clear, unspotted, green little creature. When I first bred 
them I was much puzzled to find that they were quite spotless, when, 
according to the figure (loc. cit.), they should have been spotted! 
Leptophyes punctatissima is spotted from babyhood. That Mr. Bignell 
bred the species figured I have, of course, no doubt whatever, and, as 
Mr. Lucas tells us that it is generally found on low growth, those 
Mr. Bignell bred perhaps emerged from fallen galls. 1 shall have a 
day’s gall-hunting shortly, and will pick up all the fallen ones I can 
find, and may perhaps breed ZL. punctatissuma therefrom, if it occurs 
in this neighbourhood. With regard to the Lepidoptera bred, I have 
not been very successful. The following list comprises the lot :— 
Cryptoblabes bistriga (a single specimen), Hemimene fimbriana 
(scarce, about six or seven only), Pammene argyrana (a few), P. galli- 
colana (a large number on two occasions, but very few since), P. 
splendidulana (a few each spring), Carpocapsa juliana (two only), 
Gelechia luculella (about half a dozen), Gicophora sulphwrella (not 
uncommonly), Bucculatrix ulmella (three or four), Lithocolletis sp. ? 
(a single specimen many years ago), Nepticula subbimaculella (three 
only).—A. THurNALL ; Thornton Heath, January 6th, 1909. 


CHEIMATOBIA BRUMATA.—This troublesome pest has been gradu- 
ally increasing in numbers during the past few years. Considerable 
damage was done by the larve to fruit trees in some districts in 1907 
and 1908, and I fear 1909 may prove a record in this respect. As with 
H. defoliaria, the emergence was delayed by the mild weather. They 
began to appear at the beginning of November, increased slowly at 
first, then very rapidly, reaching their greatest numbers at the end of 
November and first fortnight of December. During that period the 
woods after dark presented an extraordinary spectacle. The moths 
were in countless numbers, and many thousands of pairs could be 
seen every night. I tried to form some idea of the number of brwmata 
per acre during early December ; it certainly was not less than fifty 
thousand, and may well have been double that number. I “grease- 
banded” most of my standard fruit trees; on each of three large 
apple trees I counted over a thousand females, notwithstanding that 
many had been brushed off when renewing the grease. In many 
cases the number of brwmata caught in the grease-band was so great 
that they formed a bridge for others to walk over. They have nearly 
all disappeared, but a few pairs may still be found every evening. (In 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 39 


1895 I found pairs on March Ist, but I believe that was following a 
prolonged frost.) A very unfortunate statement appeared in a scientific 
agricultural paper about twenty-five years ago to the effect that the 
females were transported by the males when pairing. This statement 
has been copied over and over again in various agricultural papers, 
&amp;e., and has deterred many fruit-growers from banding their trees. It 
is entirely unfounded, the male brwmata being quite incapable of 
flying with the female. Grease-banding, when properly carried out, 
is an effective remedy, the few ova laid below the bands being in- 
sufficient to cause harm. I notice that in this district brwmata 
flourishes more on the hills than in the valleys; last year and the 
year before this was very noticeable—Epwarp Goopwin, F.E.S. ;

DarkneEss.—The above experiment was carried out in the summer of 
1908 on larve collected in Huntingdonshire. My object was to 
ascertain the effect, if any, of breeding a large number of these larvae 
from the ovum or very early youth to the commencement of the 
pupal stage entirely, or almost entirely, in total darkness. The 
temperature of the breeding-cage was frequently taken, and was that 
of the outside air. The larvee were abundantly supplied with food, 
and they fed up in the same time as others kept under ordinary con- 
ditions. They were much darker than ordinary, being almost as 
black as those of V. to, with almost total obliteration of the yellow 
spiracular line: the pupz were also extremely dark as was antici- 
pated. Fifty-five butterflies emerged, and twenty-one were note- 
worthy as having an extension of the black spot on the inner margin 
towards the second costal spot. In a few cases these two spots were 
joined by a black line, as in var. polarzs, but more often by black 
scales between the two; the ground colour of the wings underwent 
no change. The proportion of butterflies with this black scaling was 
far higher than in a large number which as larve were given as much 
sunshine as possible, and others which had their food-plants saturated 
with water many times a day; the proportion among these was not 
more than five per cent. 1 have had no leisure to examine each 
specimen critically, and this note must be looked on as a pre- 
liminary announcement only.—(Lieut.-Col. R.A.M.C.) N. MANDERs ;

CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


STENOCEPHALUS AGILIS AND CORIXA AFFINIS (ATOMARIA) IN LAN- 
CASHIRE.—I took a single specimen of the former in Liverpool (July) 
and of the latter at Birkdale in May last. These are, I believe, the 
first specimens recorded for this county.—Oscar WHITTAKER ; Ls 
Lancaster Road, Birkdale, December 22nd, 1908. 


THYPHLOCYBA DEBILIS, Dougl., iv Lancasnrre.—I took a speci- 
men of this rare species on dwarf sallow here in July last year.— 
OscaR WHITTAKER.

PyRAMEIS IN JaNuARY.—I saw a fresh-looking specimen of 
Pyrameis atalanta flying in the sunshine in a sheltered hollow at 
Brook, Isle of Wight, on January 7th last—Orrorp Youne, M.D. ; 
Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, January 10th, 1909. 


Earty APPEARANCE OF HYBERNIA RUPICAPRARIA.—On 4th inst. 
several male specimens of this species were at rest on an electric 
illuminated window here.—Herrsert W. Baker; 73, Limetree Place, 
Stowmarket, Suffolk, January 6th, 1909. 

Erratwm.—In January number, page 18, line 16 from bottom, for 
“December 12th” read ‘“* December 17th.” 


TMNIOCAMPA GOTHICA IN JUNE AND OctospEeR.—I should like to 
record having taken a somewhat worn specimen of 7’. gothica on the 
flowers of Budleia globosa on June 12th, 1908, and a very perfect 
specimen at ivy bloom on October 15th. I also captured a good 
specimen of Acronycta psi at sugar on the evening of September 6th. 
—(Miss) B. Conny; Pucklechurch, Glos. 


PIERIS NAPI, var.—Last May I had a very large number of 
brassice, rape, and napi, and among the more or less interesting 
forms that appeared were a fine male napz with the basal portion of 
all fore wings conspicuously black. Mr. Raynor—who was here 
yesterday—strongly urged me to send you a note of its occurrence, 
and thought it deserved a varietal name, so we decided to call it basv- 
mgra. A similar but somewhat more pronounced form of brassic@ is 
figured in Morris’s ‘ British Butterflies,’ having been copied from 
‘The Zoologist,’ p. 471. It was taken in a garden in Leicester in 
1843. I have always been on the look-out for this form, but though 
I have bred and captured many thousands of specimens, I never 
met with anything approaching it previously—W. H. Harwoop,; 
94, Station Road, Colchester, September 4th, 1908. 


PTEROPHORUS MONODACTYLUS IN JANUARY.—On Esher Common, 
January 2nd, I observed Pterophorus monodactylus; first, at rest 
about two feet from the ground on oak palings above dead leaves and 
behind brambles, and later on, high up on the trunk of a Scotch fir. 
This capture may serve to confirm the belief that this moth hyber- 
nates during the winter months, flying only at times in favourable 
weather.—D. C. Houmes; The Briars, Manor Road, Thames Ditton, 
January 4th, 1909. 

[This species most certainly passes the winter in the moth 
state, but, except perhaps during the coldest weather, it does not 
seem to become absolutely dormant. It is often seen among the 
latest insect visitors to ivy bloom and the earliest to the sallow 
catkins.—Eb. | 


HYBERNIA LEUCOPH#%ARIA ON JANUARY 8TH.—On the oak-fence of 
Ksher Common I took to-day a male H. leucophearia, It was a dark 
nicely banded specimen, and seems worthy of record, the date being 
so very early.—D. C. Hommzs. 


CAMPODEA STAPHYLINUS (ApTERA).—In rotting stumps from which 
trees have been cut down, I found to-day (January 8th, 1909) several 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 41 


specimens of this very simple insect, this being, I think, the first 
time I have noticed it during the winter months. With it was a 
small centipede of the order Symphyla, and apparently of the genus 
Scolopendrella, which resembles it so closely as to give one the 
idea that there may be a connection here between the Myriapoda 
and Insecta—an opinion which has of course been put forward.— 
W. J. Lucas. 


SPHINX CONVOLVULI IN WiutTsHIRE, 1908.—I omitted to record 
during November that I had two very fine specimens of S. convolvulz 
brought me, one taken in Salisbury city, the other in the village of 
Broadchalke, a few miles out. They are male and female, both 
perfect. The female was taken in mid-October, the male in early 
November.— W. A. Bogue; Sunnybrae, Kirtleton Avenue, Wey- 
mouth, December 27th, 1908. 


PERIPLANETA AUSTRALASIZ IN Cornwatu.—In May, 1906, I took 
a fine specimen of this cockroach at Truro. I have only recently 
identified same whilst reading the ‘ Entomologist,’ vol. xxix. p. 124, 
with an excellent drawing of same on p.97, both pages indicating the 
distinct differences between this species and P. americana. The note 
referred to above is by Mr. W. J. Lucas, who indicates that this 
insect is not a common one; I have therefore thought it might be of 
interest to send my record—W. A. Rox~uason; Lamorna, Truro, 
Cornwall, January 4th, 1909. 


PHIGALIA PEDARIA.— Although this species is most often seen 
during the first three months of the year, chiefly in February, odd 
specimens have been noted in November and December. This seems 
to have been the case last year, as Mr. B. Weddell, of Selkirk, informs 
us that a living male specimen was brought to him on November 2nd. 
Another example is reported from Haslemere, taken on a street lamp, 
November 28th; and a male was taken, also on a gas-lamp, at Wey- 
mouth, on December 21st. 


HYBERNIA DEFOLIARIA.—Having noticed an unusual number of 
the larve of this species last summer, I was not surprised to find the 
insects plentiful this winter. They commenced to emerge early in 
October, but, owing to the exceptionally mild weather, they appeared 
very slowly, and it was not till the end of November that they were 
well out. From that time until the beginning of January the males 
were very common, but I came across very few females. The year 
closed with a few days’ frost and snow, quickly followed by a return 
of mild weather. On January 2nd I found a number of males and 
females emerging, principally the latter, and I noticed during the 
evening seventy or eighty pairs. Since then they have depreciated 
both in number and quality, but even at this date (January 14th) a 
few are quite fresh. I must have examined some thousands of males, 
but I found very few exceptional varieties. —Epwarp Goopwiy, F.E.5.; 
Canon Court, Wateringbury, Kent. 


Captures AT Ligut In THE CHESTER District.—The following 
captures have been effected at the Chester and district electric lamps

since November, 1907 :—Cerwra bifida (4), Zeuzera esculi (1), Sphinx 
convolvult (2), Acherontia atropos (3), Petasia cassinea (3), T'enio- 
campa gracilis (1), Pheosia dicteoides (1), Agrotis suffusa (5), Dasy- 
polia templi (1, fourth recorded example since 1907), Himera pennaria 
(5)—ALFRED NEwsTEAD; Grosvenor Museum, Chester. 


Notes From Merssina.—I reached here on the 9th November 
last; temperature 73° in the shade, which later on fell to 67°, at 
which it now stands. During the last few days rain has fallen 
heavily, but without lessening the heat. The butterflies on the hills 
near the town are nearly all such as are found (sometimes only 
occasionally) in England. The common butterflies here are Preris 
rape@ (this occurs in centre of town) and P. brassice; and I captured 
a fine specimen of P. daplidice (November 19th). Colzas edusa flies 
about rapidly on the hill-sides; I have only taken males. Pararge 
meg@ra is common near the torrent-beds. P. egeria (one), the local 
form. Chrysophanus phleas, on the hill-sides. Pyrameis atalanta, 
this is the commonest of the Vanesside here, and occurs in gardens, 
roads, &amp;c. P. cardwt, a few; but strange to say I have not seen 
either wrtice or 70. This comprises the list of butterflies I have 
noticed in mid-November, just a dozen species in all. Moths are 
scarce; three small species taken. Grasshoppers abound, also a few 
locusts and beetles. I watched a lizard pounce upon a good-sized 
grasshopper ; it tried to get away into a hole in the wall and slipped 
down two or three feet, but stuck fast to its prey and then dis- 
appeared. Caterpillars are not much in evidence. I noticed some 
on heath (a species of) on Monte Ciccio, and left them to grow 
bigger. I think they may belong to a species allied to Lasiocampa 
quercus. During the winter I am not expecting many other species 
of butterfly to turn up, but shall look forward to the spring.— 
J. Puarr-BaRrrett.

Mr. Rowland E. Turner; Mr. J. W. Tutt; and Mr. C. O. Water- 
house. The outgoing President, Mr. C. O. Waterhouse, having 
alluded to the loss the Society had sustained in the death of seven 
Fellows, took as the subject of his address, ‘“‘ The Claws of Insects.” 
After briefly describing the various forms of insects’ claws which 
are classified as toothed, appendiculate, bifid, or pectinate; and 
having given examples of each, he suggested as a subject for investi- 
gation, which he hoped entomologists would take up as a study, 
“Are these forms of claw merely the result.of heredity without any 
special object, or is there evidence to show that the different forms 
are adapted to different modes of life; in fact, have been developed to 
meet special needs?’’ He then proceeded to show, by numerous 
examples, that closely allied species often had dissimilar claws; that 
insects with quite different habits had the same form of claw; and 
that others with different forms of claw seemed to have the same 
habits. The question therefore appeared to be still an open one, 
requiring careful investigation, and he appealed for more field obser- 
vation with a view to solve this and many other problems. —

chair: The Annual Exhibition of Varieties—Mr. Adlard, Bartholo- 
mew Close, E.C., was elected a member.—Mr. South exhibited series 
of Cirrhedia vaccinii and C. ligula from the Continent, and discussed 
at length the various forms and named varieties, comparing them 
with British examples. He also showed the Cucullia species pre- 
viously shown, stating that upon examination of the genitalia by Mr. 
Pierce, three of the Continental males were shown to be C. lychnitis 
and two C. verbasct, and one bred from a larva found feeding on Scro- 
phulartia nodosa in North Kent proved to be C. verbasci also.— 
Messrs. Harrison and Main, an extensive bred series of Aplecta nebu- 
losa, with a large proportion of var. robsont and var. thompsonz, and 
gave notes and statistics of the results. They also showed a bred 
gynandrous specimen of Preris napi, left side male, right side female.- 
—Mr. R. Adkin, series of Boarmia genmaria (rhomboidaria), com- 
prising typical and black forms reared from wild ova in 1907, and a 
portion of Edward Newman’s series of the same species and of var. 
perfumaria, and discussed the last-named form. He also showed 
Anthrocera achillee from Argyllshire, Nola albulalis from East 
Sussex, 1908, a variety of Chrysophanus phleas of a coppery shade 
with the red band reduced to narrow bars, an example of Aglazs 
urtice with very large blue lunules and tips of fore wings streaked 
with pale blue-grey, together with a case containing pupa-skins 
in sit of several of the rarer Sesiide, resinous nodules with cocoons 
of Retinea resinella, one of which had been appropriated by a larva 
of Dioryctria abietella, cocoons of Nola centonalis and of Hylophila 
bicolorana; also Zenillia roseane, a dipterous parasite on the larve 
of Tortrix pronubana, new to Britain.—Mr. G. T. Porritt, varieties of

M. aurima—Mr. Hy. J. Turner, extremes in size of Polyommatus 
damon from the Alps; a number of species of the genus Brenthis, in 
which the submarginal spots and lunules were more or less coales- 
cent ; a nice series of Satyrus cordula from Vissoye, with female var. 
peas ; and a box containing numerous species of Rhopalocera from 
German Hast Africa and from Biké in Central Africa.—Myr. Lucas, 
the large earwig Labidura riparia, which he had kept alive for some 
months, feeding it on fish.—Mr. Tonge, Szrex noctilco, taken in his 
house at Reigate.-—Mr. Edelsten, a long series of the new British 
species Nonagria neurica from Sussex, with Continental examples ; 
and series from various localities of N. dissoluta and var. arundineta. 
—Mr. Joy, an unusually pale example of Argynnis paphia—Mr. 
Ashdown, a long series of the Longicorn, Strangalia armata, to show 
the range of variation in the markings.—Mr. H. W. Andrews,

Tarbat, a box containing examples of forty-one species of Lepido- 
ptera taken at Fareham, settling on a white wall in the full glare of 
a strong electric light, including Stawropus fagi, Hpunda mgra, 
Luperina cespitis, Nonagria typhe, &amp;e. He also showed a Melitea 
aurinia with unusually small spotting; a Teniocampa gothica, with 
the ‘character’? reduced to two small spots; and a Malacosoma 
neustria with a very broad, uniformly wide band across the fore

European species of the genus Hrebia, including E. christi.—Mr. 
J. P. Barrett a communication from Sicily, noting some twelve 
species of Rhopalocera which he had met with near Messina in mid- 
_ winter, including C. edusa, Pararge megera, P. egeria, Heodes phleas, 
Pieris daplidice, &amp;e.—Hy. J. Turner, Hon. Rep. Sec. 

A correction: An obvious mistake was made in the report of 
October 22nd, when “sallow” was given as the food-plant of Limenitis 
sibylla, instead of ‘“ honeysuckle.” 


Crry or Lonpon Enromonoaican Socrety.—November 18th. — 
Mr. H. M. Edelsten exhibited Nonagria neurica (Hubn.) from 
Sussex, new to the British list; also N. dissoluta and var. arun- 
dineta from various localities. — Mr. G. H. Heath, Thyatira batis 
with pink coloration in spots replaced by brown, and Mvana_ stri- 
gilis with red central fascia and white marginal band, both from 
Ashford, Kent, 1908.—Dr. G. G. C. Hodgson, Zygzenide from one 
Surrey locality, mainly Z. trifolii and Z. hippocrepidis, including 
several melanic examples of the former, two apparent trifolit with 
a sixth spot, and an apparent hippocrepidis with right-hand wings 
resembling minos.—Mr. L. W. Newman, a long series of Vanessa 
c-album, including a few specimens with the c transformed into a D.

doubledayaria bred from doubledayaria female taken at Wicken.— 
Mr. L. W. Newman read some interesting notes on observations 
made while breeding Vanessa c-album, and recorded the following as 
facts observed by him: (a) The first ten or fifteen ova laid by female 
in spring produce var. hutchinsoni. (b) The remainder of the ova 
laid by female in spring produce the typical form. (c) The hutchin- 
sont imagines emerge first, pair, and lay the ova which produce the 
autumn brood (d) The typicalimagines emerge later, refuse to pair, 
either inter se or with hutchinsoni, and go into hybernation early in 
the summer. (c) So far as specimens in captivity are concerned, this 
attempt at hybernation does not succeed, the imagines dying during 
the winter or early spring.—S. J. Bet, Hon. Sec.

Tis volume maintains the excellence we noted in regard to

It completes the view of the species usually described as ‘ Macros,”

than several families towards the end of the volume. 

The outstanding feature, as of the previous volumes, is the repre-

sentation of all the species dealt with by colour photography, chiefly 
from the actual specimens. The merits of these plates it would be 
difficult to exaggerate, although two or three seem a little out of 
focus, and in one the colours have escaped exact superposition. 

The Plusias may perhaps be selected for special notice. Whether 
anyone who had never seen a Plusia would realize from the plates 
that certain portions of the wings shine metallically may be difficult 
to decide, but those who cannot place themselves in that untutored 
attitude will see almost the insects themselves, with their silver, 
bronze, or gold markings. Those from drawings by Mr. Knight, e.g. 
the frontispiece (Pl. 1), leave nothing to be desired; between these, 
however, and those photographed directly from the insect there is the 
difference that here every blemish in the specimen is eliminated, 
whilst in the others every injury and defect is faithfully recorded, as, 
for example, one sees that the specimen of P. bractea was not 
in so fine condition as some of the others. This, from our point 
of view, so far from being a blemish, is an unquestionable certificate 
of truthfulness to nature, since it shows the specimen as it is, 
and not as we or the artist, possibly erroneously, may think it ought 
to be. 

One might have liked more of the admirable photographs in the 
text by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Main, altogether twenty or twenty-four, 
if we include those on the covers, as they illustrate, by what are often 
beautiful pictures, interesting points, such as natural attitudes, means 
of concealment, &amp;c. 

It would perhaps be unkind to enlarge again on our objections to 
the unfortunate adoption of English names. Not perhaps always 
unfortunate, as who can help failing to find some amusement in such 
names as ‘The Silver Hook,” ‘‘The Dark Spinach,” ‘The Slender- 
striped Rufous,” or ‘The Brussels Lace” ? : 

The plain plates of earlier stages are somewhat unequal, some 
very good, some less so—all useful to give the beginner some idea of 
the egg, larva, or pupa of the particular species, or of the group to 
which it belongs. 

Perhaps we ought to note that the latest addition to the British 
Macros, 4. achillee, is figured and noticed, as well as the new and 
interesting dark var. of H. autwmnaria just discovered by Mr. L. W. 
Newman ; so that the work is quite up to date. 

We notice few errata; that in the legend on Pl. 77 is obvious, and 
will mislead no one. The reference to the early stages of H. autwm- 
narta is erroneous both in text and index. 

We have looked for as many faults as possible, possibly from envy 
that such an excellent and complete guide, at so low a price, affords 
the tyro such help as was not to be obtained in our early days, even 
from an expensive library—an assistance that will last him until he 
begins to specialize in some direction or other. Probably it is 
necessary, now that entomology affords so many wide fields for 
study, that the early stages should be made so easy, and capable, 
therefore, of being rapidly mastered. 

Such samplings of the text as we have made show Mr. South to 
have that command of his subject with which we all credit him, and

probably one might read from cover to cover without finding any 
errors. 

There is apparently not to be a further volume of “ Micros,” and 
when the young entomologist begins the ‘‘ Micros” he will pre- 
sumably want something more advanced than the present work 
affords. This is perhaps doubtful, but if he asks us where he is to 
get it, we cannot tell him. There is surely room now for a work on 
our smaller moths, with illustrations of the imagines similar to those 
Mr. South gives us, and photographs of their mines, cases, &amp;c., and 
with distinct, if brief, notes on their life-history—a book useful not 
only to the tyro but also to the advanced student ; if it could cater for 
both without seriously disappointing either it ought to be successful 
commercially also. T A.C 


The Evaniide, Ensign-Flies ; an Archaic Family of Hymenoptera. 
By J. Cuester Bravery. (‘ Transactions’ of the American 
Entomological Society, 1908, pp. 101-194 and pls. v.—xv.) 


THis is a most valuable contribution to our knowledge of this 
aberrant and somewhat heterogeneous family of the Parasitica. The 
author begins with a short consideration of its general features, 
tabulates the world’s genera of the subfamily Aulacine, treats briefly 
of the Foenine and at more length of the Evaniine, concluding with 
a catalogue of the world’s species of this third division. To British 
students (if there be such!) the most interesting point is the restora- 
tion of the generic term Fe@nus, adopted by Marshall in his British 
Catalogue of 1874, but which has ever since given place upon the 
Continent to the nomen nudum, Gasterwption, Latreille. Our in- 
'digenous species are sadly in need of revision—a very simple matter 
since but seven were known in 1874, and only one (fenus minutus, 
Tourn.) has since been added (cf. Entom. xiii. p. 89). Of these, 
Trigonalys is said by Mr. Bradley not to belong to the Evaniide at 
all, and modern Continental authors have extended their penchant for 
“unrecognizable species” (whether the type be extant or not) to 
Fenus jaculator, Linn. Mr. Bradley’s plates are excellent, and are 
mainly reproduced from photomicrographs.

his residence, Weston Park, Crouch End, N., on the 16th inst., from 
an attack of angina pectoris. Tor several years past he had suffered 
from a slight heart trouble, and this was severely aggravated by a 
dastardly attack made upon him by a street thief in an attempt 
to rob him. He was born in Aldermanbury, in the City of London, 
November 15th, 1842, and in his younger days resided with his 
parents at Homerton, and here first evinced his taste for ento- 
mology at the early age of six years, the neighbouring and exten- 
sive Lea Marshes being then a very rich collecting ground for the 
entomologist. After serving a time as assistant to a medical prac- 
titioner (the late Dr. Kibbler), he established himself in the chemist 
and druggist business in the Broadway, London Fields, which he 
successfully carried on for many years until he retired to private life, 
about twelve years since, and took up his residence at Crouch End, 
where his Friday ‘“‘At Homes” for some years past have given 
his numerous friends most enjoyable opportunities of inspecting his 
magnificent collection of British Lepidoptera and other natural 
history treasures, and hearing much of interest concerning them 
from their most genial host. Although possessed of a vast store of © 
knowledge of the earlier stages, habits, and variations of our in- 
digenous Macro- and Micro-Lepidoptera, he seldom published any- 
thing relating to them; his ‘‘ Revision of Peronea cristana and its 
Varieties ” (of which he possessed an enormous and unrivalled series), 
which appeared in the ‘Entomologist’s Record,’ vol. xiii., is perhaps 
the best known and most important of his contributions to entomo- 
logical literature. For the several past years he was preparing a 
similar revision of the named varieties of Sarrothripa revayana and 
Teras literana, both of which, unfortunately, remain incomplete. His 
very extensive collection of British Lepidoptera, equally rich in both 
macros and micros, and occupying over two hundred drawers, is 
remarkable for the large number of superb varieties and aberrations, 
the fine bred series of most of the species, the very perfect state of 
preservation, and careful and uniform setting. We believe the whole 
will be shortly offered for sale. 

Apart from entomology, he was an enthusiastic collector of birds, 
and was often out with his gun on the Lea Marshes by 4 a.m. until 
time to return for business, and his collection, preserved and mounted 
by himself, includes many rarities and interesting varieties. 

He was elected a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London 
in 1886, and was one of the founders of the old Haggerstone Entomo- 
logical Society, established in 1858, and now known as the City of 
London Entomological and Natural History Society, remaining an 
active member and officer until the last. 

He was twice married, his second wife, to whom he was married 
in 1904, and his three daughters surviving him. ae

MARCH, 1909. [No. 550 


LIFE-HISTORY OF ARGYNNIS LAODICE. 
By F. W. Fronawk, M.B.O.U., F.E.S. 
(Prater IT.) 


On September 17th, 1907, I received from the Hon. N. Charles 
Rothschild a number of eggs of Argynnis laodice, obtained from 
four females captured by himself near Cséhtelek, in the Bihar 
Comitat, Hungary. The four specimens were placed on potted- 
up plants of dog-violet (Viola canina), with the satisfactory 
result that about one hundred and seventy eggs were deposited 
on various parts of the leaves and stems. By acquiring this 
consignment of ova I have been enabled, through Mr. Rothschild’s 
kindness, to have the pleasure of successfully working out the 
complete life-history of this rare species, which I believe has 
never been previously accomplished, and, excepting the full- 
grown larva and pupa that were described and figured twenty-six 
years ago by G. Kunow (‘Schriften d. Physik, Oekon Geselbech, 
zu Konigsberg,’ vol. xii. p. 147, 1872), nothing hitherto was 
known of any of the earlier stages. 

Aigner has already recorded (‘ Rovartani Lapok,’ vol. xiv. 
p: 222, 1907) the capture of the specimens of this Argynnis by 
Mr. Rothschild. 

This species, which apparently only occurs in the Réz Moun- 
tains and not on the plain, frequents open spaces in the forest in 
the neighbourhood of streams, where it flies in company with 
A. paphia, A. adippe, and A. lathonia, frequenting the blossoms 
of bramble and of hemp-agrimony. All the specimens that 
Mr. Rothschild secured were worn, being taken from about the 
middle of August onwards, and were mostly females. Apparently 
the locality where these were captured is the most western point 
in Hungary, and possibly in Europe, at which this species has 
been observed. 

The ege resembles that of Argynnis adippe in shape and 
general structure, but in the number of keels it is more similar 
to A. aglaia. It is conical in form but rather straight-sided, and 
gz In. in height ; the base is twice the width of the crown, which

3 in.long. Similar to previous stage, excepting the tubercles, 
which are of a delicate lilac-pink, bearing black bristles; head 
and legs ochreous, former speckled with brown, and a central 
V-shaped mark and black eye-spots. During the greater part of 
the day they rest at the base of the plant and under the leaves ; 
towards evening they ascend the leaves to feed. 

After fifth and last moult, fully grown, it measures about 
1} in. long. The body slightly tapers at each end. There are 
in all sixty-two rather long tubercles (spines), four on the first 
segment, two on the second, four on the third and twelfth; on 
all the remaining segments, fourth to eleventh inclusive, have 
each six spines; these run in longitudinal rows, being dorsal, 
subdorsal, and lateral; the first pair on the anterior segment 
are slightly longer than the rest, and project over the head, but 
curve gently backwards; the second and third pairs are only 
slightly curved ; all the other spines are straight. All bear 
numerous black, shining bristles, and each terminates with the 
same. ‘The outline of all the spines is undulating, the space be- 
tween each bristle being convex; most of the spines are of a 
semi-transparent, pearly, milk-white colour, with the bases more 
or less lilac-pink ; those on the first segment are wholly rose- 
pink, and the succeeding ones gradually become paler, while 
those on the anal segment are likewise rose-pink ; all have dull 
rose or lilac-pink bases. The general ground colour of the body 
is olive-brown, being composed of a cream-coloured ground, 
finely mottled with dull black, forming an irregular chequered 
pattern ; the ventral surface is much darker, mostly of a deep 
olive-brown; there is a medio-dorsal cream-coloured longi- 
tudinal stripe, divided by a fine blackish line; on each segment 
bordering the stripe is a conspicuous, bold, velvety-black mark, 
divided in the centre by the dorsal spine; the anterior portion 
is quadrangular and posterior half triangular ; a slightly oblique 
elongated mark below and behind each dorsal spine excepting the 
first ; along the side is a subdorsal series of dusky markings, 
bordered on each side by a cream-coloured line forming a wavy 
band, broken up by the subdorsal spines; below each of these 
spines, surrounding the spiracles, are bold black mottlings; the 
subspiracular spines are situated on the dilated lateral undu- 
lating ridge, which is dull milky white. The head is flesh- 
colour, freckled with brown; eye-spots black ; a rose-coloured 
spot on each side of the crown, which is brown in front, with a 
central \-shaped whitish mark outlining the head-pieces. The 
legs are coloured like the head ; the claspers are rich red-brown. 
The anal segment terminates in a conical point of a rust-reddish 
colour; on the ventral surface of this segment are warty emi- 
nences clustered with black bristles, as well as on the anal 
point ; the head and claspers are all bristle-bearing. 

Kunow’s figure of the enlargement of the segment does not 


LIFE-HISTORY OF ARGYNNIS LAODICE. 58 


accurately portray the structure or markings of this larva; he 
represents the spines as straight-edged, and the bristles much too 
small, and the colouring of the spines of the sixth segment, 
which he figures as being wholly pink, are in all the larve in my 
possession as I have described. He neither shows the second 
dorsal slightly oblique mark, nor the subdorsal markings forming 
a band. In his figure of the larva there is wanting much detail 
of markings ; the first and last spines are much too short, and 
represented as being quite straight, which should be longest and 
curved on the anterior segment, and they are all too dull in 
colour. 

On June 22nd the first larva attached itself by its hind 
claspers to a pad of silk spun on the gauze cover, and pupated 
on the 24th. Just after pupation it is mostly of a brownish- 
pink colour, which gradually deepens into a shining bronze-black, 
with a few ochreous-brown speckles appearing on the abdomen. 
The metallic spots of the mature pupa are at first exactly similar 
to mother-of-pearl. 

The pupa averages in length 42 in.; it so closely resembles 
A. paplia in structure and markings that they are almost in- 
distinguishable, and as regards colouring A. laodice and the 
dark forms of A. paphia are exactly alike. The only slight diffe- 
rence between the two species is that in paphia the subdorsal 
angular projections on the third abdominal segment are rather 
larger than those of laodice, and when viewed dorsally paphia is 
rather wider across the base of the wings. 

A. laodice pupa, dorsal view: Head with two pointed lateral 
horns, a similar but smaller angular point at base of wings ; con- 
tinued along the base is a convex ridge, then concave across the 
middle, and bulging at hind margin; abdomen attenuated to 
anal extremity. Side view: Head beaked, thorax keeled and 
angular, sunken at base of abdomen and metathorax ; abdomen 
curving to anal segment, which terminates in a truncated pro- 
jection bearing the cremastral hooks ; ventral surface of abdomen 
contracted ; wings bulging near apex; antenne serrated; leg- 
joints prominent. 

Colouring: Ground colour pale buff-brown, inclining to pinkish 
over the head and thorax; there are two subdorsal rows of 
sharply pointed conical projections commencing on the prothorax ; 
the first five pairs are of a beautiful metallic silver-gilt ; these are 
placed on the three thoracic segments and the first two abdominal 
segments ; the remaining pairs are without metallic lustre, being 
shining variegated brown; those on the third segment are 
largest, and those on the ninth are very minute; on the fifth, 
sixth, and seventh segments are very small medio-dorsal points. 
The whole surface is very finely reticulated with dark brown, 
forming a delicate fibrous pattern ; across the wing are two wavy 
brown bands, exactly similar to paphia; the dark spiracles are

placed on a dusky stripe, and the ventral abdominal surface is 
indistinctly striped. 


Kiinow says a striking point about this pupa is the extreme 
prominence of the feet and feelers. I do not, however, find any 
striking difference from that of A. paphia in either the legs or 
antenne.

THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITAA. 
By George WHEELER, M.A., F.E.S. 
(Continued from p. 32.) 


Tau next two forms do not so clearly belong to this group, 
but still they are remarkable for presenting a greater display of 
the fulvous ground colour, the one on the fore, the other on the 
hind wing, though in the former case the hind wing seems to be- 
long rather to the other or navarina-group, as, indeed, is the 
case with hertha, and even with corythalia itself. The first of the 
two is :— : 

ab. hisopa, Sélys-Longchamps, ‘‘ Enumération des Insectes 
Lépidopteres de la Belgique,” p. 19 (published in the ‘ Mémoires 
de la Societé Scientifique de Liege, 1845). It is described as 
follows :—‘‘ Dessus* des ailes brun. Les supérieures avec trois 
bandes de taches fauves trés larges, les inférieures avec une 
bande seule analogue antéterminale. Dessous des inférieures 
avec quatre taches arrondies noires a la base qui est fauve. Cette 
couleur terminée par du noir. Le reste d’un jaune clair, avec 
les nervures et une raie antéterminale noires et une série trans- 
verse de cing taches fauves non cerclées de noir.”’ 

This series of five transverse fulvous spots evidently repre- 
sents the outer band. I know no illustration of this aberration, ~ 
but the description is sufficiently clear. 

The name is spelt nisopa in the ‘ Annales de la Société Ento- 
mologique Belge,’ i. p. 19 (1857), in the list of Belgian forms of 
Lepidoptera.

four rounded black spots at the base, which is fulvous edged with black. The 
rest of the wing is light yellow, with the nervures and one antemarginal line 
black, and a transverse series of five fulvous spots, without any black edging. 


THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELIT@MA. 55 


The second of these forms is the— 

var. helvetica, Ruhl, ‘ Societas Entomologica,’ ii. p. 187 
(1888), which he also describes in his ‘ Palaéarktische Gross- 
Schmetterlinge,’ p. 405 (1892-1895). In the former work there 
is a long Latin description which my respect for the author 
compels me to refrain from giving in the original, so startling is 
its construction, and which I will therefore, contrary to my usual 
practice, translate as follows :—‘‘ Wings scarcely rounded, ful- 
vous above, partially reticulated with fuscous, the hind wings 
with the central band enlarged, in distinct streaks, and forming 
five definitely separate streaks, of which the second and third 
are longer than the first, fourth, and fifth. The hind wings 
beneath yellowish, with the middle band silvery white. This 
form is so far remarkable for a very noticeable mark in the 
second basal cell of the hind wings beneath, a yellow oblong spot 
bordered with black, alike in both wings.” 

This form is remarkable for three things: the complete 
absence of the extra line, up. s.h. w., in combination with a very 
restricted basal suffusion, leaving a broad central band of the 
ground colour, such as is usual in parthenie; the silvery white 
central band, un. s. h. w., in the male as well as the female; and 
the size, shape, and colour of the second spot of the basal band. 
It appears to be a local form found at Bergun and Stalla, in the 
Grisons, in July. The upper side gives a remarkable facies, 
which I have several times noticed in Rhone Valley specimens, 
but without the peculiarities of the under side, though I have 
also taken at Freniéres, above Bex, a very fresh male with 
quite white terminal, central, and basal bands, the light spot also 
being white; this specimen, however, has a normal upper side. 

To this group of aberrant forms also belong three others, 
viz. -— 

ab. samonica, Riesen, ‘Stettin Entomologische Zeitung,’ 
1891, p. 357, which is described as having the upper side of 
corythalia, but the under side normal. 

ab. virgata, Tutt, ‘ British Butterflies,’ p. 305 (1896), which 
‘‘has the spots forming the central band of the fore and hind 
wings lengthened, and these make a distinctly marked central 
band.” 

ab. obsoleta, Tutt, l.c., is thus noted: ‘‘ Occasionally there 
is a failure, or partial failure, of the dark transverse lines, the 
wings becoming largely fulvous.”’ 

We must also add the local Spanish form :— 

ab. iberica, Staudinger, ‘ Catalogue,’ 38rd ed. p. 32 (1901), 
which is thus shortly described: ‘‘ Plerumque major, dilutior, 
minus nigro picta.”’ 

Coming now to the second group of aberrations in which the 
fuscous predominates, the oldest named form which belongs with 
certainty to this species (athalia) seems to be :— 


56 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


ab. navarina, Sélys-Longchamps, ‘ Enumération des Insectes 
Lépidoptéres de la Belgique’ (v. supra), p. 19, 1845. His de- 
scription reads as follows* :—‘‘ Toute brune en dessus avec une 
série antéterminale de taches fauves. Le dessous des ailes 
plus noir qu’a l’ordinaire.”” He states that he is describing the 
insect figured by Ernst &amp; Engramelle, ‘ Papillons de l’Europe,’ 
vol. ii. pl. lxii. suppl. viii. figs. 81 e, f (1780), and referred by 
them, p. 252, to Esper, ‘Schmetterlinge Europas,’ i. p. 382, 
which is his description of dictynna illustrated on pl. xlviii. 
(suppl. xxiv.). Sélys-Longchamps consequently remarks that 
the absence of the black spots in the outer band un. s. h. w. at 
once removes it from dictynna, and, indeed, Ernst &amp; Engramelle 
refer their figures back to their first volume, pl. xix. fig. 81, and 
the corresponding letterpress, pp. 67, 68 (1779), where a further 
reference is made to the previous plate of Esper (i. pl. xlvii. 
suppl. xxiil.), which represents athalia. The following descrip- 
tion is made from the figure to which Sélys-Longchamps 
refers :— 

Up.s.f. w.: Ground colour only shows between the subterminal 
lines and in a single spot outside, and two inside the stigma; on 
h. w. only between the outer and inner lines, and in the light spot. 

Un. s. f. w.: Lunules yellow, with a few yellow spots below the 
costa and about half-way down the wing inside the outer sub- 
terminal ; beyond this the whole wing is fulvous, with a series of six 
long, rather wedge-shaped, black dashes starting from the inner sub- 
terminal, a square black spot taking the place of the stigma, and an 
pbieng black spot in the middle of the base representing the basal 
dash. 

Un. s. h. w.: Terminal band shows dull grey spots near the arch 
of the lunules except at anal angle; inner part of the outer and 
central bands black; outer part of central band pale yellow: rest 
of wing fulvous, except the light spot and the first, third, and fourth 
spots of the basal band, which are of the same shade as the spots 
in the terminal lunules. (This colour may have changed in the plate.) 

A variant of this aberration is figured, without name, by 
Hubner, ‘ Beitrage,’ ii. pl. iv. fig. W. 1, 2, the under side of 
which has the outer part of the fore wing very pale, the spots 
forming the elbowed line prolonged into dashes, the stigma and 
the space between the basal lines being filled in with black, and 
the basal dash being represented by a triangular black spot. The 
hind wing appears to have the usual bands, but the outer has the 
dark lunules very slightly represented, and failing altogether to- 
wards the costa, the space between them and the central band 
being filled in with black in the lower half of the wing ; most of 
the base is also black. 

A Dutch specimen referable to this form is also illustrated 


* “ Entirely brown above, with an antemarginal series of orange-brown 
spots. The under side with more black than usual.” 


THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITA. 57 


for a paper by Capper in the ‘ Tijdschrift voor Kntomologie,’ 
vol. xii. pl. ii. fig. 8, the upper side of which is definitely nava- 
rina, but the under side is nearly normal, except that the elbowed 
line is again represented by a series of black dashes. Fig. 4 on 
the same plate represents a transitional female, showing on the 
upper side two rows of fulvous spots on the fore wing, and part 
of a third row on the hind wing. The under side is like that of 
the male, except that the black dashes representing the elbowed 
line are shorter. 

ab. aphea, Hubner, ‘Sammlung,’ vol.i. pl. 147, figs. 738, 739, 
probably represents an aberrant form of this species, but in the 
absence of date and locality it is impossible to speak with con- 
fidence. Most authors have, however, accepted it as such with- 
out question. The following is a description :— 

Un. s. f. w.: Outer subterminal coalescing with border; inner 
subterminal very fine ; elbowed line very broad, almost reaching the 
inner subterminal; the basal suffusion forms two large. black spots, 
one above the median nervure reaching to the inner basal line, and 
another below it joining the marginal blotch ; beyond the outer basal 
line is a black blotch followed by yet another surrounded by a thin 
line of the ground colour, which expands into a bar towards the inner 
margin. 

Up. s. h. w.: Has a broad black border, followed by a narrow 
lunular line of the ground colour, edged with an equally narrow 
lunular line of black representing the outer line; the basal suffusion 
extends to the inner line, but shows just within the latter a row 
and part of a second row of very small spots of the ground colour ; 
the light basal spot is prolonged into a scimitar-shaped curve up to 
the costa. 

Un. s. f. w.: Has black Iunules almost filling the usual terminal 
lunules, whose arrangement rather suggests parthenie. This peculi- 
arity is exaggerated on the hind wing. The elbowed line is repre- 
sented by large elongated spots, and the basal band of the hind wing 
is completely invaded by the dark inner band; otherwise the under 
side is fairly normal. 

This must not be confounded with Freyer’s aphea, ‘ Neuere 
Beitrage,’ vii. p. 169, pl. 696, fig. 1 (1858), which appears to be 
a form of parthenie which one meets with occasionally in the 
Rhone Valley, and doubtless elsewhere. Its sole distinction, 
which, however, produces a very remarkable facies, is the great 
breadth of the elbowed line, and the unusual size of the marginal 
blotch on the upper side. 

This form brings us by a natural sequence, though somewhat 
out of chronological order, to the corresponding form of athalia, 
var. mehadiensis, Gerhardt, ‘ Berliner Entomologischer Zeit- 
schrift,’ vol. xxvi. p. 126 (1882). Itis described as follows* :— 


* A very beautiful aberration of athalia, striking in consequence of its 
pronounced markings; from Viertlau, Mehadia (Hungary) ; rather larger 
than ordinary athalia ; the black band crossing the middle of the fore wing 


58 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


‘‘Hine sehr schone, durch deutlich ausgesprachte Zeichnung 
auffallende Abart von Athalia: von Viertlau, Mehadia: etwas 
erosser als die gewohnliche Athalia; die in der Mitte der Ober- 
flugel uber den ganzen Fliigel sich ziehende schwarze Binde ist 
breiter als bei der Stammart, und endét am Innenrand in einen 
langlich viereckigen Fleck, der bei der Stammart gewohnlich 
nur durchbrochen erscheint. Auch auf der Unterseite ist 
die Binde weit deutlicher markirt als bei der gewohnlichen 
Athalia.” 

Here again the breadth of the elbowed line and the large 
oblong marginal blotch are the special characteristics. It ap- 
pears to be rather a variety than an aberration, and so far as 
the upper side is concerned it is, apart from size, the usual form 
at Faido, in the Levenitina, and indeed, in a more or less modi- 
fied condition, the only form I have seen from that locality.

ORTHNTAL CAPSIDZ. 
By W. L. Distant. 5 


Mr. R. I. Pocock, who is working out the mimetic relation- 
ship between various insects and spiders included in a collection 
from the Nilgiri Hills, has asked me to identify the following 
Rhynchota, in order that he may be able to refer to them in his 
paper shortly to be published in the ‘ Transactions’ of the Lin- 
nean Society of London. All the species belong to the Capside, 
are apparently undeseribed, and will be figured in the Appendix 
to my Rhynchotal portion of the Faun. Brit. India. 


RHOoDocLIA, gen. nov. 


Head broad and convex, a little more anteriorly produced in male 
than in female, the postocular longer than the anteocular area, 
strongly constricted at base, slightly longitudinally incised on centre 
of disk, the apex subangularly produced in front of the insertion of 
the antenne, eyes of moderate size and rounded; antennz long, 
longer than the body, first joint longer than either the second or 
third which are subequal in length, fourth longest, moderately thick- 
ened and a little curved; rostrum passing the intermediate coxa, 
first joint thickened and about reaching eyes, second longest; pro- 
notum short, armed with a long horizontal or slightly backwardly 
directed slender spine on each side; hemelytra more or less rudi- 
mentary, more developed in the male than in the female; abdomen 


is broader than in the type, and ends on the inner margin in a longish four- 
cornered spot, which in the type generally appears broken up. On the 
under side also the band is far more strongly marked than in ordinary 
athalia. 


ORIENTAL CAPSIDE. 59 


short and broad, pedunculate at base; legs long and slender, basal 
and apical joints of tarsi about equally long, tibize distinctly longer 
than the femora. 


This genus may be placed in the Division Myrmecophyaria, 
Reut. 


Rhodoclia convictionis, sp. n. 


Head, pronotum, scutellum, and hemelytra piceous-brown ; head 
with a pale ochraceous line extending centrally and perpendicularly 
for a short distance from base, and then curved and diverging on each 
side to the anterior margins of eyes ; scutellum with a central pale 
longitudinal line; abdomen greyish ochraceous ; head beneath, ster- 
num, rostrum, and legs pale brownish ochraceous ; the pedunculate 
base of abdomen centrally piceous, with the lateral margins greyish ; 
legs and antenne thinly spinously hirsute, the head also margined 
with pale long hairs. Long. 3 6 to 8, 2? 54 to 6 millim. 


Hab. Nilgiri Hills; Barwood Estate (H. Leslie Andrews). 


ZARATUS, gen. Nov. 


Head subtriangular, obliquely deflected in front of eyes, mode- 
rately centrally longitudinally suleate on disk, eyes of moderate size 
but alittle projecting beyond the anterior margin of the pronotum ; 
antenns with the first joint nearly as long as head, second joint 
more than twice as long as first, third longer than first, fourth muti- 
lated; rostrum not reaching the anterior cox, first joint about 
reaching base of head; pronotum elongate, but a little broader at 
base than long, transversely constricted a little before anterior mar- 
gin, posteriorly convexly tumid, anterior and posterior margins trun- 
cate, the lateral margins narrowing to apex, angularly sinuate at the 
transverse constriction, thence straight to anterior margin ; scutellum 
small, subtriangular ; clavus long, almost reaching to base of cuneus ; 
corium with the lateral margins strongly concavely sinuate, broadly 
widened at the cuneal area; membrane slightly passing the abdomi- 
nal apex ; abdomen broad, globose, constricted at base ; legs of mode- 
rate length, the posterior tarsi mutilated. 


Allied to the Neotropical genus Zosippus, Dist., from which 
it principally differs by the unarmed scutellum. 


Zaratus repandus, sp.n. 

Head, pronotum, and scutellum pale ecinnamon-brown; scutellum 
with an obscure pale concave line and a small basal spot; corium 
pale cinnamon-brown, an oblique basal spot on each side, which are

and a transverse concave fascia on each side before cuneus whitish, 
the cuneal suture more obscurely whitish ; membrane black, with an 
obscure pale transverse fascia near base; legs pale cinnamon-brown, 
apices of femora and about apical thirds of tibia and the tarsi pale 
stramineous, apices of tarsi black (posterior tarsi mutilated) ; antenne 
pale ochraceous, third joint, excluding base, black ; body beneath im- 
perfectly seen in carded specimens. Long. 4 millim. 


Hab. Nilgiri Hills; Barwood Estate (H. Leslie Andrews). 


60 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Armachanus nilgiriensis, sp. 0. 

Pale brownish ochraceous, a transverse linear white fascia cross- 
ing clavus near apex of scutellum, and an oblique similar fascia near 
middle of corium; before the latter the lateral area is also more or 
less greyish white ; cuneus with a prominent black basal spot ; mem- 
brane very pale fuliginous ; body beneath and legs unicolorous. Some- 
what closely allied to A. monoceros, Dist., but a more slender and 
attenuated species, the posterior pronotal area shorter, the anterior 
area longer, narrower, and moderately narrowed at base, thus bringing 
the two areas or lobes into more divisional character and into greater 
contrast ; the head is more elongate, and has a median longitudinal 
darker line; the scutellum, clavus, and central area of corium are not 
darker in hue as in A. monoceros, but concolorous with the general 
pale brownish ochraceous coloration. Long. 6 millim. 


Hab. Nilgiri Hills; Barwood Estate (H. Leslie Andrews). 


Nicostratus princeps, sp.n. 

Brownish ochraceous ; a transverse white fascia crossing corium 
and clavus at apex of scutellum; membrane piceous; head very large 
and globose, almost circular, about as long as broad, with a transverse 
rounded incised line between the eyes; antennz pale ochraceous, 
apices of second and third joints, and the apical joint excluding base, 
black, second joint subequal in length to that of third and fourth 
together ; pronotum strongly transversely constricted before middle, 
the anterior area or lobe narrow and armed with two strong diverging 
spines, the posterior area or lobe globosely tumid, deflected anteriorly, 
the lateral angles subprominent, the posterior margin very slightly 
concayely sinuate; scutellum developed into a strong upright semi- 
acute spine; corium with the lateral margins concavely sinuate, 
widened and tumid at apices; membrane considerably passing the 
abdominal apex; legs almost uniformly brownish ochraceous. Length, 
5 millim. 


Hab. Nilgiri Hills; Barwood Estate (H. Leslie Andrews). 
Strongly differing from N. balteatus, Dist., by the much larger 


and more strongly developed head, different colour, more acute 
spine to scutellum, &amp;c. 


COMACLA SENEX, Hs., as. FUMOSA, N. as. 
By Eustace R. Banxss, M.A., F.E.S. 


Fore wings smoky brown. Hind wings rather paler. The usual 
blackish markings are present on all the wings, but are rendered very 
inconspicuous by the darkness of the ground-colour. Head, thorax, 
abdomen, &amp;c., proportionately dark as compared with the type. 


This aberration, which I have not seen from elsewhere, and 
of which I have failed to find any published figure or description, 


NOTES ON BRACONIDZ. 61 


occurred to me very sparingly, in 1906-7, in the Isle of Purbeck, 
Dorset, in company with numerous examples of the better-known 
forms, and my captures included individuals of every shade be- 
tween the darkest representatives of ab. fumosa and the typical 
form. The fact that I have not taken any females referable to 
ab. fumosa affords no good reason for supposing that this dusky 
aberration is confined to the opposite sex, for the total number 
of females that has rewarded my efforts is very limited. 


Norden, Corfe Castle: Nov. 10th, 1908. 


NOTES ON BRACONIDA.—VIII.: ON A PART OF 
MARSHALL’S COLLECTION. 


By Cxuaupe Mortey, F.E.S., &amp;c. 


Wut looking through the earlier part of the Rey. T. A. 
Marshall’s collection of Braconide, which has now passed from 
the late Dr. P. B. Mason to a resting place in the British 
Museum, in January, I jotted down a few notes, which will 
add several species to the British list, and others of general 
interest. 

I should, first, like to say that my record of Bracon flavator, 
Fab., as an indigenous species (EH. M. M. 1908, p. 269) is quite 
wrong; the insect is in reality Doryctes leucogaster, Nees, a 
common kind along all the coasts of the Mediterranean, and 
known to extend as far north as Central Europe, though no 
mention of it as British exists. It has been several times bred 
from the Longicorn beetles Rhagium indagator and Hylotrypes 
bajulus. There is, however, certainly a female of B. flavator, 
Fab., in the Stephensian collection, under the name B. deni- 
grator, applied by Curtis (B. E. pl. lxix.) to Proterops nigripennis, 
Wesm. ‘This may, of course, be British, though none have 
since been discovered. I found a single female of Bracon im- 
postor, Scop., under the same name in Stephens’s collection. 
This is a somewhat frequent species in Central and Southern 
Europe, preying upon Monochammus sutor, a Longicorn occa- 
sionally introduced into the British docks, though doubtfully 
indigenous, and its parasite may have been similarly imported. 
Bracon initiator of Stephens’s collection (et Wesm. nec Fab.) = 
Celtodes scolyticida, Wesm., male and female. Bracon instabilis, 
Marsh. (André, xv. 1897, 70) from Cornwall (type in Brit. Mus., 
with a second, both labelled ‘‘ Botusfleming’’), and B. virgatus, 
Marsh. (lb. cit. 68) from Cornwall (type in Brit. Mus., labelled 
*‘ Botusfleming,” with a second from Cameron’s collection, labelled 
‘‘Marsh Mills, June 80th”), are new to Britain. B. roberti, 


62 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


which I erroneously stated (E. M. M. 1908, p. 269) to have been 
hitherto not bred, is said (André, xv. 1897, 80) to have been 
raised by Bignell, in Devon, from Coccyx strobilella, Linn. There 
are specimens of Bracon abscissor, first noted as indigenous by 
me (EK. M. M. 1906, p. 109), from Swanage, Nunton in Wilts, 
Cornworthy, Botusfleming, and Niton, in Isle of Wight; it is 
probably not rare. Of B. piger, Wesm., previously only noted 
from Belgium, there are examples from both Cornworthy, in 
Devonshire, and Nantes, in France. JB. intercessor is not re- 
corded as British; there is a male bred ‘‘ by W. H. B. Fletcher 
from Gelechia obsoletella; Bridgman has three more,” presumably 
contained in his collection, now in the Castle Museum at 
Norwich. &lt;A female Bracon scutellaris, Wesm., also new to 
Britain, is labelled ‘‘ Plumstead, lst June, 1893.” B. subcylin- 
dricus, Wesm., is. represented as indigenous by a single female, 
captured by Marshall in the ‘‘Isle of Wight.” I have just 
examined a female B. fulvipes, Nees, bred by H. M. Edelsten on 
July 15th, 1908, from Cenobta rufa. 

Exothecus incertus, Wesm., must be added to our fauna on 
the strength of a single male in Marshall’s collection, captured 
by him at Botusfleming, in Cornwall. In like manner we must 
include Clinocentrus stigmaticus, Marsh., next to our C. vestigator, 
on the strength of an example (not in the collection), recorded 
by him (André, xv. 181). Allodorus semirugosus, Nees, has not 
been found with us before. There are three examples in the 
collection, two labelled ‘‘ Aviemore, 28, 76,” by Champion, and 
one from ‘‘ Rannoch,” in Marshall’s handwriting; it is one of 
the Sigalphides. It is very remarkable how few of each species 
Marshall possessed in the Areolarii; nearly all are represented 
by one, two, or three specimens only. ‘The most populous is 
Apanteles fulvipes, Hal., of which there are eighteen. Nearly all 
the bred examples are from Bignell’s collection, and one can but 
wonder that, with such a paucity of material, Marshall arrived 
at so full a knowledge of the group; how full it is can only be 
shown by subsequent work upon it, though personally I have 
found but few specimens which could not be assigned to one or 
other of his excellent descriptions. Of Agathis there are but 
two males of A. brevisetis, Nees, and a single female of his 
A. angelice from Britain ; though A. malvacearum is represented 
from Corsica, A. nigra from Nantua, in the Jura Mountains, and 
A. tibialis, ex coll. Konow, from Mecklenberg. Marshall had 
already taken Apanteles tenebrosus, brought forward by me from 
Britain (Entom. May, 1906), at Nunton, in Wilts. Microdus 
pumilus, Ratz., also new to our fauna, is represented by a female 
found by him at Cornworthy, near Totnes.

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


THE AB. PORRITTIL OF CIDARIA SUFFUMATA. — For the sake of 
clearness in the future it seems advisable to state that the figure of 
Cidarva suffumata given as ab. porritti in Mr. South’s most excellent 
second volume of the ‘ Moths of the British Isles’ just published 
(plate 72, fig. 2) does not represent the form as originally named by 
Robson. The figure has evidently been taken from a specimen of the 
well-known so-called ‘‘ Dover form,’ whereas the ab. porritti is really 
a black and white moth, the white by daylight being a little “creamy.” 
The basal mark and central band are black, the rest of the wings 
white, with the exception of the short line near the apex of the fore 
wings, the minute marginal dots, and the faint darker clouding at the 
base of the hind wings. The form is well figured in the ‘ Entomolo- 
gist’ of May, 1878, and in Barrett’s ‘ Lepidoptera of the British 
Islands,’ vol. viii. pl. 359, figs. ldand 1h. The “ Dover form” has 
the pale parts of the wings marked with brown. It also always 
occurs in South-west Yorkshire along with ab. porritti, and in much 
greater numbers, and that ab. porritta is the extreme form of it (in 
which the brown is obliterated) is proved, I think, by the fact that I

THERONIA ATALANTH, Poda, as BririsH. —I have seen a fine 
female of this species in the British Museum, which was captured 
“near Ramsgate, September, 1891,” but the identity of the captor is 
doubtful (cf. my ‘Ichneumons of Britain,’ iii. 51). This distinct | 
and handsome species, which preys mainly upon Rhopalocera, may 
now be considered as certainly indigenous to our fauna.—CLAUDE

Tue EnromonocicaL Crus.—Since the last report (Entom. xli. 
229) meetings of this Club were held at 58, Kensington Mansions, 
South Kensington, on December 8th, 1908, and in the Council Cham- 
ber of the Holborn Restaurant on January 19th, 1909. 

On the date first mentioned Mr. Horace St. John K. Donisthorpe 
was in the chair, and the other members present were Messrs. R. 
Adkin, H. Rowland-Brown, and G. H. Verrall; the additional guests 
numbered fourteen. At this meeting Mr. Rowland-Brown proposed 
that Mr. A. H. Jones be elected an Honorary Member of the Club ; 
this having been seconded by Mr. Donisthorpe was carried. 

At the Holborn meeting, which is recognized as the ‘‘ Annual” of 
the Club, Mr. G. H. Verrall occupied the chair, as it has been his 
wont to do at about the same date for the past twenty-two years. 
Other members present were Messrs. R. Adkin, H. St. John K. Donis- 
thorpe, and T. W. Hall; and of other entomologists invited as guests 
nearly seventy attended. After supper the chairman, in proposing 
the toast of the “ Entomological Club,’ made some apt remarks on 
the seeming lack of workers and students in British insects other than 
Lepidoptera. Later on, in replying to the toast of “Our Host,” 
which was proposed by Dr. Dixey and acclaimed with musical 
honours by the guests, Mr. Verrall mentioned that biographical 
details of some past members of the Club were still wanted to com- 
plete the set of memoirs in course of preparation.

Harty APPEARANCE OF HUPITHECIA PUMILATA.— A specimen of 
this pretty little moth was found to-day at rest on the wall of an up- 
stairs passage in this house, not far from a landing-window, through 
which it must have flown, probably attracted by an adjacent gaslight. 
This is a remarkably early date, but the weather for the past three or 
four weeks has been so abnormally changeable that one is scarcely 
surprised at it. After a week’s hard frost, at the end of December, 
the New Year commenced with a spell of mild weather, which lasted 
until January 19th, when frost set in again, and went on until the end 
of the month, the last three or four days being very severe. Then on 
February 1st it became suddenly very mild, the thermometer for three

days rising as high as 56° and 57°, and keeping above 50° throughout 
the night—the sort of temperature one expects towards the end of 
May—but on the 6th it became cold again, and to-day there has been 
the heaviest fall of snow we have had for some years. The moth 
looks as if it had been out for some days, so it most likely emerged 
during the very warm weather we had at the beginning of the month.

BAPTA BIMACULATA IN LINCOLNSHIRE.—I have taken B. bimaculata 
here in 1906, 1907, and 1908. These constitute, I believe, the only 
records for this moth for Lincolnshire.— Savienac B. STEDMAN; 
Binbrook, Market Rasen, Lincoln. 


DyYSCHORISTA SUSPECTA IN SuRREY.—My brother very kindly 
sugars for me in Surrey, and last July he sent me a series of nearly 
twenty specimens of Dyschorista suspecta, captured near Effingham. 
As suspecta is always described as a northern insect, this record may 
be worth insertion.—Savieanac B. SrEDMAN. 

[This species was taken pretty freely in the New Forest, Hamp- 
shire, in 1896; it has also been recorded from other southern 
counties.—ED. | 


Notes FRoM HASLEMERE FOR 1908.—In continuation of my notes 
for 1906-7 (vide Entom. vol. xli. p. 157), the following may be of 
interest :—Limenitis sibylla has been observed in more than one 
spot about here, and I imagine it is quite firmly established. I had 
no opportunity of obtaining the larvee, but hope to do so this year. 
On June 15th I obtained ova of Cenonympha pamphilus in large 
numbers, and the larve began to emerge on June 28th. They all fed 
very slowly, and none pupated in the autumn. I have kept them 
supplied with grass all the winter, and they appear to have been 
eating in very small quantities without any break. The largest is now 
little more than half an inch long. Two female specimens of Callo- 
phrys rubi deposited about forty ova on laburnum shoots on May 
29th. The resultant larvee appeared on June oth, and fed up success- 
fully on the flowers and later on the leaves of broom. The first one 
pupated on July 14th. Larve of Zephyrus quercus, beaten on June 
3rd, appeared to be even more than usually ichneumoned, but I got 
through some fine imagines on July 5th and following days. After 
diligent searching in their known haunts I succeeded in finding ova 
on Nov. 4th. Spring forms of Cyaniris argiolus began to emerge on 
April 4th, though the first date on which I saw wild ones was May 
97th. A brood of larvz, which hatched on June 6th, and which 
began to pupate on July 11th, produced some imagines on July 30th, 
but several of the pupze stood over the winter. It was difficult, 
especially during the later stages, to procure holly blossoms, but the 
larvee, though preferring the flowers, very readily ate the young holly 
leaves. 

Among interesting captures by day may be mentioned :—Hylo- 
phila prasinana, H. bicolorana, Lithosia mesomella, Nemeophila 
russula, Hepialus humuli, Drepana binaria, Heliaca tenebrata, Eras- 
tria fasciana, Hpione advenaria, Metrocampa margaritaria, Hurymene 
dolabraria, Numeria pulveraria, Bupalus piniaria, Pachyenemia hip-

pocastanaria, Coremia designata, Cidaria suffumata, and Chesias 
rufata. 

Larve of the following, among others, were taken :—Notodonta 
ziczac, Thyatira batis, Gortyna ochracea, Panolis piniperda, Miselia 
oxyacanthe, Agriopis aprilina, Hadena protea ; and ova were obtained 
from Pecilocampa populi, Epunda nigra, Corenna designata, Chesias 
spartvata, and many others. 

From the street-lamps the most noteworthy captures were :— 
Pecilocampa popult (in greater profusion than ever before within my 
experience), Notodonta dictea, N. trimacula, Polyploca flavicornis, 
Demas coryli, Asteroscopus sphinx, EHupithecia pulchellata, H. succen- 
taureata, Cidaria siterata, C. miata, C. suffwmata, C. silaceata vay. 
msulata, and Aniatis plagiata. 

Sugaring in my garden produced :— Acronycta psi, A. aceris, 
Dipterygia scabriuscula, Apamea basilinea, A. gemina, Miana strigilis, 
M. fasciuncula, Rusina tenebrosa, Noctua festiva, Orthosia lota, Ceras- 
tis vaccini, C. ligula, Scopelosoma satellitia, Xanthia cerago var. 
flavescens, Epunda nigra, Miselia oxyacanthe, Agriopis aprilina, 
Aplecta prasina, A. miata, Hadena protea, H. thalassina, Calocampa 
exoleta, and Xylina semibrunnea.. It is perhaps worth recording that 
a friend of mine, who was sugaring almost every night about three 
miles from my house, took two specimens of Cymatophora fluctuosa. 

In most cases I have made no mention of the species taken by me 
here in previous years, the majority of which turned up again. But 
the interesting list of new species taken by my friend and myself in 
1908 leads us to regard this as a very favourable locality, and we hope 
to be able to work it even more thoroughly this year. — I’. A. Oup-

ENTOMOLOGY IN CoRNWALL AND Devon In Juny, 1908.—Contrary 
to my usual custom of spending my holiday on the Continent, I last 
season decided to give old England another trial. Having re-read a 
very interesting article by Mr. A. E. Gibbs in the ‘Entomologist’ 
(vol. xxxix.) ona holiday he spent at Polzeath, and what specimens 
he collected there, I decided to follow out Mr. Gibbs’s directions, and 
accordingly caught the 6.20 a.m. train from Waterloo (a comfortable 
corridor), which did not stop between London and Salisbury. At 
Okehampton we had to change into a slower train, but the scenery 
being so beautiful one did not regret the slower progress. I reached 
Wadebridge at one o’clock; it had been raining, and I at once . 
inquired at the station about a conveyance for getting my stock of 
treacle, carbide, ‘‘ setting house,” and other heavy luggage taken the 
seven miles. As luck would have it there was a carrier going that 
way there and then. I next asked about accommodation; one man 
informed me he knew of no place where one could stay, but the 
carrier’s boy, who now came upon the scene, informed me that there 
was a lady who “took people in,” and I felt greatly relieved until the 
boy added he did not know if the lady in question was “full up” or 
not. However, I decided to risk it, and immediately made for the 
Station Hotel, and, having lunched, the rain seeming over, I mounted 
my bike and made a start. After a mile or so the rain came on again 
so much so that I took shelter under some trees; after some time I

donned my waterproof suit and decided to ride through it, the clouds 
cleared, and it was then pleasant travelling, and at length I reached 
Polzeath. I was told the name was originally Hayle, and it was 
altered because the people would insist on pronouncing it as if it was 
the infernal regions. I found the lady was “full up,” and I had to 
search elsewhere. The next Cove, Trebetherick, contained a boarding- 
house, principally used by golfers, but was then almost empty, and 
Mr. Buse, the landlord, made me very comfortable, the ménage was 
excellent, and the charges were very moderate. There are only two 
or three more houses in the place, and these are farms. The spot is 
really just at the mouth of the river Camel (from which Camelford 
takes its name). A few minutes’ walk brought me down to the 
sea (or river, whichever one likes to call it). It seemed an ideal 
spot for “sugaring’’—there was a row of posts, also sand-hills, and 
a field of thistles and ragwort—and I decided to give it a trial 
the same evening; but, alas, the only thing I took out of the 
common was Agrotis valligera, one specimen; Leucania conigera, 
L. lithargyria, and, of course, the ubiquitous Xylophasia polyodon 
were plentiful. 

The next day I decided to search for Mr. Gibbs’s spot, so fully 
described, as before stated; having discovered it, I decided to work 
it the same evening. I may say along the road during the afternoon 
I discovered a wing of Agrotis lunigera in a spider’s web, so I knew 
one of the moths which I hoped to get was about. I had never 
taken this species, although I had tried Freshwater for it, but Mr. 
A. J. Hodges told me the time of appearance given by Newman is 
incorrect, and that is probably the reason why I had never captured 
the insect. I took but one specimen of lwnigera that night. I think 
the place must have altered considerably since Mr. Gibbs was there ; 
there are very few posts, and they are across a ditch and much over- 
grown with foliage. The other Leucanias I have mentioned appeared 
again. The next night I was more successful, and secured three 
lunigera ; altogether I captured seven during my stay. I saw nothing 
of Newria saponarie, Hadena adusta, and Triphena interjecta ; never 
having previously taken these species, I was naturally disappointed. 
Mr. Gibbs thinks a house is now built on the spot where he used to 
get them. M. rivata and H. mensuraria were netted. I was 
detained a whole week by the English weather (I won’t say climate). 
An American, on being asked what he thought of our English 
climate, replied, ‘I guess you ain’t got no climate, it’s all weather,” 
and this is generally true so far as my experience goes. 

The first fine sunny day I rose at seven, and cycled to St. Ives. 
As this article is for a scientific journal, I must not give too much 
of what, for want of a better appellation, I may call “domestic ” 
news. I will then not give details of the very pleasant spin over the 
moors, up hill and down dale, in the fifty-five miles’ spin to St. Ives. 
At Hayle Bay the sand-hills are enormous, reminding one of the 
Boulogne-Abbeville route. Large quantities of red valerian and wild 
flowers are found along the cliffs at St. Ives, but I netted nothing of 
importance. Delayed a few hours next day by the weather again, I 
was late in leaving for Land’s End; I found a comfortable hotel 
there, and a landlord that Charles Dickens might have made use of, 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 69 


He told me that if I purchased curiosities and other things he had 
for sale and sent them to my friends, they would exclaim, ‘‘ How 
kind it is of my friend to send me these pretty things.’ Well, to 
return to the Lepidoptera. I treacled rocks and flowers suitable 
to hold that substance, and the result was the common species 
before mentioned. It was very lovely at Land’s End, the sun was 
shining brightly when I left, and I had an enjoyable spin to Pen- 
zance, went over St. Michael’s Mount; but if one has visited Mont 
St. Michel in Normandy, it is only waste of time to visit the English 
mount. I, however, discovered some Silene maritima in the castle 
grounds. I had been searching in vain for this plant in Polzeath in 
hopes of getting Dianthacia barrettii ; although I found some plants 
on my return, and visited them by night, I saw nothing of the moth. 
Having trained to Truro, I rode the rest of the way ved Padstow 
Ferry to Rock (but I don’t advise anyone to go this way, at least, not 
with a bicycle), and reached Polzeath in time to treacle the same 
night. 

Having sent home some of my luggage, I left for Tintagel and 
Boscastle, sugared along the cliffs of the latter place, but had no luck. 
At Bude I found a few sand-hills, and had the same bad luck with 
regard to captures. The most charming spot I think I have ever seen 
(Clovelly) was reached the next day, and thence, vid Bideford and 
Barnstaple, to the famous Braunton Burrows. I stayed at a very 
comfortable golf house at Saunton, above the Burrows; the latter com- 
prise three miles of sand-hills. Finding no posts I sugared flowers, 
but nothing other than common species were taken. I cycled the 
three miles on the sands to the lighthouse, and then found I was 
opposite Instow, from which place I once, years ago, joined some 
entomological friends and went for a picnic to the lighthouse; I had 
no idea it was Braunton Burrows at that time. I collected a quantity 
of sticks, stuck them in the sand-hills, and sugared them the same 
evening, but the same bad luck attended me. 

I may mention I was trying a new experiment on this tour; 
instead of “ papering ”’ my captures (readers may ask what captures ? 
and with reason, for as yet I had very few), I was setting everything 
I took while fresh, and for this purpose was carrying a ‘drying 
house” with me on the front ‘“luggage-carrier”’ of my bicycle; this 
mode of setting things when fresh is much preferable to relaxing and 
setting specimens after one’s return home. I always experience a 
difficulty in relaxing and setting British moths when once they have 
become dry, the antennx are almost always stiff and refuse to go in 
the desired position. Mr. Newman’s new relaxing-tin may overcome 
this trouble; so far I have found it very useful, I have left an insect 
in for over a month without any appearance of mould. After leaving 
Braunton I made for Barnstaple, and soon got on the Lynton Road, 
which, winding as it does in and out along the valleys over moors 
in places and through woods occasionally, makes cycling very 
enjoyable. A sharp descent brings one into the picturesque village 
of Paracombe. 

At length one arrives at the model town of Lynton, which owes 
its popularity largely to Sir George Newnes, M.P. A long and steep 
descent, rather too rough to ride down with any pleasure, and one is

in the bright little village of Lynmouth. After having selected an 
hotel, I made my way along the Lynn in search of the hemp- 
agrimony, and noting two or three likely looking places, visited 
these later in the evening and was rewarded by a specimen of T'oxo- 
campa cracce. This moth does not settle like a butterfly, with 
closed upright wings as I expected, but like a Triphena. I stayed 
three days longer in hopes of taking additional specimens, but saw 
no more. Along the Lynn immense quantities of valerian are found, 
and the cottage-gardens are full.of it. It grows along the cliffs in 
profusion, and this is its natural habitat I conclude. In the day- 
time the agrimony is a tremendous attraction for all kinds of insects. 
Macroglossa stellatarum, the Vanesside, Theclas, and many other 
lepidopterous insects I saw, as well as Hymenoptera, etc., in quan- 
tities. 

On leaving Lynmouth I was told I should have a three-mile 
walk up Countessbury Hill before I could mount my cycle, but by 
the aid of my 50-inch Pedersen gear I only had to push my machine 
for about one mile. The road continues undulating for some distance 
just skirting Exmoor until one reaches Minehead, where the coast is 
very flat. The Exeter route was now followed, passing the quaint 
little town of Dunster. The road winds along the valleys, and is 
practically downhill to Exeter. I stopped a night at Star Cross, but 
Dawlish Warren, like Deal and so many of our collecting-grounds, is 
being ruined by golfers; besides this, a railway-station has been 
built there, and numerous bungalows, so that there is not much 
ground left from an entomological point of view. 

I did some hedge-beating one afternoon in hopes of disturbing 
Callumorpha hera, when I heard a voice say, ‘‘ You wont get hera 
there, it is too dusty.” I turned round and saw a clergyman in a 
trap with a harmonium; he informed me that he it was who first 
discovered the species there, but, he said, “ hera is not a coast 
insect, it is a garden insect,” and added, ‘‘ you would be more likely to 
find it in the lanes at the back, away from the main road.” This I 
tried, but was not fortunate enough to get a specimen; the only 
thing I netted was a dwarf Pieris rape exactly one inch across the 
wings. Feeling a bit sick of seeing my setting-boards so empty 
I decided to look up my friend Mr. Walker, of Torquay; this I did, 
and he took me to his spot for Lewcania putrescens ; we got a dozen 
each the same night. 

Iwas informed that it was no use trying to catch this insect 
before 10 p.m.; if netted they are so wild that they soon become 
useless as specimens. Mr. Walker put me up to a dodge that was 
entirely new to me. When there are no posts or suitable places to 
treacle, cut a number of flower-heads of the wild carrot, treacle 
these and place them about in hedges and other convenient places. 

We went to a fen out Newton Abbot way one night, but owing 
to a puncture I was not able to be there in time to sugar. I’. paste- 
num is found there; the only thing at all out of the common which 
I got was Noctuwa’uwmbrosa. Leaving Torquay, the next day I cycled 
to Exeter and trained home, after a very enjoyable twenty-three days, 
having seen perhaps the best of Cornwall and Devon. 

I may say my “drying-house” travelled over the two hundred

and sixty odd miles, much of which was literally, “ up hill and down 
dale,” admirably; hardly a pin or brace was loose. Of course I had 
some “packing,” consisting of some of my clothes outside the

Enromonoaican Society or Lonpon.— Wednesday, February 3rd,

Dr. George Blundell Longstaff, M.A., M.D., and Mr. Charles Owen 
Waterhouse, Vice-Presidents for the Session 1909-10.—Mr. Leopold 
Arnon Vidler, of the Camelite Stone House, Rye, was elected a 
Fellow of the Society —The President announced the resignation of 
Professor E. B. Poulton, M.A., D.Se., F.R.S., as a member of the 
Council, and the election of Professor Thomas Hudson Beare, I'.R.S.., 
to serve in his place. — Dr. K. Jordan exhibited some Oriental 
Papilios illustrating polymorphism, and demonstrated that in P. clytia 
and P. dissimilis we have to do with one dimorphic species ; and that 
P. paradoxa and P. caunus also are forms of one species only.—Mr. 
O. E. Janson showed a cockroach and a beetle from the Celebes, 
exhibiting a remarkable case of mimicry; the former apparently an 
undescribed species of Prasoplecta, the latter identified as Colo- 
phora formosa, Crotch_—Mr. W. Parkinson Curtis sent for exhibition 
two specimens, a male and female of Agrotis vestigialis, Rott., from 
Purbeck, Dorset. When working the sandhills he noticed the dead 
female apparently sitting on the grass, and then noticed that she had 
a part of the male appendages attached to her. He then found the 
male, which a common earwig was busily engaged in devouring. 
The earwig, he thought, had attacked the pair 7m cop., but he had 
never noticed a similar case before. Dr. T. A. Chapman felt it 
impossible to accept the conclusion arrived at by the exhibitor with 
regard to the earwig. An earwig would probably not attack a living 
Agrotis ; if it did the Agrotis would undoubtedly repel it successfully. 
He suggested that some accident had happened to the moths, 
whether from some bird or beast there was no evidence to show.— 
Mr. C. O. Waterhouse exhibited a specimen of Acridiwm peregrinum 
from a swarm estimated to number 107,520,000, that visited Las 
Palmas, Grand Canary, in October, 1908; also a dragonfly, Z’ramea 
basilaris, a species which had occurred in such numbers on one 
occasion in Portuguese Congo that the natives mistook them for a 
swarm of locusts.—The Rev. F. D. Morice showed photo-micrographs 
of the “saws” in ten British sawflies-—species of the genus Dolerus. 
After briefly alluding to the specific characters presented by them, to 
certain points in which all alike differed from the ordinary tenon- 
saws employed by carpenters, he invited suggestions which might 
account for these differences. Might it be inferred, he asked, that

the insect’s saw is made to cut, not like the carpenter’s saw, by a 
push, but by a pull, and if so, is it because the latter movement 
involves less risk or damage to these delicate structures through 
bending or breakage ? Again, what is the use of certain extremely 
fine denticulations on the teeth themselves, not at their apices? A 
discussion followed, in which Professor T. Hudson Beare supported, 
on the whole, the hypotheses suggested by the exhibitor. Dr. T. A. 
Chapman, however, was strongly of opinion that the name “saw ”’ 
for these instruments, though well describing their general appear- 
ance, was misapplied as regards their function. They were really 
knives, all their cutting was done during the forward movement, the 
notches being merely a ratchet to hold one “saw” in place whilst the 
other advanced, as they alternately moved.-~H. Rownanp-Brown,

long papers had been given; that the lantern was in frequent use ; 
that both the library and collections were constantly being referred 
to; and that altogether another successful year’s work had been 
recorded. The statement of the Treasurer showed a small balance in 
hand, with hopeful prospects for the coming year. The President, 
Mr. Sich, read the Annual Address, dealing, after the obituary and 
some general remarks upon the Society and the entomological items

antiquity. The following is a list of Officers and Council for the 
ensuing year :—President: A. Sich, F'.H.S.; Vice-Presidents: R. Adkin, 
Ho, W. J. Kaye, Eos: Treasurer :) Ts. W.° Hall, FES. ; 
Librarian: A. W. Dods; Curator: W. West; Hon. Secretaries:

gomery, F.E.S.; H. Main, B.Se., F.H.S.; A. L. Rayward, F.E.S. ; 
R. South, F.H.S.; and A. E. Tonge, F.E.S. Ordinary Meeting —Mr. 
Buckston, on behalf of Mr. Baldwin, exhibited two males of Anthro- 
cera filipendule in cop. with one female; a specimen of Huchelia 
jacobee in which the red markings were very dull in tint; and an 
unusually dwarf example of Polyommatus tcarus.—Mr. Rayward, 
dwarf specimens of P. tcarus, L. arion, Colias hyale, and Huchloé 
cardamines, some captured and some bred, and made some remarks 
on the occurrence of this form of variation.—Hy. J. TuRNER, Hon.

LANCASHIRE AND CHESHIRE ENTOMOoLOGICAL Soctety.—November 
16th, 1908.—Mr. W. Mansbridge, Vice-President, in the* chair.— 
Messrs. Harrison and Main kindly lent their excellent series of lan- 
tern slides, illustrating phases in the development of various inter- 
esting species of Lepidoptera and protective resemblance to resting 
surface, some very striking instances of this latter being shown. Mr. 
Taylor, of Bolton, also sent his series of slides, chiefly of Lepido- 
ptera in their natural surroundings, and some slides of Lepidoptera 
taken by the Lumiére direct colour process. Dr¢ Cotton, as well, 
showed photographs by the Lumiére process of Lepidoptera and 
views in the gardens at Southport.—Mr. F. N. Pierce brought the 
long series of Hydrecia nictitans, paludis, lucens, and all the known 
specimens of H. crinanensis, being the material with which he, in col- 
laboration with the Rev. C. R. N. Burrows, of Mucking, Essex, had 
worked out the specific distinctness of the four species by a study of 
the genitalia. Mr. Pierce described the differences of the genital 
appendages, and illustrated his remarks with a series of excellent 
photographs; he further pointed out how, without destroying the 
moth as a cabinet specimen, the species could be examined and 
recognized. 

December 21st, 1908.—This was the Annual Meeting of the 
Society, held at the Royal Institution, Colquit Street, Liverpool, Mr. 
William Mansbridge, Vice-President, in the chair, and the following 
gentlemen were unanimously elected as the Council of the Society 
for the ensuing year:—President: 8S. J. Capper, F.H.S.  Vice- 
Presidents: H. iss Corbett, M.R.C.S., Doncaster; Wm. Mansbridge,

Sopp, F.R.Met.8., Wolverhampton ; Wm. Webster, M.R.S.A.I. ; Geo. 
Arnold, F.E.8.; Wm. Mallinson. Mr. Oscar Whittaker read a paper 
entitled ‘‘A Preliminary Catalogue of the Hemiptera-Homoptera of 
Lancashire and Cheshire,” and additions to ‘A Preliminary Cata- 
logue of the Hemiptera-Heteroptera of Lancashire and Cheshire.” 
—Mr. George Arnold, F.E.S., read a paper entitled ‘‘ Additions to 
the List of Hymenoptera of Lancashire and Cheshire,” and exhibited 
the various species enumerated. Mr. Oscar Whittaker enumerated 
specimens of Stenocephalus agilis and Corixa affinis, recently added 
to the local list of Heteroptera.—Mr. F. N. Pierce exhibited a short 
series of Abraxas grossulariata, and remarked on the small range of 
variation shown by these specimens during the season of 1908.— 
Mr. C. B. Williams exhibited a number of species of Lepidoptera 
from Cambridge, including Himera pennaria, one brownish female 
and one male irrorated with fuscous. Asteroscopus sphinx; a nice 
series. Crdaria miata. Xylina ornithopus, and from Denbighshire, 
North Wales. Pola chi, a nice series of the typical form. Cloantha 
solidaginis, a nice series, closely agreeing with the West Riding form 
in darkness of coloration. Mr. Williams also announced that a 
specimen of Acherontia atropos had been captured in Birkenhead on 
the 7th November last.—Mr. HE. J. B. Sopp sent for exhibition a 
specimen of the cricket Gryllus bumaculatus, which was found at the 
Liverpool Docks in a fruit cargo from Spain. 

January 18th, 1909.—Meeting held at the Royal Institution, 
Colquit Street, Liverpool, Mr. C. E. Stott, Vice-President, in the 
chair.—Mr. W. Mansbridge, F.E.S8., contributed a paper entitled 
‘‘Micro-Lepidoptera in Lancashire in 1907-8.” The author gave 
short notes on the habits, occurrence, and variation in the case of 
insects freshly recorded by himself during the period mentioned, 
and exhibited most of the species thus dealt with. Pedisca nevana 
and P. geminana were bred last season from holly and bilberry respec- 
tively; the genitalia of these were exhibited under the microscope 
by Mr. F. N. Pierce, but no difference between them could be 
observed, excepting the loss of certain fugitive hair-tufts by P. gem- 
nana. The list given by Mr. Mansbridge included three species new 
to the published lists—Mr. F. N. Pierce showed a series of the 
Carnende group of the Agrotidee, including a small test collection 
sent him by the Rey. C. R. N. Burrows, which had passed through 
the hands of several experts, along with theircomments. Mr. Pierce 
stated that he had now been able to differentiate with perfect clear- 
ness and consistency, by means of the genitalia, four of the species 
in this group, namely, cursoria, nigricans, obelisca, and tritictt and 
aquilina. He also showed the genitalia of two specimens, and the 
wing portions of one of them, which he believed would ultimately 
prove either an unrecognized species or the true aquilina. Mr. 
Pierce illustrated his remarks by preparations shown under the

microscope.— Mr. Stott exhibited a fine specimen of A. atropos, 
captured by Mr. 8. Redford of Fleetwood, at electric light on Fleet- 
wood promenade.—Mr. W. A. Tyerman brought a small collection 
of Lepidoptera, taken in the vicinity of Hong-Kong, which included 
Attacus atlas, Papilio paris, and many other showy species.— Mv. J. J. 
Richardson showed Peronea mixtana from Bidston Hill, Birkenhead.

formis and its parasites Bracon variator and Meniscus penvplator ; also 
stems of Viburnum lantana, showing various phases of larval borings, 
and the cap formed by the larva over the hole through which the 
imago ultimately emerges.—Dr. G. G. C. Hodgson, Argynnis selene, 
East Sussex, June, 1908, one showing a melanic tendency on margi- 
nal area of wings; another with similar tendency on basal half of 
wings; while a third specimen had the marginal half of the wings 
clouded with black broken up by fulvous dashes; in the latter speci- 
men the under side was also abnormal.

RECENT LITERATURE. 


A Natural History of the British Butterflies, their World-wide Varia- 
tron and Geographical Distribution. A Text-book for Students 
and Collectors. By J. W. Tutt, F.E.S. Vol. ii. London: 
Elliot Stock. 1908. 


‘““Popuntar” books upon “ British Butterflies,’ turned out from 
the press at frequent intervals, with one or two notable exceptions, 
continue to repeat the errors of their predecessors, being no more 
than compilations, and destitute of original observations in any form 
or shape. Mr. Tutt, at all events, leaves no excuse for this particular 
class of vicarious writing and its worst absurdities, while the resump- 
tion of his ‘Natural History of British Butterflies’ will be welcomed 
by all who are able to appreciate the value of a comprehensive work 
upon a subject which has hitherto been treated by too many writers 
in a purely imitative spirit. The completion of the second volume, 
also, must have given food for reflection to a great many entomolo- 
gists who have been put in possession, probably for the first time, of 
the real facts connected with the life-histories of the species enume- 
rated. ‘To none of us, perhaps, would it have seemed possible to 
collect and fill four hundred closely printed pages of demy octavo 
with details of our five “Hairstreaks,”’ and a single “ Blue,” their 
varieties, aberrations, and congeners, and this chiefly the harvest of 
original observation. But this is what Mr. Tutt has done for us, to 
say nothing of the chapters devoted to hybernation and estivation, 


. RECENT LITERATURE. i 
and the gregarious and family habits in butterfly larvae. The body of 
volume ii., however, is given over to the British Ruralines (Thec- 
line) and Celastrina (Cyaniris) argiolus, with which most collectors 
are familiar enough in the imago state, and a first result of detailed 
attention to their earlier stages confirms the view that the hetero- 
geneous classifications of previous authors—notably of Staudinger— 
can no longer be justified on a scientific basis. True, Mr. Tutt in- 
dulges in a kind of nomenclature that the older school will scarcely 
admire, and though his generic prefix for w-albwn—Hdwardsta—is 
perforce superseded by Chattendenia in the pages containing ‘“ Corri- 
genda,” the further transformation will not reconcile sticklers for 
form and euphony. It remains for an Entomological Congress of the 
future, conducted on international lines, to give finality to such 
things. Meanwhile Mr. Tutt makes it abundantly clear that some of 
the ‘‘ Linnean shibboleths”’ will have to be discarded as the natural 
consequence of the wider knowledge attained in no small degree by his 
own indefatigable patience and industry, although, as urged in his pre- 
face, we owe a first debt of gratitude to Scudder in this respect for light 
and leading on the right way—that is to say, in educating us to 
recognize the importance of observing the living object as compared 
with museum and cabinet research, which chiefly concerns itself 
with cataloguing and orderly arrangement, in accordance with con- 
vention and convenience, rather than scientific accuracy. 

But, while Mr. Tutt has provided the biological student who 
desires to approach the subject in a serious spirit with much solid 
material, he expresses himself in language which can be understood 
and enjoyed by that larger audience to whom natural history appeals 
as no more than a pleasant holiday for the mind. That, in our 
opinion, is the charm of Mr. Tutt’s writing. An experienced and 
keen worker in the field, he is careful to avoid the dry-as-dust 
phraseology and treatment which so often discourages and repels ; 
he is not above the inclusion of those ‘purple patches’? which give 
colour and variety to highly technical subjects; into the library he 
imports the genial gleam of woodland, down, and heath, with which 
our interesting butterfly fauna is associated. If anything, the 
sections which include locality and habitat are treated too diffusely 
in the case of common insects, and some quite unnecessary repetitions 
might have been avoided. But in the case of our rarer species, for 
good and obvious reasons, we are not sorry that county records are 
often vague and of ancient date. Those who are in the field for 
purely scientific purposes will never, we imagine, have the least 
difficulty in getting such information as they require for legitimate 
purposes from their friends and colleagues. 

Again, there is a refreshing absence of insularity throughout 
these pages. Assisted materially by the discoveries of Dr. Chapman, 
Mr. Bethune-Baker, and others, Mr. Tutt is able to announce even in 
this single volume the identity of several ranked species, especially 
in the wide-ranging genus Celastrina (Cyanirss) ; while, in the parts 
of volume iii. already to hand, he has established a similar state of 
things in the several forms of Hveres, hitherto separated as distinct 
in the Nearctic and Palearctic regions. With the admirable photo- 
micrographic plates by Mr. F. Noad Clark, and Mr. H. Main, before us, 


78 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


we can gather from the illustrations of the complex structures of ova, 
larvee, pup, and imagines thus revealed, precisely how these results 
have been attained. We are also able to follow the author’s chain of 
reasoning as it leads up to the establishment of species based upon 
sound scientific differentiation, discarding mere superficial marking of 
the wings and the external similitude of one particular stage of 
development, and drawing final conclusions from a review made of the 
whole life-history of each individual, now presented in complete 
sequence for the first time. The discovery of separation of species by 
the character of their appendages knocked on the head some old- 
established theories as to what constituted a species in Lepidoptera. 
Mr. Tutt goes further, and in the process of assigning these one or 
two species their proper place in the scheme of butterfly classification 
carries his anatomical investigations far beyond anything of the kind 
already attempted. We feel quite sure, therefore, that whatever 
affinities exist, and whatever further light may be thrown on this 
difficult subject, no conscientious systematist will ever again return to 
the easy methods complacently accepted by British and Continental 
authors. Mr. Tutt, we are certain, would be the first to acknowledge 
how large a share of the credit for this is due to those who have 
exerted themselves for him, and under his instructions. Yet we 
would remind our readers that it is only by cordial co-operation 
among British lepidopterists, whether engaged with biological pro- 
blems or with the pleasures of field natural history, that this classic 
series can ever be completed. We have, indeed, comparatively few 
British butterflies, but those we have offer a wide field for research, 
still in many cases wholly unexplored. Those who are endeavouring 
to do this pioneer work ought to be encouraged, and we trust that 
the public libraries, and Natural History Societies throughout the 
United Kingdom will come forward to support an enterprise which 
should not be left to private subscription only. 3

Catalogue Systématique et Biologique des Hyménoptéres de France. 
Par JULES DE GAULLE, Membre de la Société Entomologique 
de France. Pp. 171. With Introduction and Index of Genera, 
Plant-names, and Host-names. Paris: Paul Klincksieck, 3, 
Rue Corneille. 1908. [Extrait de la ‘Feuille des Jeunes 
Naturalistes,’ 1906-8. ] 


As the author of the present work very truly says, it certainly is 
of very considerable use to supplant the hymenopterous ‘ Catalogue’ 
published by Dours in 1874 by a fresh one, bringing up to date in a 
concise form all that has been done in France upon the Hymenoptera 
during the past quarter ofa century. And, indeed, when we compare 
the two, we get as good a conspectus as is anywhere obtainable of 
what the last twenty-five years has produced. Our friend M. de 
Gaulle pretends to no novel classification, but freely avows that he 
follows Dalla Torre, except where the latter has been elaborated by 
the subsequent works of André, Berthoumieu, Rev. T. A. Marshall, 
Du Buysson, the late Pastor Konow, and, unfortunately, of Kieffer. 
Perhaps it had been better in a few instances, such as the specific 


RECENT LITERATURE. 79 


ingredients of the genera Barichnewmon and Cratichnewmon which 
are much intermingled, if he had not so closely followed the second 
author cited, and a great many of Forster’s genera, given by Dalla 
Torre, are most unnatural ones; but it is a systematist’s duty to 
include all the divisions erected, though subsequent writers are 
fortunately at liberty to ignore them, if found invalid. Particularly 
in the Pezomachoid subgenera is this the case, since these sections 
are founded entirely upon alar development, of no stability in these 
groups; and one is led to think Pezomachus itself but poorly repre- 
sented by thirty-four species, though many more can now be added, 
since we have ourself seen several species in M. de Gaulle’s collection, 
not herein included. The grouping of the Pimplini genera is some- 
what novel, though it is in no way to be condemned; and many of 
those among the Mesoleptini might have been dispensed with to 
greater advantage, especially the Forsteran, though that author’s 
really useful Alloplasta has not been employed for Meniscus murinus, 
Gravy. The Braconids follow Marshall’s arrangement in André’s 
great work, with various doubtful improvements from Szeplegeti in 
‘Genera Insectorum.’ The listis a full one, though itis surprising to 
find but forty-two species of Apanteles enumerated: seventy-three are 
British. France has evidently paid a great deal more attention to her 
Chalcidide than Britain of late. The catalogue is not extensive, though 
very instructive, comparing favourably with that of our own species 
recently presented for publication to the Entomological Society of 
London by Mr. Claude Morley, which comprises over fourteen hundred 
species. It is, however, quite otherwise with the Chrysids, Ants, 
and, in fact, all the Aculeata ; and one is led to speculate upon our 
insular dearth of these things. The author has conferred one real 
boon upon all systematists in distinctly intimating such “ species” as 
are mere MS. names, both in Dours’ ‘ Catalogue’ and in Dr. Giraud’s 
very excellent ‘Liste des éclosions d’Insectes” (Ann. Soc. Fr. 1877, 
pp. 397-436). Another is the addition of food-plants in the phyto- 
phagous, and host-names in the parasitic, species; as well as the 
establishment of the synonymy of names in Fourcroy’s ‘ Entomologia 
Parisiensis’ and De Fonscolombe’s ‘ Ichneumonologie Provincale’ of 
1847 to 1854. M. de Gaulle, in a post-scriptum, requests that all 
additions to the French fauna and suggestions for the good of the 
Catalogue be sent him. We can do no more than return our thanks 
for an exceedingly valuable and laborious list, and venture to note 
that there is no summary of the exact number of species in the 
various families, subfamilies, and tribes enumerated. The total is 
said to approximate five thousand species, one comparing most 
favourably with the two thousand six hundred of the old Catalogue, 
though the total is suspected of reaching eight thousand when full 
investigation of France’s Hymenoptera has been achieved.

Tue third volume of Mr. Morley’s valuable work on our parasitic 
flies was published at the end of November last; it deals with the 
third great subfamily, the Pimpline, which, as*the author states, is 
probably better known than any of the others on account of the 
large size and interesting economy of many of the species belonging 
to it. Two hundred and eleven species are included in the sub- 
family, and these are divided up into the following five tribes :— 

Xoridides (8 genera, 15 species); Pimplides (12 genera, 106 
species); Lissonotides (9 genera, 62 species) ; Aczenitides (8 genera, 
13 species); and Banchides (2 genera, 15 species). 

The Xoridides prey chiefly on wood-feeding Coleoptera and 
Hymenoptera. The majority of the Pimplides affect lepidopterous 
or hymenopterous larvee—at least one attacks the nest of the mason 
wasp, and a few destroy spiders or their eggs. Lissonotides are 
mainly associated with Lepidoptera, and rarely with Coleoptera. Of 
the Aczenitides the hosts are but little known, and so far as has been 
ascertained seem to be parasitic, as are the Banchides, on Lepido- 

tera. 

F The present volume is in every way quite up to the standard 
of the first one, which we had the pleasure of noticing some five 
years ago (Entom. xxxyvii. p. 52). As we then remarked, parasitical 
flies are well known to the rearer of Lepidoptera. How few of us, 
however, seem to recognize the possibility of the destroyer of our 
hopes being some rare or little-known species of ichneumon.

FIVE WEEKS IN THE VOSGES. 
By A. EK. Gisss, F.L.S8. 
(Puate IIT.) 


WHEN travelling down the Rhine Valley from Strassburg to 
Mulhousen a few years ago, I noticed from the carriage window 
on the right the long line of castle-crowned peaks of the ‘ blue 
Alsatian mountains,” a delightful looking country which appear- 
ed to be well worth a visit, and I determined on some future 
occasion to explore this tempting region. These hills form the 
Vosges range of Alsace and Lorraine, on the border-land of 
France and Germany, and across their highest peaks runs the 
boundary line, the scientific frontier which Bismark insisted on 
at the close of the war of 1870. In turning over in my mind 
last winter possible schemes for an entomological holiday on the 
Continent, not so remote from home as to make the journey too 
exhausting for the younger members of the party, 1 thought of 
resolves made in bygone days. So we made a hasty tour at 
‘Easter, when the hills were covered with snow and the cold was 
intense, to spy out the land, and to find a comfortable hotel for 
a few weeks’ sojourn, in a centre which appeared promising 
from an entomological as well as a scenic point of view, with the 
result that we selected the village of St. Maurice-sur-Moselle 
at the south-west corner of the range, on French territory, as 
our headquarters, a choice which we afterwards found no reason 
to regret. St. Maurice is an industrial village of about three 
thousand inhabitants, situated at an altitude of 1824 ft. above 
sea-level, and is reached from Paris by way of Nancy and Epinal. 
Arriving in the evening of June 27th we found comfortable 
rooms had been reserved for us in the Hotel de la Gare, where 
Mons. Cuny, the landlord, and his good wife proved most assidu- 
ous and attentive. The next morning broke delightfully and we 
were astir betimes. While breakfast was being prepared under 
the shade of the lime tree, whose fragrant blossoms were being 
picked to be dried to mix with the tea, or what passes for tea in

eastern France, we got our first experiences with the butterflies 
of the region, by capturing Pararge mera and Aporia crategi 
which were flying in the hotel garden. Both were worn, the 
latter especially having seen its best days, though dilapidated 
females were to be met with for several weeks after this date; 
in fact the insect was on the wing during the whole time we were 
at St. Maurice. Mr. P.J. Barraud had travelled with us from 
Paris and remained for about a fortnight, during which time we 
made many pleasant excursions together. After breakfast we 
set out to explore the hills at the back of the hotel. Hardly had 
we crossed the little footbridge which spans the Moselle than I 
took a very fresh Carcharodus althe@, the only one seen during 
our visit. A number of specimens of Rusticus argus (egon) were 
secured, a species which proved to be common in the district. 
On a piece of waste ground near by and in the meadows which 
were being mowed, Hrebia stygne was flying, but was already 
getting over, and we found it difficult to pick out good specimens. 
Proceeding up the mountain side and capturing an occasional 
Melitea athaha and M. parthenie, we saw a bigger fritillary 
which Mr. Barraud captured. It proved to be Argynnis niobe 
var. eris, and higher up the hill several others were taken. 
Melanargia galatea was well represented and in excellent condi- 
tion, and the same may be said for Lycena arion, some boldly- 
marked forms of which were obtained during our stay in the 
Vosges. Several beautiful specimens of Chrysophanus alciphron 
(type) rewarded a rough scramble. In the afternoon we again 
crossed the river and worked lower down the valley. Near the 
bridge my companion suddenly plunged into the brambles on the 
river bank and returned with a beautiful specimen of Limenitis 
camilla in his net, and a few minutes afterwards two others fell 
to my lot. Polygonia c-album was sporting in the bushes by the 
roadside, and an amorous pair allowed themselves to be caught 
without much trouble. In a bushy place on the edge of a wood 
Argynnis adippe was to be seen in first-class order. On the 
whole our first day’s bag was a most encouraging one. Tempted 
by our successes we again visited the same hillside the next morn- 
ing, but working up to a higher level, spending most of the time 
on the margin of the fir forest which crowned the summit of the 
mountain. On the way up, when climbing a steep grassy 
declivity, Mr. Barraud netted a specimen of Papilio podalirius, 
but it escaped, and although it came my way I had no better 
luck. This was unfortunate, as we did not again see this attrac- 
tive species. The four larger Argynnids—paphia, aglaia, adippe 
(with its var. cleodora) and niobe (mostly var. eris)—were 
abundant; a few Brenthis selene were seen; the Melitwas were 
athalia, dictynna and parthenie, while Lycena arion flew about 
everywhere. After lunch we determined to try our fortunes on 
the opposite side of the valley. On the high road Pararge mera

was much in evidence, sunning itself on the walls and rocks, 
but it was so battered and torn that it was not possible to find 
specimens of cabinet rank, and we had to defer the capture of a 
series until we visited the summits of the mountains, where it 
was in more presentable condition. Jssoria lathonia, after the 
manner of its kind, was seen to settle on the dusty road and 
fell a prey to the net. Crossing some marshy meadows below 
the forester’s house on the Plain du Canon, Brenthis ino was 
found flying among the more plentiful Melitea athalia. Hugonia 
polychloros was first taken on June 29th, and July Ist 
we visited the lower slopes of the Ballon de Servance, 
a locality which proved afterwards to be our most prolific 
hunting-ground. On an uncultivated piece of hillside, where the 
children were busy picking whortleberries, we first made 
acquaintance with Hrebia ligea, each of us catching two of 
them. This insect was subsequently found flying in sunny 
places at all elevations above the meadows which extend up to 
the forest zone, and also on the open summits of the higher 
mountains. 

In the southern section of the Vosges are found the most 
lofty peaks in the range, rising to a height of four or five thou- 
sand feet, the average altitude of the hills being about three 
thousand feet. These high points are called Ballons. Towering 
above St. Maurice are two of the most important of these forest- 
clad heights. The huge granitic mass of the Ballon de Servance, 
projecting into the valley and forcing the Moselle to turn north 
westwards almost at a right angle, rises boldly above the village 
and forms a watershed, the drainage on the one side being gener- 
ally northwards through the Moselle and other tributaries of the 
Rhine into the North Sea, while on the opposite side of the 
divide the streams flow southward tothe Mediterranean. There 
are forests of beech and fir on the slopes, and above them 
rise the rounded grassy summits almost bare of trees or bushes, 
the haunt of Hrebia stygne and HE. ligea. On July 2nd we took 
advantage of a motor car which runs from the station to the 
hotel near the summit of the Ballon d’Alsace. Arriving soon 
after ten we started to climb to the highest point, across which 
runs the frontier line. Hundreds of H. stygne, mostly in first- 
class condition, were flying in the grass despite the strong wind 
which was blowing, and a very good series was soon secured. A 
fine male iris, seudding along with the wind at a great pace, was 
taken by me on the French side of’ the frontier line, and while I 
was busy with it Mr. Barraud took a fresh female of Limenitis 
popult var. tremule. Subsequently I chased what I believed to 
be L. populi at Charmes on July 30th, but as I did not succeed 
in catching it that locality must not be recorded. After lunch 
the wind dropped a little, and we spent some time in a sheltered

valley, where on the sides of a streamlet, Brenthis selene, appar- 
ently only recently out of the chrysalis, and one rather worn 
B. euphrosyne were sporting among the wild flowers, while 
Limenitis camilla was netted flying round a bush. Returning to 
the hotel for lunch several fresh specimens of Gonepteryx rhamni 
and some bright Vanessa urtice were secured. I did not again 
visit the summit of the Ballon d’Alsace until July 26th, by which 
time Hrebia stygne had knocked itself to pieces, and EH. ligea had 
taken its place as the most abundant butterfly. On this occasion 
a freshly-emerged female Parnassius apollo was found at rest on 
a flower-head on a steep slope just below the statue to the 
Virgin, which has been erected on the highest point. On July 
4th, Mr. Barraud and I paid a visit to Wesserling, a German 
town, which was reached by coach from Bussang at the head of 
the St. Maurice valley. At the top of the col, at an altitude of 
2410 ft., the road passes through a tunnel, and we emerge in 
German territory. A characteristic feature of the Vosges range 
is that on the western slope the descent to the level of the plains 
is gradual, whereas on the eastern side the declivity is very 
abrupt. This is well seen on the ride to Wesserling, and we 
ran quickly down the steep gradients to our destination. We 
had only about a hour’s collecting at Wesserling, but it proved 
to be very remunerative. Crossing the railway near the station 
we ascended a wooded hill and were soon busy. Never, I think, 
have I seen such an abundance of butterflies, especially of Argyn- 
nis paphia, which was present in countless numbers on every 
bramble bush. Here we got ten specimens of Brenthis daphne, of 
which Mr. Barraud had met with a single example at St. Maurice 
on July 8rd. L. camilla, I. lathonia, A. adippe and its var. cleodoxa, 
M. didyma, and M. galatea were among the species taken. We 
were experiencing perfect weather, and the next day we deter- 
mined to ascend the Ballon de Servance. ‘The path led past the 
spot where a few days before we had discovered LH. ligea and 
close by Mr. Barraud found Hipparchia semele, having lower down 
taken the first specimen of the season of Leptosia sinapis. 
Crossing the heathy slope where the commoner blues and 
fritillaries were sporting in the sunshine, the way next traversed 
the dense pine forest, where no sign of winged life was to be 
seen, but after a stiff climb through the gloom we emerged into 
a sunny meadow, where we were soon hard at work taking 
among other things some rather worn specimens of Chrysophanus 
hippothée. Another short walk through the forest brought us 
on to the military road leading to the fort on the summit. A 
flowery space among the young fir trees was spied, which proved 
to be a veritable ‘‘ butterfly corner,’ and where we afterwards 
spent many pleasant moments in the company of Vanessa 10, 
V. urtice, Polygonia c-album, Erebia ligea, E. stygne, Issoria 
lathonia, Pararge mera, Argynnis paphia, A. adippe, A. aglata, 


FIVE WEEKS IN THE VOSGES. 85 


Brenthis ino, Melitea dictynna, M. didyma, M. athalia, &amp;c.— 
more pleasant perhaps for us than for the butterflies. We lingered 
all too long in this attractive spot, for there was still a stiff 
climb to the summit, and the way again led through the forest. 
By the time we had gained the top and were within sight of the 
fort, the sky had clouded over and rain soon began to fall. We 
tramped through the damp grass, turning out Mrebia stygne in 
abundance, but little else, and the weather becoming worse we 
had to seek such shelter as the rocks afforded. However, we 
persevered, and after a time it cleared up sufficiently for us to 
explore a tempting looking valley, into the depths of which we 
scrambled, down precipitous slopes, pushing our way through 
the bushes, and at last arriving at the swampy ground at 
bottom, which had allured us to the venturesome descent. Our 
exertions were, however, without reward, for there was nothing 
to be found worth catching, and having rested long enough to eat 
our lunch and feast on the wild fruits, we succeeded in finding 
a woodman’s path which led us to the summit again. The walk 
back to St. Maurice yielded nothing fresh, but we had done a 
good day’s work and added three species to our list—L. sinapis, 
P. semele, and V. io. On the following morning a visit was paid 
to the Vallée des Charbonniers, where the bag included a very nice 
pale aberration of I. lathonia, and in the afternoon I climbed the 
hill at the back of the hotel and found Brenthis dia sporting in 
considerable numbers among the bracken, enjoying the last 
brief moments of sunshine before the Monarch of the Day sank 
behind the mountain and left the hillside in shadow. 

On Tuesday, July 7th, we decided to go a little further afield, 
and leaving St. Maurice by the seven o’clock train arrived about 
an hour later at Remiremont, whence a steam tramway runs 
among the hills to Gerardmer. Our destination was Le Tholy, 
in the valley of the Cleurie. It is a small village with a cotton 
mill, and is a great centre of the cheese-making industry. There 
is a little hotel on the mountain above the station, and on our 
way up a magnificent female Limenitis camilla, surely one of the 
loveliest of insects, was secured. A few minutes later Ceno- 
nympha arcana was taken at rest on a blossom, and on the edge 
of a piece of woodland Mr. Barraud netted a male Apatura iris. 
Another record for the day was Thecla ilicis var. cerrt, of which 
some four or five worn specimens appeared. After lunch a walk 
on the other side of the valley resulted in two more L. camilla, 
and among less noteworthy things a dwarf Melanargia galatea, 
but more curious still was a minute Lycena arion, measuring 
only twenty-eight mm., which Mr. Barraud captured.

FOUR NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS ERETMA- 
PODITES (Tueopatp) FROM ASHANTI. 


By W. M. Granam, M.B., 


Director Medical Research Institute, Lagos. 


TueEse four new species of the genus Eretmapodites are forest 
mosquitoes. They frequent shady forest paths where there are 
trees overhead, and where the ground is not quite bare of vegeta- 
tion. They are sometimes found perching on low bushes, but 
are usually nearer the ground. 

Numbers 3 and 4 are the commoner species, and can be found 
almost anywhere in the shady forest from May to January. 

I have reared females of No. 8 from larve taken from a hole 
full of a decoction of dead leaves in the root of a forest tree. I 
ee caught the female adult on the flowers of the wild pine- 
apple. 

All four species, in the ‘resting attitude, carry the third pair 
of legs curved forward over the thorax; I have not seen them 
bite. They were taken at Obuasi and Kumasi. 

Two other species, EH. quinquevittata and EH. austenii, have 
been described by Theobald, and another, LH. inornatus, by New- 
stead, all from Africa. 


A. Pale species; head covered mostly with pavrti- 
coloured flat scales. Prothoracic lobes 
covered with narrow, curved scales. 

1. Hind tarsi of male “paddled,” of female 


normal, black . . otdipodetos, n. sp. 
2. Hind tarsi of male and fone oe last 
two joints white : . lewcopous, n. sp. 


B. Darker species, with more unicoloured flat 
scales on the head. Prothoracic lobes 
covered with flat scales. 

3. Hind tarsi of male feathered, venter of female 


golden . . chrysogaster, n. sp. 
4, Hind tarsi of male normal, venter of female 
black and white. ; h : ; . melanopous, Nn. Sp. 


1, Hretmapodites oidipodeios, NOV. sp. 

3. The head is covered in front with dense parti-coloured (blue 
and white) flat scales, which project between the eyes and clothe the 
sides of the head, and in a triangular area behind with golden, narrow- 
curved and black upright and golden upright forked scales. Six long 
dark bristles project forward between the eyes, and posterior to them 
are three lateral bristles on each side of the head. 

Antenne: Plumose, the verticillate hairs pale brown. The two 
apical segments three times as long as the others. 


Palpi : Thin, acuminate, black, without plumose hairs, shorter 
than proboscis. 


FOUR NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS ERETMAPODITES. 87 


Proboscis: Long, thin, blue-black, curved apically. 

Clypeus: Dark brown, nude. 

Thorax: The mesonotum is covered with narrow-curved scales. 
The ground colour is orange, covered in the greater part by black 
scales. Two parallel narrow bands of golden scales run backwards 
for about three-fourths of the length of the mesonotum, enclosing be- 
tween them a median black band of equal breadth. Behind, the black 
median band is continued to the scutellum by a short band of golden 
scales. Laterally there are two curved bands of golden scales, which 
reach the hind margin just external to the lateral lobes of the scutel- 
lum. An interrupted border of golden scales surrounds the meso- 
notum. Two tufts of long hairs project backwards above the wing- 
joints. 

Scutellum: The central lobe is covered with blue and white 
parti-coloured flat scales, almost surrounded by purple flat scales, and 
on the edge are four long bristles and five smaller ones. The lateral 
lobes are covered with golden, narrow-curved and black, narrow- 
curved scales, and show three long bristles and some shorter ones. 

Pleurz: The pleura is a pale golden’ colour, with two closely 
approximated spots of blue and white flat scales below the wing- 
point, one on the mesopleura and one on the metapleura, with a third 
smaller spot lower down on the mesopleura. The prothoracic lobes 
are covered with narrow-curved, golden and a few black scales. 
There are some bristles on the edge, and below on the expanded tip of 
the prosternum there is a patch of blue and white flat scales. 

Halteres: Base pale cream, part of the stalk and the knob covered 
with blue-black scales. 

Metanotum: A dark golden colour, with five hairs and a few 
golden, narrow-curved scales at the apex. 

Abdomen: A velvety black, with purple reflections, the venter 
banded with basal white bands, which become oblique laterally and 
become apical on the sixth segment. There is a dorsal white band 
on the seventh segment. The abdomen is compressed laterally and 
expanded posteriorly. 

Legs: A purple-black, with narrow apical pale bands on the 
femora of the third pair. The hind tarsi are of abnormal form and 
densely plumed. The fourth segment is at right angles to the third 
segment, and is curved. The fifth segment is as long as the fourth, 
and nearly straight. Long pale brown hairs hang from the distal 
extremity of the third segment, and the fourth and fifth segments are 
feathered on both sides with long pale brown hairs, those on the 
fourth being almost at right angles to those on the fifth segment. 

Ungues: I have not been able to spare a male for dissection. 

Wings: Clothed along the costa with blue-black flat scales, with 
a metallic lustre, and elsewhere with dark-ribbed Trichoprosopon-like 
scales. The first submarginal cell is narrower and one-third of its 
length longer than the second posterior cell. The stem of the first 
submarginal more than half the length of the cell. The super- 
numerary and mid cross-veins are close together, and the posterior 
cross-vein about its own length nearer the base of the wing. The 
sixth vein turns at right angles to the costa just before its termination. 
There are a few blunt flat scales on the alule. 


88 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Genitalia: The basal lobes are a long oval, with long curved 
claspers without terminal articulated spines, and covered on the basal 
half with flat scales, and on the distal half with some bristles. Very 
long, golden, stiff hairs clothe the basal lobes and project between 
them. I have not had material for a dissection. 

Length: 4 mm. 

?. Head as in male. Antenne less plumose. Palpi: Rather 
long, densely scaled, acuminate, black. Proboscis, thorax, meta- 
notum: As in male. 

Abdomen: The dorsum and sides are a velvety black, with 
broad oblique lateral white bands, basal on the proximal segments 
and apical on the sixth segment. The venter is pale gold, with 
apical black bands on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seg- 
ments. 

Legs: As in male, but the pale band on the hind femora is white. 
The hind tarsi are of normal form. 

Wings: As in male. First submarginal one-third longer than 
second posterior, and stem of first submarginal half the length of the 
cell. Cross-veins as in male.

on the seventh segment, but do not meet in the middle line dorsally. 
There are golden ventral spots on the sixth and seventh segments. 
Abdomen is compressed laterally and flattened and expanded towards 
the extremity. 

Legs: As in No. 1, but the two last segments of the tarsi are pure 
white and of normal form. 

Wings: Colour and scales very similar to those of No.1. First 
submarginal cell one-third of its length longer than the second 
posterior cell. The stem of the first submarginal more than half as 
long as the cell. All these cross-veins are close together. Sixth vein 
turns at right angles to costa at its extremity. 

Genitalia: Externally very similar to No. 1. 

Length: 4 mm.

bands on the fourth, fifth, and sixth segments. The dorsum and 
sides are velvety black, with oblique white basal lateral bands, be- 
coming apical on the sixth and seventh segments. Abdomen 
narrowed towards its extremity. Legs and tarsi: Asin male. 

Wings: First submarginal cell more than one-third of its length 
longer than the second posterior. The stem of the first submarginal

There is nothing, apparently, entomological in the “ Bio- 
logical Investigation of the Athabaska-Mackenzie Region,” but 
the work will be indispensable to any entomologist studying the 
region, whose physical geography, life-zones, vertebrata, botany, 
and history are exhaustively considered (7), a bibliography 
and index being added. It is supplementary to the previous 
report on the Hudson Bay Region (1902, North American Fauna, 
no. 22). 

The Twenty-third New York Report is the buikiest of the 
series, and contains much matter of interest and importance to 
the systematist as well as to the biologist (5). The principal 
paper is Needham’s ‘‘ Report on the Aquatic Work done during 
1905” (pp. 156-248, text figs. 2-16, pls. 4-82, and 2 text maps), 
containing a new classification of the Tipulide; there are also 
extensive notes on the Odonata. Among the other contributions 
are Chadwick’s ‘‘ Catalogue of the Phytoptid Galls of North 
America’ (pp. 118-55) ; O. S. Thomson’s ‘“‘ Discussion of the 
Male Genitalia in Odonata” (pp. 249-63, text figs. 17-28) ; and 
Felt’s ‘‘ Further Work on the Cecidomyiide” (pp. 286-422, text 
figs. 29-49, pls. 83-44). 

Reuter has treated in the fullest manner the Palearctic 
Hemiptera of the Conifere (1). The enumeration and dis- 
cussion of the species are accompanied by a very extensive 
bibliography. Guilbeau (4) has discussed the origin of froth in 
Cercopid nymphs. He says that the secretion is made up from 
two sources. The fluid portion is the anal secretion into which 
the insect by means of the caudal appendages introduces nume- 
rous air-bubbles; the glands of Batelli secrete a mucilaginous 
substance, which, added to the former, renders it viscous, and 
causes the retention of the air-bubbles. Distant (2) has com- 
pleted his preliminary account of the Indo-Ceylonese Hemiptera. 
The work will be useful for the two hundred and eighty-two 
figures, many of the genera being figured for the first time.

these aphids are also Kuropean. 

Auriyilius (11) and Wahlgren (13 &amp; 14) have treated of certain 
Swedish insect groups; their papers should be of considerable 
interest to British workers. 

The titles of the other papers enumerated are self-explanatory

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW CICADA FROM CENTRAL 
CHINA. 


By W. L. Disrant. 


Fam. CICADIDA. 
Subfam. Ganina. 
Taona, gen. nov. 


Head, including eyes, about as wide as base of mesonotum and 
as long as pronotum, the front not obliquely deflected but horizontally 
produced in front of and a little below the anterior margin of the 
vertex; ocelli somewhat close together near middle of vertex ; face 
prominent, somewhat compressed, strongly transversely ridged ; 
clypeus strongly compressed and reaching the anterior coxe ; pro- 
notum about as long as mesonotum, its lateral margins nearly 
straight; rostrum reaching the posterior cox; anterior femora 
strongly spined beneath; tegmina and wings opaque, tegmina with 
their greatest breadth more than one-third their length, apical areas 
eight, the apical margin oblique, the apex subangulate. 


Intermediate between Geana and Balinta, allied to the first 
by the broader tegmina, but differing by the shorter head, which 
allies it to Balinta, from which, however, it is separated by the 
short and broad tegmina, and the non-deflected head in front of 
eyes; the compressed face somewhat straightly continued to 
clypeus is also distinctive. Ihave not seen a male specimen, so 
cannot describe the opercula. 


Taona versicolor, sp. 0. 


?. Head, pronotum, mesonotum, head beneath, sternum, legs 
and tegmina virescent; eyes, apices of tibize, tarsi and costal mem- 
brane of tegmina more or less pale testaceous-brown, the veins on 
basal area of tegmina fuscous-brown; abdomen bright reddish- 
ochraceous; wings cretaceous-white, opaque, the venation dull 
ochraceous; body above and beneath more or less palely pilose ; 
posterior femora with two long strong spines beneath and a shorter 
and more obtuse spine just in front of the anterior spine; structural 
characters as in generic diagnosis.

NEW. AMERICAN BEES.—VIII. 
By T. D. A. CockERELL. 


Nomada vexator, n. sp. 


?. Length, 7 to 8 mm.; ferruginous red; head, thorax, and 
legs marked (not heavily) with black, but with no yellow; abdomen 
shining light ferruginous, with no black except three spots (one basal 
and two lateral) on first segment, and even these sometimes hardly 
developed ; second abdominal segment with a variable but always 
large cream-coloured patch on each side; third segment with much 
smaller spots, sometimes reduced to dots ; fourth with two transverse 
subdorsal spots, sometimes absent; fifth with a pair of large spots, 
usually confluent; apex with a rather narrow band of silvery tomen- 
tum. Antenne entirely clear ferruginous, third joint a little longer 
than fourth, flagellum rather thick; mandibles simple ; first joint of 
labial palpi much longer than the other three united ; middle of face, 
connecting with a large area enclosing ocelli, and hind part of cheeks, 
black ; scutellum strongly bilobed; mesothorax very densely punc- 
tured, with a median black band, broadening anteriorly; metathorax 
with a black band, and its sides with white hair; tegule bright 
ferruginous; wings dusky hyaline, clear subapically and strongly 
dusky at apex; stigma ferruginous, nervures fuscous; b.n. meeting 
t.m.; second s.m. large, receiving the r. n. far beyond its middle; 
third s.m. narrowed greatly above; tibie and tarsi without black, 
but the femora marked with black, especially the hind ones; venter 
of abdomen red without markings. In my table of Rocky Mountain 
Nomada (Bulletin 94, Colo. Exp. Sta.) this runs nearest to N. luteo- 
picta, but differs in the proportions of the antennal joints, and the 
‘pale yellow abdominal markings. The same characters, and the 
venation (b. n. meeting t. m.) readily separate it from N. cymbalarie 
and N. mera, which run to the same point in the table. In many 
respects N. vexator resembles N. accepta, but the abdomen is much 
darker and more copiously ornamented with cream-colour in accepia, 
while the mesothorax is three banded, and there are yellow spots at 
the lower corners of the face. 

3. Length, 7mm.; head and thorax black, without any red ; 
both densely punctured, and with quite abundant white hair, which 
is appressed and bright silvery on face; thorax with no light mark- 
ings except a cream-coloured spot on the tubercles; clypeus with the 
lower half (narrowest in the middle), lateral marks sending linear up- 
ward extensions to level of antenns, scape in front, labrum, and 
mandibles except apex, light yellow; third antennal joint about as 
long as fourth on upper side, but much shorter below ; scape and first 
four joints of flagellum black above, remaining joints showing succes- 
sively decreasing infuscation: legs red, anterior and middle femora 
black basally beneath, hind femora black with the apex red; second 
s.m. narrower than in female, receiving r. n. in middle; abdomen 
marked nearly as in female, but basal half of first segment nearly all 
black, and blackish transverse stains on third and fourth; apical seg- 
ments with thin white pubescence; apical plate very narrow and 


NEW AMERICAN BEES. 93 


pointed, entire; venter red, with black only on first segment. The 
markings of the abdomen are not unlike those of N. gracilis, but the 
apical plate is entirely different. 


Hab. Troublesome, Colorado, alt. 7345 ft., June 9th, 1908 
(S. A. Rohwer). One male and five females, the type being 
one of the latter. 

Nomada wootonella, n. sp. 

3. Asmall species closely related to N. sayz, Robertson, but differ- 
ing as follows:—Head broader, eyes more diverging above; lateral 
face-marks not so large below; eyes pale green; pleura with a dull 
yellowish spot in front; legs light ferruginous, the anterior ones 
largely yellowish, and the others spotted with yellow, the hind femora 
with a brown spot behind near apex; abdomen with the yellow mark- 
ings enlarged, so that the second and third segments have very broad 
bands, narrowed and interrupted in the middle ; apical plate entire, 
or with only a faint trace of the emargination which is so con- 
spicuous in V. sayz. The N. sayz compared is an authentic specimen 
from Robertson. 


Hab. Mesilla Park, New Mexico, April 26th (T. D. A. Cock- 
erell). At flowers of Sophia ochroleuca, Wooton. Named after 
Prof. Wooton, of the New Mexico Agricultural College, who 
described the plant it visits. 


Nomada civilis, Cresson, 1878. 


Cresson described this from nine males collected in Colorado. 
It is very variable, both in size and markings. At Troublesome, 
Colorado, alt. 7345 ft., June 9th, 1908, Mr. 8. A. Rohwer took 
both sexes. The female runs in my table of Rocky Mountain 
Nomada (Bull. 94, Colo. Exper. Sta.) to N. agynia, male, but is 
quite distinct from that species. As is usual in the group to 
which the species belongs, the female N. civilis is very unlike 
the male, agreeing, however, in the very broad face, with the 
orbits diverging above. The following characters of the female 
are distinctive :— 

Lower part of face, including labrum and supraclypeal mark, 
lemon-yellow; orbital margins above middle of face broadly ferru- 
ginous, this continuing over to the cheek, on the lower half or more 
of which it gives way to yellow; scape ordinary, yellow in front, 
antennz otherwise wholly ferruginous, without black or dusky ; 
mesothorax rough, black, with a little red at extreme sides; tegule 
light ferruginous, with a yellow spot in front; tubercles and upper 
margin of prothorax yellow; pleura ferruginous, with a suffused 
yellow patch; scutellum and postscutellum yellow, with reddish 
hair; metathorax black, with a pair of large round light red spots, 
varying to slightly yellowish in the middle; legs clear ferruginous 
red, the apices of the femora and anterior and middle tibize con- 
spicuously marked with yellow ; abdomen bright lemon-yellow, with 
clear ferruginous bands above and below; on the first segment the 
yellow is reduced to a mark (one-third of a band) on each side, and 


94 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


there is a black subbasal median spot; on the second segment the 
yellow is much narrowed in the middle. 


Nomada truttarum, 0. sp. 


3. Length about 8 mm., the abdomen fusiform and rather slen- 
der; belongs to the subgenus Xanthidiwm. Head broad, orbits not 
greatly diverging above; face with appressed silvery hair, not con- 
cealing the surface; mandibles simple; mandibles except apex, 
labrum, clypeus (a black sutural spot on each side), quadrate supra- 
clypeal patch, and large lateral face-marks (filling in the whole area 
between clypeus and eyes, and extending from upper corners of 
clypeus, touching the antennal sockets, to a point some distance 
above antennee) all pale yellow; a narrow yellow stripe, becoming 
reddish, extends up posterior orbital margins, and there is a ferru- 
ginous patch above summit of eye; third antennal joint scarcely 
over half length of fourth ; scape moderately swollen, yellow in front, 
black behind, the junction of the colours reddish ; flagellum stout and 
long, red, with the first five joints strongly blackened above, and the 
third to fifth strongly undulate ; apical joint obtuse; thorax black, 
with the hair all white, especially conspicuous on pleura; scutellum, 
four rather obscure stripes on mesothorax, part of prothorax above, 
and a large spot on anterior part of pleura, all ferruginous ; tubercles 
pale yellow suffused with red; mesothorax entirely black; tegulz 
shining hyaline testaceous, with two pale yellow spots ; wings dusky 
at apex, otherwise nearly clear; stigma dark ferruginous; b. n. going 
a long distance basad of t. m.; second s. m. large, broad above, 
receiving the r. n. at the beginning of its last third; third t. ec. 
abruptly bent; legs red, without yellow, except that the anterior 
femora are suffusedly yellowish in front; a little black at base of 
anterior femora, more on middle femora, and hind femora broadly 
black beneath except at apex; abdomen rather well punctured ; first 
segment black basally, and with the broad band red without any 
yellow ; second segment red, with an exceedingly broad lemon-yellow 
band, narrowly interrupted in the middle (by a longitudinal red band) 
and notched at each upper lateral corner; segments three to six red 
with yellow bands, on three and four widely interrupted, on six a 
median patch, not reaching the sides of the segment; apical plate 
broad, strongly notched ; venter red, suffused with blackish, and with 
a large diamond-shaped yellow spot at extreme apex. In the tables 
of Rocky Mountain Nomada runs to N. vicinalis, Cresson, from which 
it differs by the large lateral face-marks, first abdominal segment 
without yellow, &amp;c. 


Hab. Trout Spring, Gallinas Canyon, New Mexico, May 
24th (T. D. A. Cockerell). 


Osmia malina, n. sp. 

@. Length about 9 mm., thick-set, brilliant dark indigo-blue, the 
hind margins of the abdominal segments concolorous and very nar- 
rowly impunctate; legs black, without metallic tints; antenne 
entirely black. Face broad; hair of face and vertex coarse and black, 
but on each side of the antenne is a patch of white hair, recalling the 


NEW AMERICAN BEES. 95 


appearance of O. albolateralis, which is in other respects a very diffe- 
rent species. Lower edge of clypeus black, slightly elevated, but not 
peculiar in any way; mandibles with two pointed teeth, and a trun- 
cate subemarginate inner one ; hair of cheeks black, but a conspicuous 
tuft of white hair on prothorax at sides of base of head; tubercles 
with white hair, pleura with black, sides of metathorax with white ; 
dorsum of thorax with mixed black and white hair, the black pre- 
ponderating, except posteriorly, along hind margin of scutellum ; 
wings very smoky ; legs with short black hair, shining brownish on 
anterior and middle tarsi; abdomen with white hair on first segment 
and extreme base of second; the other segments with short black 
hair, with a few light hairs intermixed on second and third, and much 
glittering white hair on fifth; scopa and hair at sides of abdomen 
black. Superficially like O. wilmatte, Ckll., but distinguished by the 
second s. m. more produced beyond the second r.n., the thorax above 
with much more black hair, the larger ocelli and the tufts of white 
hair on the face. From O. giliarwm, Ckll., it is known by the abun- 
dant black hair on the thorax above, and the white hair on face. 
From O. pikei, Ckil., it differs by the broader, deep blue face, &amp;c. 


Hab. Northern Colorado, in the region near the foothills, 
either in the vicinity of Boulder or Loveland (Clarence De Voss). 


Osmia (Acanthosmioides) nifoata, n. sp. 


3. Length, 9 mm.; dark greenish blue, the abdomen shining ; 
hair of head and thorax entirely white; flagellum black or almost 
above, ferruginous beneath; apical tooth of mandibles very long, the 
other subobsolete, broadly obliquely truncate ; tegule blue in front ; 
wings clear, a little stained along the veins ; legs black with strong 
metallic tints, especially on the femora behind; hair of legs partly 
light and partly dark, the anterior and especially the middle tibiz 
conspicuously fringed with white hair behind ; hind femora strongly 
swollen, their hair largely black; hind tibiz conspicuously bent ; 
inner side of hind basitarsus with dark fuscous hair; first abdominal 
segment with white hair, second with white and black, the others 
with black, a little white near hind margin of third; sixth segment 
entire; seventh bidentate; second ventral longitudinally grooved, and 
with a short compressed apical tooth, scarcely a third the length of 
the segment. As in O. odontogaster, the ventral tooth is sometimes 
slightly bifid at the end. Distinguished from O. odontogaster, CkIL., 
by the entirely different colour, and broader abdomen. It is nearer 
to Osmia ashmeadiz (Acanthosmioides ashmeadir, Titus), but differs 
from that by the much darker flagellum and the absence of a carina 
on the first ventral segment. The eyes are sage-green. 


Hab. Troublesome, Colorado, 7345 ft., June 8th and 9th, 
1908 ; three males (S. A. Rohwer). This is the first Acanthos- 
mioides from the Rocky Mountains.

NOTES ON BRACONIDA.—IX.: ON THE REMAINDER 
OF MARSHALL’S COLLECTION. 


By CuaupE Morey, F.E.S., &amp;e. 


I rounp but little to note on going through the remainder of 
this valuable collection at the beginning of March. Such facts 
as are noteworthy relate to the synonymy and rectification of 
the British list. 

Meteorus brevipes, Wesm.: In the second volume of his 
‘Bracon. d’Kurope’ (André, 1891), Marshall inserts this as an 
insufficiently described species at the end of its genus, with the 
remark, ‘‘ Belgique (Bruxelles); un seul examplaire connu.” 
Subsequently he evidently succeeded in recognizing it, for in his 
collection are eight males from Botusfleming, St. Albans, and 
Cornworthy. It is somewhat similar superficially to M. jfilator, 
Hal., though of stouter conformation.—Calyptus ruficoxis, Wesm. : 
One female is from ‘‘ Darenth Wood”’; it was only previously 
recorded from Belgium and Holland. — Alloa contracta, Nees, 
male, is synonymous with Lamadatha testaceipes, Cam. !—Blacus 
humilis, Nees, is a very doubtful species, and is, at least tem- 
porarily, sunk to B. trivialis, Hal. — Blacus aptenodytes, Marsh., 
is a synonym of Blacus mamuillanus, Ruthe.— Aphereta major: 
Marshall erects a form he had previously (André, ‘ Bracon. 
d’Europ.’ ii. 401) considered a variety of A. cephalotes, Hal., to 
the dignity of specific rank under this name, and records it from 
‘‘ Angleterre.” The type is not in his collection.—Haliday’s two 
species of Prosapha, Forst., are now synonymised under the 
earlier name, speculum, Hal. — Aspilota distracta, Nees, is a 
variety of the same author’s earlier described ‘‘ Bassus”’ concolor. 
—The British Museum collection of British Aphidiine (Flexili- 
ventres) is peculiarly full; it contains many of Haliday’s original 
specimens, a large collection, together with the Aphididous hosts 
from Bignell, and all those in Marshall’s possession; others 
from Stephens’s and Desvignes’s collections have not yet been 
amalgamated, through lack of time to synonymise the old (and 
often MS.) names under which they at present stand. 

Ditherus ruficollis, Cameron, the male type of which was 
acquired by the Museum authorities in 1902, is nothing but a 
synonym of Cardiochiles saltator, Nees. It is here represented 
by both sexes, ex coll. Sir 8. S. Saunders, from Albania; 
ex coll. Ruthe, from Germany; and ex coll. Marshall, from 
‘* Caucase.” 

The National Collection of British Braconide is now re- 
arranged.

NOTE ON THE SUPPOSED LARVA OF PIMPLA OCU- 
LATORIA, F., FIGURED IN MORLEY’S ‘ BRITISH 
ICHNEUMONS,’ VOL. III., 1908, AND ITS LOCATION 
AMONG THE DIPTERA. 


By J. H. Conum, F.E.S. 


Mr. Craupr Morury has described and figured on p. 114 
of his latest volume on British Ichneumons what he supposed 
might be the larva of Pimpla oculatoria, F., found in an egg-bag 
of Epeira diademata, taken from under the coping of a garden 
wall in Ipswich; this larva cast its skin soon after he found it, 
but ultimately died. 

To Mr. Morley this was an “‘ichneumonidous larva of most 
unusual form and colour;”’ still, the known fact of the asso- 
ciation of P. oculatoria with spiders, and of its having been bred. 
from the egg-bag of this particular spider, naturally led him to 
believe that the connection between the larva he found and the 
ichneumon, though ‘ unsatisfactory,” was “‘ extremely probably 
correct.” 

My attention was attracted to his figure by its great simi- 
larity to the larve of some Diptera, while the fact that Mr. 
Morley had found in another egg-bag of the same spider given 
to him by the Rey. O. Pickard-Cambridge one similar larva- 
skin with ‘the very distinctive rostrum of the . . . described 
larva,’ and in the same egg-bag were Four cocoons of the 
Pimpla, favoured the conclusion that this must be a Dipterous 
larva with the Pimpla parasitic upon it. 

Mr. Morley generously allowed Dr. Sharp to examine the 
larval skin, and he writes: ‘‘It is no doubt that of a Dipteron 
of the family Stratiomyide. From its appearance it may have 
been parasitised; it has, at any rate, not been naturally cast off.” 

It would therefore appear that there must be a species of 
Stratiomyide, living in the larval state upon the eggs of Hpeira 
diademata, though the present knowledge of the larval habits 
of the family in no way supports the possibility of such an 
occurrence. The only genus of Diptera in the neighbourhood 
of the Stratiomyide, said to have been bred from the cocoons of 
spiders, is Acrocera (Cyrtide), but the presence of Acrocera in 
the middle of Ipswich would be somewhat remarkable. 

It remains for someone to clear up this interesting question 
by rearing one of these larva, which unfortunately Mr. Morley 
failed to do. 

[That the attack upon the spiders’ egg should be in. the 
form of hyperparasitism has never before been suggested, and 
certainly did not occur to me when writing my article upon 
the subject (Ichn. Brit. iii. 113-115), which is certainly worthy 
of very close attention (cf. Grav. Ichn. Hurop. i. 154; Westw.

THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITAA. 


By Grorce Wueeter, M.A., F.E.S. 
(Continued from p. 32.) 


THERE is one more named form belonging to the navarina 
group, which was originally supposed by de Sélys-Longchamps 
to be asteria, and so named by him, doubtfully, in his ‘ Mnum- 
ération des Insectes Lépidoptéres de la Belgique,’ in 1845. In 
1857, however, it was given as an aberration of athalia (‘ Annales 
de la Société Entomologique Belge, vol. i. p. 19) under the name 
of asteriades, de Sélys-Longchamps, and is briefly described as 
‘tres petit et trés noir.” 

With regard to the greater variety of colouring on the upper 
side, in which some specimens, especially females, approach 
nearer to the Aurinia-group, there seems to be only one named 
form in which this peculiarity is prominent, and even in this 
case the insect seems to be named rather after a peculiarity of 
the un. s. h. w. than from anything in the appearance of the 
up. 8., viz.: leucippe, Schneider, ‘Systematische Beschreibung,’ 
p. 209 (1787). This form was described as a distinct species, 
in the following terms: ‘“‘ Alis dentatis, supra fuscis, primoribus 
ad marginem luteis striis duabus venisque nigris; posterioribus 
serie triplici macularum pallidiorum et subtus fasciis fulvis 
flavis et albis.”” Reference is made to Esper’s ‘ Schmetterlinge 
Kuropas,’ pl. xxx., fig. 2, which, in spite of what Schneider says 
to the contrary, shows it to bea female aberration of athalia, 
with suffusion extending over the basal half of each wing, and 
having the lunules on the up. s. h. w. lighter, and the ground 
colour between the outer and inner lines redder than usual ; 
the very narrow streak of ground colour showing within the 
inner line is of normal colour. The un. s. f. w. has in places 
a redder shade than usual, and the elbowed line is clearly 
marked by large black spots throughout. The h. w. has the 
terminal lunules, the outer half of the central band, the light 
spot, and part of the basal band white; hence, it would seem, 
the name. Schneider regards this form as being included in 
Linneus’ maturna, showing that the variation of colour on the 
upper side was in his eyes very noticeable. Seba’s illustration 
(‘ Thesaurus,’ pl. iii. A., figs. 1-4), to which he refers, appears 
to me, so far as it 1s possible to judge, to represent athalia. To 
Petiver’s ‘Icones Papilionum Britanniz,’ I have unfortunately 
been unable to refer, as there is no copy of this work in the 
British Museum, nor in any of the other great London libraries. 


THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELIT@MA. 99 


An aberrational form of this spécies was described and 
figured in the ‘Bulletin de la Société Lépidoptérologique de 
Genéve,’ vol. i. pt. iii. p. 262, pl. 8, fig. 5 (1908), under the 
name of ab. alba, Rehfous. It is described as follows: ‘‘la 
couleur du fond, normalement fauve, est remplacée par du blanc 
pur. Sur le dessus des ailes il ne reste pas la moindre parcelle 
de la couleur normale; les dessins foneés n’entourent que du 
blanc. Dessous, de legéres traces de fauve se retrouvent sur 
les nervures et de chaque coté des lignes noires.”* This appears 
to be a singularly perfect form of albino, for the colouring matter 
is absent not only from the ordinary fulvous scales but from 
the feathery portion at the base of the wings, from the fringes, 
and to a great extent from the palpi and legs. This example 
was taken at Iselle on the south side of the Simplon on July 14th, 
1907, and in the same paper another similar specimen is men- 
tioned as having been taken near Geneva on July 13th, 1904. 
With regard to the species to which these aberrations are 
referred, the dates would seem to leave no doubt as to the 
correctness of the diagnosis, even if the illustration of M. 
Rehfous’s specimen were not in itself conclusive. In a footnote 
it is added that the name is intended to serve as a concise 
description, and to apply not only to the species to which these 
particular examples belong but to similar aberrations of other 
species; M. dictynna, M. didyma, Argynnis (Brenthis) selene, 
and A. (Issoria) lathonia are specially mentioned. It will indeed 
be an advantage if this extended definition be accepted and 
adhered to more completely than has been done in the similar 
but far more extended case of the Lycenid aberrational forms 
dealt with by Courvoisier in the ‘ Bulletin de la Société Entomo- 
logique Suisse,’ vol. xi., pt. i, pp. 18-25, pl. ii. (1903), where 
general names applicable to all the usual forms of aberration 
common to several species were suggested. Some of these were 
no doubt barred in certain cases by the ‘law of priority,” but 
in all others these names ought certainly to have been accepted, 
even if this be not a case (as I most strongly hold it to be) where 
this apparently iren law of priority should have been made to 
bend. Surely it is not now outside the range of practical 
polities to press for the formation of an international council 
by which all such questions should be definitely decided? There 
are, of course, certain obvious difficulties in the way, and in 
making the attempt, others, unforeseen, would probably come 
to light, but none appear to be of such a character as to be 
necessarily insurmountable, and the result in clearness of 
meaning, in saving of time and labour, and in turning valuable 


* The ground colour, normally fulvous, is replaced by pure white; on 
the upper side of the wings there does not remain the slightest particle of 
the normal colour, the dark design surrounds nothing but white. Beneath, 
slight traces of the fulvous again appear on the nervures, and at each side 
of the black lines.

channel would be incalculable.

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


THe Coccip GENUS CrRroruto.— Having occasion to examine 
some material of Ceroputo calcitectus (Ckll.), collected by Mr. E. 
Bethel on Agropyron at Canon City, Colorado (the species new to 
Colorado), I chanced to notice the resemblance of the male, especially 
in the venation, to Monophlebus trivenosus, Germ. &amp; Ber., from Baltic 
amber. Upon comparing the figure of M. trivenosus with a male 
C. calcitectus it became evident that they were congeneric, so the 
amber fossil must be known as Ceroputo trivenosus. The only note- 
worthy difference between the two is that the caudal style is con- 
siderably shorter and broader in the fossil.—T. D. A. CockmRELL. 


A Lirrte Work on Sprpers.—Though the study of spiders is 
not considered strictly a part of entomology—at least, in Britain— 
yet most ‘general entomologists” take some interest in them. 
Possibly the lack of a cheap, convenient, modern manual has deterred 
many from paying attention to these interesting forms. Recently I 
have had occasion to work up the spiders of the Hawaiian sugar-cane 
fields. Many of these are immigrants, and although, of course, 
Simon’s great volumes are indispensable to any serious spider work, 
yet I have found a more modest little book very useful in giving me 
a preliminary idea (in the absence of a reference collection) of these 
immigrants at the outset of my studies, as Simon’s ‘ Histoire Naturelle 
des Araignées’ does not deal fully with species. Planet’s ‘‘ Araignées,” 
published in 1905 as the fourteenth part of Deyrolle’s ‘ Histoire Natu- 
relle dela France,’ has not, I believe, been noted as yet in the ‘ Ento- 
~ mologist,’ but will, I am sure, be very useful to any British entomolo- 
gist who is at all interested in spiders. It is portable, cheap, runs to 
341 pages, 18 well-executed plates, and 230 text figures, making a 
total of 370 figs. As the proof-sheets were read by Mr. Simon, the 
accuracy of the volume is guaranteed.—G. W. KrrKapy. 


ACROLITA CONSEQUANA, H.-S., in DEvonsHIRE.—I have to record 
the discovery of the larvee of this local Tortrix by my wife in South 
Devon in July, 1907. They were feeding on the seed-heads of the 
spurge (Huphorbia paralsas) on the sandy flats near the sea. The 
imagines, seven in number, duly emerged on August 6th following. 
They are smaller than usual, owing no doubt to the drying of the food- 
plant on our return home. I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. 
H. A. Atmore, F.E.S8., of King’s Lynn, for confirming the identity of 
the species. As far as I can discover it does not appear to have been 
recorded for this county before. Mr. Stainton describes it under the 
name of Pacilochroma hawkerana, and gives as its locality ‘on the 
Hampshire coast” (‘Manual,’ vol. ii. p. 239). Mr. Meyrick records 
it from Hants and Dorset (‘ Handbook,’ p. 505). Mr. Barrett, on 
p. 73, vol. xi. says: ‘It is only known to be found in Hayling Island,

RECENT LITERATURE. 


The Genitalia of the Grown Noctwide of the Lepidoptera of the 
British Islands. By F. N. Pierce, F.E.S. Pp. xii., 88, pls, 
xxxll. Liverpool: A. W. Duncan, 65, South John Street. 
1909. “Wsxod: 


Tuts book marks an era in the study of the British Lepidoptera. 
Mr. Pierce tells us it is the outcome of twenty years’ study, and 
many students of British Lepidoptera during that period have known 
him as expert in making preparations of the organs here treated of 
and as learned in the study of the specimens so treated. The maga- 
zines during that period report many instances in which questions 
of specific identity or differentiation have been referred to him for 
investigation, not only in the Noctuz but more or less throughout 
the Lepidoptera, and always with a result advancing our knowledge. 

The volume is the first attempt that has been made to describe 
these appendages throughout a whole family of the fauna of a dis- 
trict. There are figures of the genitalia of some three hundred 
and fifteen species, the Noctue of the British Islands. Of course, 
this is after all but a flea-bite to what an examination of all the Noctuze 
would be, the Catalogue of these by Sir George Hampson presenting 
a vista of almost interminable volumes. 

The earliest observations on the genitalia of the Noctuz that we 
recollect are those of Lederer (‘ Noctuinen Europa,’ 1857) ; he figures 
the end of the clasp in thirty species.. It is interesting to note that 
his figures are crude to the last degree, yet illustrate that these parts 
vary in the different species. Down almost to the present time we 
find much vagueness in figures of these organs, as in a recent 
illustration in a German periodical figures appeared of the genitalia 
of Hveres argiades to prove its identity with alcetas, yet the figures 
would have served equally well for Cupido minimus or even sebrus. 
liven Scudder’s figures are often rather vague, and quite inadequate 
to convey any very definite idea of the structures, and would often 
fail to distinguish allied species, although they are very nicely drawn. 

One of the earliest really satisfactory plates of male appendages 
of Noctuz is plate xi. in the first vol. of ‘Iris’ (1884) of four 
species of the lucernea group of Agrotids. 

Dr. K. Jordan’s figures in the Novit. Zool. are certainly far and 
away the most excellent in all respects. His account of the appen- 
dage of the Sphinges is certainly the most complete and accurate 
piece of work of this class that exists, and though only part of a general 
monograph of the Sphinges, is itself a most important monograph, 
and one wishes it were less enfolded with the other material. It 
includes of course our British Sphinges, but these are so few species 
that it hardly strikes us that it is dealing with a British family. 

Those who still retain any doubts as to the value of these organs 


RECENT LITERATURE. 103 


for descriptive purposes must surely lay them aside when they look 
at the figures in this volume, where, in the three hundred odd figures, 
it would be impossible to find one that could be confused with any 
other. Mr. Pierce says he sees no difference between favicolor and 
pallens except size, yet if his figures can be relied on there is consider- 
able difference in some of the proportions and in the spinous 
armature of the cucullus. It is a case like this in which a photo- 
graph, even a poor and imperfect one, would much exceed in value 
any drawing. There are, however, two circumstances which make 
the appendages rather more valuable than any other structure, or 
even than a combination of other characters, for the decision of a 
question either of specific distinction or of generic or familiar 
alliance. One of these is that so long as two forms remain one 
species, that is, are syngamic, or breed together, directly or in- 
directly, these parts are kept identical in both. As soon as they 
become distinct species, divergence of the parts is liable to occur, 
perhaps rapidly. Only syngamy can keep these structures uniform 
throughout a group of forms. When syngamy ceases, they are free 
to vary, the only necessity being that they remain identical through- 
out each syngamic group. But their variation is not restrained by 
any such question as adherence to a food-plant, avoiding particular 
enemies, &amp;c., as nearly all other characters used to define species are 
characters that are kept constant by natural selection. The other 
circumstance is that they are highly organised and for the most part 
hard, chitinised structures, so that they afford many details for 
observation and these details are embodied in forms less difficult to 
seize than many such items as colour, wing markings, «ce. 

It is now well known, Dr. Jordan having perhaps most clearly 
pointed the fact out, that geographical races have these appendages 
varying a little in each race. In some cases, when the segregation 
is great, these no doubt mark incipient species ; when the segregation 
is incomplete, as at the extremities of an extended habitat, there may 
be a difference that is prevented from becoming great by mediate 
syngamy. 

When there is immediate syngamy throughout a group of forms 
(unquestionable species) we may expect to find great uniformity 
throughout the group, but it is highly probable that in such a group 
variations may take place very rapidly, the whole group moving 
together. This seems a conclusion inevitable from the many instances 
we meet with in which the appendages are extremely different in 
closely allied species. 

Unquestionably the appendages, like everything else, are under the 
control of natural selection, but as to what the circumstances are 
that tend to govern the selection, we are certainly at present very 
much in the dark, so that if our argument seems to suggest that 
they have escaped its control, all that is postulated is that they are 
not controlled by any of those items of environment that have to be 
counted on by most other characters, and that as a result two 
newly established species may retain by force of similar environment 
a very similar facis and structure in everything but these structures, 
which are free to vary to any extent if only they vary together 
throughout each specific group. 


104 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Some of the most difficult problems met with in the study of 
these genitalia are involved in the striking discovery that our 
H. nictitans consists not of two species or possibly three, as Mr. Tutt 
established a considerable time ago, though not perhaps incontes- 
tably, but actually of four very distinct species, barely capable of being 
distinguished from each other without reference to the appendages 
(there is no great difficulty in separating typical English paludis and 
nictitans). An examination of the appendages suggest, nevertheless, 
that crinanensis, the new species discovered in his researches by Mr. 
Pierce, belongs not only to a distinct species but that it should be 
placed in a separate genus. The query then presents itself, Is this a 
derivative from the nictitans-paludis-lucens forms, or is it by mimi- 
cry or some other reason approaching them from elsewhere? We 
have never quite satisfied’ ourselves, perhaps from want of proper 
enquiry, that Pierce’s species lucens is identical with nictitans var. 
lucens. At any rate, lucens, Pierce, is to be found amongst series of 
simple nzctrtans in collections, and nictitans var. lucens is very com- 
monly really nzctitans. We have a strong suspicion that nzctitans, 
Pierce, and lucens, Pierce, both have forms that are erronously 
regarded as respectively nictitans and lucens. We find no discussion 
of these questions in ‘‘ The Genitalia.” 

We miss also any discussion of the question as to Noctua thulet, 
Stgr. (conflua, Tr.?). Mr. Pierce mentions conflua as identical 
with festiva, but says nothing as to what he means by conflua, 
whether the mainland var. of festiva, or the distinct or semi-distinet 
Shetland form. 

It must be recognised that all such questions can only be authori- 
tatively solved by exploring also the allied species; only so can the 
amount of difference necessary to prove specific identity or otherwise 
be gauged, as, for instance, Hveres argiades and alcetas and Cupido 
minima have appendages that, at first glance, are absolutely identi- 
cal, but minute, constant differences can be detected that make them 
clearly three species. On the other hand, Plebiws egon has variations 
between individuals, even between the opposite clasps of one indi- 
vidual, that exceed in amount the difference that in the Everids just 
referred to distinguishes species. 

Mr. Pierce’s work will no doubt give an impulse to the study of the 
genitalia of the Lepidoptera, calculated as it is to give much assis- 
tance in their study. Though very complete, it nevertheless suggests 
various directions for further study; the marvellous structure of the 
“Vesica ” (Pierce), an investigation of the curiously aberrant forms 
in stlago and oxyacanthe, are only a little more obvious than many 
other points for investigation.—T. A. C.

THER) KOOD-PLANE OF. LL. ORBITULUS. 
By T. A. Cuapman, M.D., F.Z.S., &amp;ce. 


Last summer (1908) I met with ZL. orbitulus abundantly in 
several of the valleys south of the Rhone, but especially in the 
Binn Thal, in the first week in August. I had the pleasure of 
observing it ovipositing in various localities on the slopes of the 
Holzerspits. The plant on which the butterflies were laying was 
Androsace (Gregoria) vitaliana. 

_ Having ascertained this, I noticed that this plant was com- 
mon wherever the butterflies were most abundant. The plants 
where the butterflies flew were beyond the flowering season, 
possibly two or three weeks, but 1000 ft. or so higher up, where 
there were no orbitulus—in fact, at about the highest limit of the 
plant—it was still in flower, each plant presenting a beautiful 
patch of crowded yellow flowers. The butterflies laid on and 
under the leaves near the summit of each branch or rosette 
of leaves. 

The larve hatched in seven or eight days, and fed freely on 
the leaves of the plant. I succeeded in getting several larve 
full-grown in the first skin, but failed to ggt further. The plants 
I brought home with me soon died, and some I succeeded in 
getting from a nursery were covered with aphides and very un- 
healthy, and soon died, although 1 managed to clear off the 
aphides, and so the experiment came to an end. I was thus 
unable to tell at what stage the larva hybernates; it can hardly 
be later than the second instar, though on the sun-baked slopes 
where much of the plant grew no doubt rapid progress might 
be made. 

However, I have determined the food-plant, which is im- 
portant, and have obtained photographs of the egg (by Mr. 
Tonge), and obtained a preparation of the larva in the first in- 
star showing its structure, well photographed by Mr. F. N. Clark. 

I add a note on the colouring, &amp;c., of the larva when full- 
grown in the first instar. My note was made on September 5th, 


ENTOM.—may, 1909, K 


106 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


1908 :—There are now visible two young larve very nearly full- 
srown in their first instar. There may be others present, but 
unfortunately various rosettes of the plant have died or are 
dying, and it is feared the larve on these have strayed away or 
have died. The plants have been nearly cleared of aphides, but 
it is not certain that these were the cause of their unhealthy 
state. The larve still thrust their heads into the fleshy interior 
of the leaves, mining out the tissue and leaving the upper and 
lower cuticles as colourless pellicles. The larve are nearly 
2mm.in length, and are pale reddish, with the dorsal crest- 
hairs black; they are very evident when on a green leaf, but 
match very closely the reddish dead leaves below the growing 
rosette. Their ground colour is compounded of a pale, almost 
yellowish, ground colour and dark reddish-brown markings. 
The dorsal line is broadly red (brown), the lateral line pale. 
Above the lateral line is a dark band, then a pale one slightly 
echelonned, as bounding below, the next dark line, consisting of 
the oblique lateral lines sloping downwards and backwards. 
Between these and the dorsal band is a pale area, widest at the 
posterior margin of each segment, and having a dark central 
spot. Beneath the lateral line is a darker shade (paler than the 
dark of upper surface), and then the pale ventral area. 


NOTE ON THE PUPATING LARVA OF ATTACUS 
EDWARDSII. 


By J. Henry Watson. 


In a batch of cocoons sent me from Calcutta, and despatched 
thence on February 5th, was one cocoon that had a dull sound 
on shaking it, as if the moth had become ready to emerge. I 
opened the cocoon to see, and was very surprised to find that 
the larva had never shed its skin, and had not advanced in its 
pupation (after completing its cocoon) more than about five 
days—that is to say, it had become dormant, and in this state 
had travelled to England. At the time of writing it has been 
at least a month in cocoon. The head, which is opaque and 
yellow, is still retractable within the first thoracic segment, and 
has the jaws, spinerette, and palpi quite and freely movable ; 
but the antenne are withdrawn apparently from the larval 
antenna cases. The true legs are movable about as much as 
an ordinary larva is during moulting, and they have not been 
as yet withdrawn from the larval shell. Whilst holding it on 
the palm of my hand it made very free movements of the head 
and thoracic segments, stretching them out, and making by the 
rhythmic contraction of its body a vain attempt to walk; the 


PUPATING LARVA OF ATTACUS EDWARDSII. 107 


five pairs of abdominal legs are now quite functionless, and the 
whole of the hinder end of the body not nearly so active as the 
anterior end. I trust I shall be able to get it to pupate and 
emerge as a moth. 

The following is a description of the larva of this beautiful 
and rather rare moth, as far as can be judged by this specimen. 
It bears a great resemblance to Atlas, and I think in its earlier 
stage will be covered with white farina, as there are some slight 
indications of this in the body creases at the hinder segments. 
The whole body is a dull apple green, with faint darker patches 
or spots, exactly as found in Cynthia and Atlas. There is now 
no white farina, this being probably rubbed off. 

The head is dull yellow asin Cynthia. The sides have a 
few small scattered pale blue flat tubercles with black centres, 
and there are two rows of dorsal tubercles of a beautiful shining 
turquoise blue, half an inch or more in length, thicker at the base 
and tapering to a fine point. These tubercles bear a few scat- 
tered wart-like black dots, which each emit a fine bristle. The 
four thoracic tubercles are twice as thick as the others, more 
truncated and heavily covered with black shining warts, and 
are like the others of turquoise blue. The two tubercles onthe 
third thoracic segment are more widely separated than the 
rest, so that they stand out of the line, a little down the sides 
of the larva. The anal segment is of a drake green, with a 
carneous spot-edged turquoise on the anal pair of legs. 

It greedily drank a small drop of water, which I have often 
seen Saturnide larve do. 

I have since had a further consignment; but the box had 
been opened by Postal Authorities, cocoons tipped out and 
tumbled back again anyhow, not packed as they were before, 
the lid pressed down tight, and so crushing the cocoons that 
there are only four out of twenty unhurt (one was entirely 
missing). One which was just alive was in the dormant con- 
dition of the preceding larva, but had been crushed half flat— 
it has now died. 

Really, this wanton destruction by Postal and Customs Autho- 
rities abroad should be redressed. Some years ago I sent to 
North America via New York a corked box with a glass lid 
containing set specimens of rare hybrid Saturnide, tied with 
string and a label, asking the examiners to be careful with them. 
They cut the cord, opened the box, and placed the cord and label 
in the box amongst the moths, closed the lid and tied up the box 
with string of their own. My esteemed friend, Miss Morton, said 
it nearly broke her heart to see them utterly ruined.

COLLECTING IN HUNGARY. 
By Apert F. Rosa, M.D. 


Wuitst in Hungary during the early half of June last 
summer, I had the good fortune to secure a considerable num- 
ber of species of butterflies quite new to the writer, including 
several rare and eastern species occurring in the districts 
visited—the neighbourhood of Budapest and at Herculesbad in 
the Mehadia. 

At Budapest I became acquainted with Herr Abafi Aigner 
Lajos, who gave mea very cordial reception. I was delighted 
to have an opportunity of collecting with him ; and he was good 
enough to introduce me to the Entomological Society of Buda- 
pest on one of their evenings. Herr Aigner recommended an 
early departure for Herculesbad, but being desirous to obtain 
some of the local species before going south, I remained at 
Budapest until the 8th, spending most of the time on that strip 
of what has been apparently at one time fenny ground extending 
from Budafok towards Kelenfold. 

In these parts, the season of 1908 was more forward than 
usual, the weather during my stay fine, though often hazy, and 
butterflies here were very plentiful, and were represented, besides 
the special ones about to be noticed, by many common species, 
including Aporia crategi, which was in extraordinary numbers. 
Nor were the good things long in showing; some large well- 
marked Nomiades cyllarus were taken at the Budafok end, and 
soon the splendid copper Chrysophanus dispar var. rutilus put in 
an appearance, and though never common, I secured a nice 
series of males and three females. These are of fair dimensions, 
measuring, males 34-45 mm., and females 41-47 mm. During 
my stay I only encountered three specimens of C. thersamon, not 
more than one occurring on any single day. Apatura ilia var. 
clytie was common flying about the willows, and occasionally 
alighting on the roadway, but was very wary, only a very few 
being netted. A couple of Melitea trivia were picked up, the 
species being very scarce, though I must admit I expected to 
obtain it later elsewhere; and Canonympha iphis was on the 
wane, but amongst those taken a few are in good condition. 

At Budapest I also got a few full-fed larvee of Thais polyxena, 
which soon pupated, and I expect will emerge at an early date. 
Pyrgus orbifer was worn, but Herr Szlabey, one of the members 
of the Society, handed me a fine example he had just taken. 

I moved on to Herculesbad on the 9th, and arrived in a 
deluge of rain, but fortunately this was the only wet day I ex- 
perienced. South of Temesvar Jozsephvaros the natives of the 
different neighbouring States are much in evidence. The pea- 
santry of this immediate vicinity I believe speak a Latin dialect, 


COLLECTING IN HUNGARY. 109 


Advanced as things evidently were around Budapest, it was 
not so apparent here; some species which it was expected would 
be getting worn were in fine condition. The usual hosts of more 
common, everywhere abundant, late June species were noticeably 
absent, not even one Hpinephele jurtina or Melanargia galatea, 
probably still to come; and in the Cserna-thal at least nearly 
everything was more or less a novelty. The first seen was 
Melitea athalia, often clustered in groups, common enough in 
itself no doubt, but amongst these some were of the fine large 
form mehadiensis.  Neptis lucilla, in fine condition, hovering 
over the herbage on the banks, or at more shrubby ground 
soaring overhead. N. aceris also, not too common and some- 
times worn, in similar spots or often lingering over loose stones, 
where a beam of sunshine finds its way down to the road. Of 
this scarcer species I obtained a series of eight or ten good 
specimens. T'hecla w-album was flying in some numbers, just 
making its debét; and a fine brood of Polyommatus orion ex- 
hibiting a good range of variation, chiefly var. ornata, Stgr., to 
ab. nigra, Gerh., showed up at certain parts. Here also, before 
the road crosses the river, Apatura wis was generally to be 
noted. ‘Two or three of Pieris rape in the, to me, unusual form 
rosstt, Stefanelli (vide Entom. vol. xxxvil. p. 53), and P. napi in 
the var. napee was not infrequent. 

On the other side further down, Chrysophanus alciphron was 
taken flying at wild thyme on the hillside; the specimens, all 
males, being very large and beautiful, expanding about 42 mm. 
One or two of Argynnis adippe var. cleodoxa and plenty of Bren- 
this daphne in the freshest order. 

Accompanied by a Hungarian gentleman from Karansebes, I 
made a start one morning with the intention of ascending one of 
the neighbouring mountains, but we found collecting so good in 
the forest on the higher level, further advance for the nonce was 
deemed inadvisable. The slopes of the mountains here are 
very densely wooded, and for a considerable distance upwards 
damage worked by the larve of the gipsy moth was most exten- 
sive, nothing but the bare branches, from which the larve 
dangled, at the part affected mostly oak. Further up, after 
passing the Weisses Kreuz, the forest vegetation changes, and 
the ravages of the larve become less apparent. At this part 
several Pararge hiera were secured, as large as P. mera, for 
which at first they were mistaken, as also one taken as a sample 
at Budafok, and probably others seen and passed over in the 
Cserna Valley, as the latter species were the same. The path 
descends a little before entering a ravine, leading on to the base 
of the Domogled peak. In this rocky ravine, especially in the 
forenoon, Limenitis populi and its var. tremule were nearly 
always in evidence, and often easily secured. L. camilla and 
L. sibylla were very common, and these I think the writer never 


110 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


saw in better condition. Here also a few Hrebia ligea and an 
occasional Hugonia polychloros. Besides these, Neptis lucilla 
was very common and in perfect condition, especially in the 
neighbourhood of the spring or ‘‘ quelle’ at the upper end of the 
ravine, and so also was Melitea maturna, some of the latter 
being very brightly variegated, sometimes sitting together, a 
dozen or more, with closed wings, from amongst which number 
a few could be selected easily and bottled. A little beyond 
here a large male of Chrysophanus virgauree was netted, the 
only one seen. In the afternoon on the way down, below the 
Kreuz, though not expected for a fortnight later, Pararge roxe- 
lana was frequently disturbed, and fairly easily taken, when 
resting on the bark of trees. 

The following morning I ascended the Suskului, the top of 
which is reached about two hours from the spring. The path at 
first rather monotonous, penetrates upwards through the forest, 
where Pararge hiera occasionally only was noted. After about 
an hour there is a break and an outcrop of rock, insects become 
more plentiful, and on a rough grassy slope near the summit 
Erebia medusa var. psodea was taken in fair condition, Parnassius 
mnemosyne, large and well marked, was exceedingly common, 
and here also I was fortunate in securing two specimens of 
Cenonympha leander, which species, though stated to occur in 
South-east Hungary, I have not noticed recorded from any 
particular locality. While here the sun was obscured by passing 
clouds for several minutes at a time, otherwise I am sure a great 
deal more could have been done at this particular spot. One 
example of what I believe was Hugonia xanthomelas was followed 
but not secured, and Dryas pandora occurred amongst other 
things on the way down. An ascent of the Domogled with a 
wide detour over the range to the west produced little of interest 
beyond some of those already mentioned. 

Dr. Partos, one of the physicians at the Kursalon, informed 
me his man had seen Libythea celtis flying in the market; I 
accordingly went there several times during the forenoon on the 
day I was leaving and got a fine series of the species, which did 
not put in an appearance until between ten and eleven o’clock, 
after which it became very abundant, and was absolutely fresh 
out. The specimens taken vary little excepting in size, measuring 
from 89 to 49 mm. It is a very inconspicuous insect, and I 
recognized that I had got, as I thought, a passing glimpse of it 
also on the road in the Cserna-thal. Butterflies seemed in- 
different to the traffic here in the market, and during the short 
intervals I was about I noticed more than twenty different 
species. 

I had a card of introduction from Herr Aigner to a gentleman 
in Orsova, where he advised me to spend a day; but as I was 
anxious not to miss an expedition to Peszér which was being 


COLLECTING IN HUNGARY. alg bal 


arranged, and which Herr Szlabey said I should join, I did not 
go to Orsova. I was back in Budapest on the 15th; two 
members of the Entomological Society had been at Peszér pro- 
specting the day before, and had only secured of Melanargia 
iapygia var. suwarovius two males. ‘The party had therefore 
decided not to leave until the afternoon of the 17th, as they 
surmised the species was not yet out, and to stay two days. I 
regretted that I could not delay so long; but since then Herr 
Szlabey writes: ‘‘ We visited the place, five entomologists, but 
none of us saw any myrmidone or suwarovius, and we returned 
after two days’ hunting without the least hope of catching the 
latter species this year. I suppose for swwarovius it was already 
too late.” I think it is quite evident that this species is not so 
common in this locality as formerly. 

I append a list which I am afraid is not a full one, as it re- 
presents only those of which specimens were obtained and those 
that I distinctly remember having seen :—

THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITAA. 
By Rey. Georece WHEELER, M.A., F.E.S. 
(Continued from p. 32.) 


AyoTHeER form of peculiar coloration was originally described 
as a separate species, viz.: tessellata, Stephens, ‘ Illustrations,’ 
i, p. 31, pl.v., figs. 1, 2 (1828). His figure is copied from 


THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELIT@MA. 113 


Petiver’s ‘Icones’ (mentioned above), pl. iii., figs. 11, 12.* 
This figure is in a wholly different style from Stephens’ own 
plates, and is evidently faithfully copied, as he says, in the 
rough colouring of the original; the colouring must, however, 
have altered materially in the course of years, as there is a great 
discrepancy between its present appearance and Stephens’ 
description. 

Petiver’s original description (without name) is: ‘‘ Papilio 
fritillaria tessellata serotina subtus straminea,” whilst Stephens’ 
runs: ‘“‘Alis supra fulvis nigro tessellatis, posticis subtus 
stramineis fasciis tribus flavidis lunulisque nigris.” As_ it 
appears at present, the fuscous and fulvous of the up. s. are 
merely two shades of reddish brown (a form which I have met 
with more than once in nature) ; the un. s. f. w. has the lunules 
and a partial second row of spots within the outer subterminal 
yellow, and the rest of the wing normal.in pattern and red-brown 
in colour; the un. s. h. w. has the outer and inner bands 
blackish grey, the terminal, central, and basal bands bright 
yellow; the light spot breaks into the basal band. Stephens’ 
description of it runs, however, as follows: ‘‘ Similar in size 
and shape to M. athalia, but evidently distinct: the wings are 
rather paler above: the anterior more fulvous beneath: the 
posterior are very dissimilar to those of the above insect (athalia), 
being entirely straw-coloured, with black nervures: at the base 
are three large square yellowish spots surrounded by black: an 
arcuated band in the middle composed of yellowish somewhat 
quadrate spots, which are nearly confluent and placed in a double 
row, and edged with black: there is then a streak of black 
lunules pointing outwards: then a marginal band composed of 
yellowish spots encircled with black, each yellow spot being 
(2? bearing) a black lunule: the cilia are white intersected with 
black.” This form was said by Petiver to have been fairly 
common in Cain Wood in his time! 

There remains a named form, difficult to place with certainty, 
but which may possibly belong to athalia, viz., veronice, Dorf- 
meister. We first find this name in the ‘ Verhandlung des 
zoologischen-botanischen Vereins in Wien,’ vol. 1ii., p. 186 (1858), 
where Dorfmeister merely says that this form is near to dictynna, 
but gives no further account of the imago, which he was evidently 
exhibiting and left to speak for itself. He gives a short des- 
cription of the larva and pupa, and for comparison an equally 
short description of those of athalia and parthenie, the total out- 
come of which seems to be that he was quite unacquainted 


* There is a reference in the ‘Illustrations’ to the same author’s 
‘ Catalogue’ which was not published till 1829, which is somewhat puzzling. 
I can only conjecture that Stephens was occupied on both at once, and that 
the earlier part of the Catalogue was written at this time, though not 
published. 


114 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


with parthenie in any stage. For over forty years there seems 
to have existed only the most nebulous idea of this form, but 
in 1896 Hormuzaki described it from two of Dorfmeister’s speci- 
mens in the same magazine, vol. xlv., p. 233. (This page is 
wrongly quoted as 341, both in Staudinger’s ‘ Catalogue,’ and 
in Hormuzuki’s own article in ‘Iris,’ xi., p. 7). Much of this 
description is unavailable, because it is a comparison with a 
specimen bred from a Regensburg larva, and supposed to be 
britomartis, but the correct designation of which does not appear 
with any certainty from the description. There can, however, be 
no question that Hormuzaki was acquainted with Dorfmeister’s 
veronice, and there exists in the national collection at South 
Kensington a specimen of the latter identified by him, a female, 
from which the following description is made :— 

Up. s. f. w.: border broad, lunules small, the third being the 
most prominent; outer subterminal rather broad, inner rather 
broader and curving outwards at inner margin; elbowed line narrow ; 
marginal blotch outlined, and showing much of the ground colour, 
speckled with black scales; stigma outlined, oval, with many black 
scales; space between basal lines filled up with blackish; basal 
suffusion extends along inner margin as far as elbowed line. 

Up. s. h. w.: narrow lunules of ground colour within border ; 
darker ones, still small, within the outer line; basal suffusion ex- 
tends over the rest of the wing, except a few dots within the inner 
line, one spot within what would, if not included in the suffusion, 
be the extra line, and the basal spot. 

Un. s. f. w. Markings very indistinct, except the outer subter- 
minal; inner subterminal and elbowed line indicated only by marked 
costal dots, the other spots which form them only slightly showing 
through from up. s.; marginal blotch small and square, the other 
markings narrow but clear; inner edging line of border angulated 
between the nervures. 

Un. s. h. w.: inner edging line of border slightly angulated ; 
lunules pale; outer band with palish lunules, and the inner part 
dark and broad; central band with the outer part not much paler 
than the inner, and with the third and fourth spots projecting but 
little; inner band darker than outer; fourth spot of basal band 
absent, fifth present. 

This fifth spot of the basal band, is that which is spoken of 
by some of the German writers as the light (or white) spot at 
the anal angle; in his description of veronice in ‘ Iris’ Hormu- 
zaki states that this spot is silvery white, but it is not so in this 
specimen. He also speaks of the striking contrast between the 
colour of the marginal lunules and the darker external border, 
which he describes as being reddish-yellow in the male, and 
dark lemon in thefemale. This contrast certainly exists in the 
specimen under notice, but can hardly be called striking. In 
the South Kensington collection several other specimens are 
placed with this, whose general facies leaves no doubt as to 


FIVE WEEKS IN THE VOLGES. 115 


their belonging to the same form, but all these have the upper 
side darker, with broader black markings (except the inner sub- 
terminal), and with a distinctly broad black border; the outer 
and inner bands of the un. s. h. w. are darker, whilst the dark 
markings on the un. s. f. w. are slighter. 

It is difficult to place this form, and it is with considerable 
diffidence that I have put it among the varieties of athalia, as 
it shows in several respects a somewhat close affinity with 
aurelia; and it is quite probable that when the life histories of 
both are carefully worked out it may prove to be a variety of 
dictynnoides. 

(To be continued.) 


FIVE WEEKS IN THE VOSGES. 
By A. E. Gress, F.L.S. 


(Continued from p. 83.) 


AnotHER pleasant excursion was made on the 10th of the 
same month to the Valley of the Ognon, in the department of 
Haute Sadne, taking train to Le Thillot and driving over the col 
to Le Haut du Them. While the driver was baiting his 
horses at the hotel at the top of the pass, Issoria lathonia flew 
by, and I chased it over the departmental boundary and captured 
it in Haute Sadne. We drove down into the valley at a spank- 
ing pace, and arrived at the station half an hour before the train 
was due to leave, so we decided to walk to the next stopping 
place. On the way we beat out our first specimen of Arachnia 
levana var. prorsa, but it flew across a potato patch where a 
dame of forbidding appearance was at work with her hoe, so we 
let it escape, but met with the species again among some nettles 
near Ternuay, to which place we took the train at a wayside 
station. From Ternuay we walked down the valley to Melisey. 
In the clover fields Colias edusa and C. hyale were flying, and 
another dwarf in the shape of a diminutive specimen of the 
former insect fell to my lot. The commonest butterfly in the 
valley was undoubtedly Leptosia sinapis, which, being just out, 
was in the pink of condition, and next to this graceful little 
Pierid in point of numbers came Brenthis dia, which was flying 
by the roadside everywhere. Near Melisey, on a strip of green- 
sward, we made acquaintance with Everes argiades, of which four 
specimens, evidently of the second brood, came our way. I 
afterwards met with this insect at several places on the lower 
levels, but it was not until the 21st of the month that I saw it 
at St. Mavrice which is at a higher altitude. Except for the 
fact that they are rather large, the specimens taken in the Vosges 
are quite typical. The two Chrysophanids seen during the day 


116 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


were C. alciphron and C. phleas. I again penetrated into Haute 
Sadne on the 23rd July, when I explored the valley of the 
Breuchin as far as the fashionable spa of Luxeuil-les-Bains, again 
partly by train and partly on foot. Unfortunately, I was alone 
on this excursion, as Mr. Barraud had to return to England on 
July 13th. Crossing the mountains from Rupt-sur-Moselle, 
I walked down to Correvillers, taking a very fresh Huvanessa 
polychloros as I neared the village, whence I booked to Luxeuil, 
but a tempting bit of woodland induced me to hurriedly leave 
the train at a stopping-place. Pararge megera was flitting in and 
out of the bushes on the margin of the wood, and Colias edusa, 
like a flying blossom, sailed over the more open ground. Taking 
a forest path which appeared to lead in the right direction I soon 
found myself lost in a maze of umbrageous ridings, where the 
thick foliage of the beeches and oaks afforded a_ pleasant 
shelter from the fierce rays of the mid-day sun, but brought no 
game to the bag. Emerging at length on a stretch of heath 
land I got my bearings and also a nice example of Chryso- 
phanus dorilis, an insect with which I was to become more 
familiar later on. Enquiring at a woodman’s cottage, I was 
shown a quick way to Luxeuil, and just before entering the town, 
in a small meadow, three more C. dorilis were taken in company 
with Nomiades semiargus and Polyommatus alexis. 

The very useful map of the district published by the Syndi- 
cat d’Initiative des Vosges showed that a considerable stretch 
of forest land was to be found in the neighbourhood of Charmes, 
a small country town on the main line to Paris, between Epinal 
and Nancy, so I determined to visit the spot, hoping to find 
Apatura tlia, A. iris, and other woodland species. On the night 
of July 18th Mr. Barraud started for home, and we travelled 
together to Epinal which was as far as I could get that 
night. At an early hour next morning I alighted at the 
station at Charmes, and made for the forest, which could be 
seen on the west of the line. Rain had fallen heavily, making 
everything very wet, but an occasional gleam of sunshine 
awakened the hope that despite the gale which was blowing 
something good might be found. In an old grass-grown pit 
outside the forest a few Everes argiades and Nomiades semiargus 
were trodden up. Then Pieris napi and the ubiquitous Leptosia 
sinapis were met with in a forest glade where the long wet her- 
bage made progression very uncomfortable, but I struck the 
railway and followed a track running between the line and the 
woodland, where Cenonympha arcania was discovered at rest, and 
a batch of ova of Bombyx rubi was found on a leaf of wild 
raspberry. By the time I had reached a point where the rail- 
way crossed the high road, old Sol had temporarily gained the 
upper hand, and a brilliant male A. iris settled on some horse- 
droppings awakened expectations. But iris is a wary insect and

very difficult to approach. A gleam of purple wings and he was 

one. So long as the sun shone I saw a considerable number 
of both the Apturids I was in search of, but they circled round 
the tree-tops quite out of reach, and on their occasional descents 
to earth were too cautious to come within reach of the net, 
approach one never so gently. However, after a great deal of 
running about in the hot sun, two A. iris and one A. ilia var. 
clyte were secured, and a pair of Pararge achine disturbed from 
the hedgerow. A worn female Limenitis sibylla was ovipositing 
on the honeysuckle, and about a dozen eggs rewarded my search, 
but they all proved infertile. Unfortunately, the elements were 
fickle and rain soon began to fall again. Shelter was found 
under a tree, but as there were no signs of clearing up, I reluc- 
tantly abandoned hope and made the best of my way back to 
Charmes, where, after a three miles walk, I found an hotel with 
an English-speaking landlord, a rara avis in these small French 
towns. Jain continued to descend steadily for the greater part 
of the afternoon, so that there was nothing to be done except sit 
in the cafe, where I found another weather-bound traveller 
engaged in entomological pursuits. He was a fisherman, and 
was beguiling the time catching flies which he wrapped carefully 
up in paper to use ag bait. A few turns of my net got him as 
many specimens of Musca domestica as he wanted. Between 
three and four o’clock, as it cleared up a little, 1 determined to 
again try my luck. This time I took another road to the forest, 
only to get a few Hveres argiades, Cupido minima, Lycena arion, 
and Leptosia sinapis, the two former insects being found at rest 
on the broom, a rather curious resting habit for insects with 
such light and therefore conspicuous under sides to adopt, 
because it makes them very clearly visible from a distance, 
hanging from the dark green shoots of the genista. On the way 
to Rambervillers, where the night was spent, I noticed fine 
stretches of woodland, and the next morning returned a few 
miles along the line, but hardly had I left the train and got into 
the forest than a heavy shower fell, which spoiled my chances of 
finding many insects on the wing. Everything was so wet that 
I got on to the line and walked along the permanent way until 
I came to an inviting-looking green lane where the capture of a 
butterfly entirely fresh to the list in the shape of Hnodia dryas, 
male, rewarded my exertions. Vain was the search for other 
specimens, but the morning’s work resulted in the acquisition of 
two Pararge achine, two Cenonympha arcania, two Brenthis dia, 
two Everes argiades, and single specimens of Limenitis sibylla, 
and Thecla ilicis var. cerri, with a few flies of lesser note, 
making a total of fourteen in all. It was not until July 29th 
that I was able to do any more entomological work at Charmes, 
but the story of that expedition may well be told here. Behind 
the town to the east rises a hill which is a landmark for the 


118 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


whole country side. I had arrived in Charmes on the previous 
night, and as the morning broke dull and cloudy I resolved to 
see what could be found on the hillside rather than repeat my 
experience of a wet walk in the forest. Crossing the meadows 
behind the town I disturbed a few specimens of I. argiades and 
N. semiargus, and then making a bee-line for the top through the 
vineyards saw a solitary specimen of Pyrameis cardui, the only 
record I have of its occurrence in the Vosges. In some disused 
quarries on the crown of the hill, besides the two ‘‘blues”’ 
already mentioned, Polyommatus corydon and Rusticus argus 
(egon) were met with. A very pretty lightly-marked example of 
Abraxas grossulariata was caught on the way home. The after- 
noon being a little brighter the forest was again visited, but on the 
road where a fortnight before Aptura iris and 4. ilia were abun- 
dant, not one was now to be seen. About four o’clock, when I 
got into the open country again, the sun came out for an hour 
and sport was very good. On the clumps of wild thyme 
Chrysophanus dorilis was much in evidence, and its congener 
phleas, fresh and bright, spread its golden wings in the sun- 
shine. Colias hyale was flying freely, but C. edusa did not put 
in an appearance, though I met with it on the following morn- 
ing, which I spent on the outskirts of the forest in a more 
northerly direction, when the Lycenids already mentioned were 
the chief objects of attack, a good series of C. dorilis being 
quickly obtained. Altogether my visits to the forests on the 
lower levels were most unfortunate, the weather being showery 
on each occasion, and the atmospheric conditions generally 
not favourable for collecting.

LARVA OF ARGYNNIS LAODICE. 
By T. A. CHapman, M.D., F.Z.S., &amp;c. 


Mr. FrRonAwk’s account of the life-history of A. laodice (antea, 
pp. 49-54, pl. ii.) is so excellent, and his plate seems to me to 
deserve such an overwhelming meed of praise, whether as regards 
accurate and scientific entomology or as a most beautiful example 
of the painter’s art, that I hesitate to make a trifling comment 
thereon. I do so, however, just because it is so good, and there- 
fore possesses, because it deserves, such great weight, that it 
seems desirable that weight should not be given to even a trifling 
inaccuracy. This affects the hairs as shown on the enlarged draw- 
ing of a segment of the first stage larva. Tubercles ii. and iii. are 
shown with an expanded scutcheon, and a hair, and between them 
a bulbous portion, no doubt that referred to in the description as a 
‘bulbous base” of the hair. The figure, then, shows three portions— 
the tubercular scutcheon, the bulb, and the hair, Now, I have never 


THE ANTIPODEAN GENUS PROBOLOIDES. 119 


seen the young larva of laodice, but other Argynnids, and, in fact, all 
larvee, show only two structures, the basal seutcheon and the hair. 
In these Argynnids the hair descends into the scutcheon, and expands 
a little within it, to the distance and amount of the ‘“ bulbous base.” 


The basal margin of the “bulbous base” is internal to the scutcheon, 
and may be seen through its transparent structure, but there is no 
structural line on the outer surface of the scutcheon such as the 
figures give. The other tubercles have precisely the same structure. 


THE ANTIPODEAN GENUS PROBOLOIDES, Moku. 
A CoRRECTION. 


By CuaupE Mortey, F.Z.8., F.E.S. 


In the first volume of my ‘ British Ichneumons’ I described 
two species under a new genus, Proboloides, which is certainly 
valid; but unfortunately there can, I am assured, be no doubt 
regarding the origin of the insects placed therein. They are 
from New Zealand, not Britain! Their right to inclusion in our 
fauna was certified by no less an authority than Rev. H. 8. 
Gorham, and I, consequently, had no hesitation in bringing 
them forward as indigenous. Ihad seen no more till last month, 
when I discovered the same species in the National Collection. 
They should stand :— 

PROBOLOIDES sSOLLicITorIus, Fab.—Ichneumon sollicitorius, Fab., 
Syst. Ent. 382; Spp. Ins. 425, g (type in Mus. Brit.). 
Ichneumon invectus, Smith, Trans. Ent. Soc. 1876, p. 475, 2 
(type in Mus. Oxon). Proboloides glabratus, Morl., Ichn. Brit.

Brit. 1. (1903), 161,. ¢ @ (type in Mus. Morl.). 

I at once wrote to Mr, Gorham respecting their origin, and 


120 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


he kindly replied (in lit., 15th March, 1909) :—‘‘I can say that 
of my own knowledge I never had any ichneumons from New 
Zealand or any other country in my possession. If I had taken 
them out of any box of foreign insects, I am sure I should have 
marked them so: I am very ‘particular on such points. I should 
have told you if I had any doubt. My impression is that they 
were some I took in the New Forest; but I say this with reserve, 
as it is only a guess.” We must, nevertheless, regard them as 
antipodean, and suppose they had found their way into Mr. 
Gorham’s collection from some of the numerous boxes he so 
frequently receives of Malacoderma from all parts of the world. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


A Morning at AMELIE-LES-Bains, PyrintzEs ORIENTALES.— 
Arriving here in the afternoon of April 6th, a short walk showed that 
the season was not so far advanced as it usually is at Hyéres at this 
date. The blackthorn was in full bloom, only an early bush here and 
there going over. Almonds apparently over, but peaches in full 
flower; cherries, some fully out, but many only just in bud. Here 
and there plums and pears in flower, some patches of lupins flower- 
ing; but for the most part things had a very bare wintry aspect; a 
sharp but hardly cold wind helped me to regard things as a little in- 
clement. The snow on the Canigou was very low down. The highest 
point is not apparently visible from Amelie-les-Bains, and the outline 
is somewhat irregular; still the lofty snowy slopes dominating the 
landscape, whenever it formed part of it, compelled us to recognize a 
certain resemblance to the view of Etna from Taormina before its 
winter snows are melted, but the smooth conical outline of Etna 
gives it a majesty less obvious in the Canigou. On the 7th the 
weather was perfect, with little or no wind. A walk up the sunny 
side of the valley of the Teche showed that a good many butterflies 
were already on the wing. gerva was very frequent, and was the 
only species that was certainly going over, not one specimen in fair 
condition being seen. H. meg@ra was more common, females scarce, 
males generally but not always somewhat worn. P. rape was com- 
mon, but P. manni was not detected. L. argiolus was frequent, 
generally worn; L. baton in fine condition, just coming out. Several 
A. lathonia were seen, of rather small size, one very small ; several 
C. edusa were seen, but not taken; S. cleopatra was not very com- 
mon, but afforded its welcome and brilliant contribution to the land- 
scape not unfrequently. P. fersthameli was frequently seen; a habit 
of assuming that P. podalirvws was not worth catching, and in any 
case could be got in any numbers if required, may account for the 
circumstance that seeing it and catching it proved to be by no means 
synonymous. A single specimen of L. celtos was taken ; no tree or 
plant of Celtzs australis could be found, but one or two were after- 
wards found close to the hotel. L. sinapis, P. daplidice, V. 10 and 
P. atalanta, and S.alcee complete the list of insects seen, No speci- 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. Lal 


men of Huchloé was seen, nor was J’. ballus met with, nor 7’. cas- 
sandra. What may appear as the season advances remains to be seen. 
The locality is clearly one not to be despised, though this first sampling 
suggests that it has neither the richness nor variety of Hyéres. 

A further week’s stay results in a marvellous advance of vegeta- 
tion being observed; trees are green instead of brown, the horse- 
chestnut almost in flower. One still notes the absence of any 
Euchloé, of Thais cassandra, and of Thestor ballus. No ground suit- 
able for either of the latter has been noticed. JZ. baton is abunbant 
in places, 7’. medesicaste frequent, and ZL. celtis more often seen 
than the rarity of its food-plant would make one expect. Another 
notable absentee is P. carduti; but V. polychloros is almost abundant, 
and 20, atalanta, urtice, antiopa, and c-album frequently occur. 1’. 
tages and C. phleas are frequent, and mera, machaon, melanops, and 
pamphilus have put in an appearance, with 7. rwbt common in places. 
LL. sinapis is now abundant, and may frequently be seen ovipositing 
on Dorycniwm suffruticosum.—T. A. CHapmMan; April 14th, 1909. 


GENITALIA OF THE Nocruip#.—Some expressions in the notice 
of Mr. Pierce’s volume (Entom. April, 1909) suggest that your re- 
viewer has overlooked the excellent work of Elwes and Edwards on 
the Oriental Hesperid, and especially the very complete examination 
recorded in the ‘ Biologia’ of the appendages of the Hesperidx of 
Central America.—T. A. CHapman; Betula, Reigate, April 2nd, 1909.

Recent Saves or LEPIDOPTERA AT “STEVENS’S.”’— In the last 
issue of the ‘ Entomologist’ (p. 101) reference was made to some 
varieties, which, looking at the prices they realized, were the gems of 
the Maddison Collection. 

To deal with all the other more or less interesting aberrations 
would occupy more space than is available for the purpose, so refer- 
ence can only be made to those that appear to be most noteworthy. 

A specimen of Papilio machaon, with all the markings diffused, 
18/-. A curious leaden-coloured specimen of Preris brassice, 10/-. 
A bright buff, almost orange-coloured, P. napz from Donegal, 21/-. 
Three aberrations, put up separately, of Huchloé cardamines sold for 
70/-, the best of the trio being a male without discal spot; this made 
two guineas. A queer looking specimen of Gonepteryx rhamni, with 
the right fore wing and part of left fore and hind wings male, made 
55/-; and a pure white female of the same species 25/-. Eleven 
aberrations of A. paphia, offered singly, brought in £17 6s. The 
lowest sums given were 5/-, 10/-, 10/6, and 18/-, and the higher 
32/6, 35/-, 37/6, 40/-, 45/-, 55/-, and 57/6. A var. of A. aglaia with 
suffused markings, one with large black blotches, and other examples 
of the species, 80/-. A dark male A. latona, taken by the late Mr. 8. 
Stevens near Dover, September, 1872, made 50/-. One example of 
A. ewphrosyne with very dark hind wings (Abbot’s Wood, 1899), 22/-. 
A white var., two suffused dark specimens, and eight other examples 
of A. selene, 70/-. An aberration of Melitea aurima, fore wings 
black, with a row of fulvous hind marginal spots (Abbot’s Wood, 
1903), 95/-. Another example of M. awrinia, rayed under side, basal 
half of hind wings dark, outer light, 50/-. A specimen of Polygonia 
c-album with large black patches on all the wings, 30/—; and one with 
the hind wings and the outer margins and costa of fore wings very 
dark (Wye Valley, July, 1906), 80/-. Six Vanessa antiopa realized 
94/-, the price per specimen ranging from 10/— to 18/-. Two excep- 
tional varieties of V. wrtice made £7 15s., and four other nice aberra- 
tions of this species brought in 62/-. Four specimens of V. 2o with 
aberrant eye-spots sold at 15/—, 21/—, 21/-, and 40/— each. 

A variety of Pyrameis atalanta with the band much interrupted, 
and a large white blotch on the fore wings (Isle of Wight, August, 
1901), 40/-; whilst another specimen, a very fine under side var., 
much suffused on both upper and under sides, also from Isle of 
Wight (August, 1901), £5. 

Light nearly black varieties of Limenitis sibylla were put up in 
couples, and made 10/-, 12/—, 32/6, and 40/— per lot. A single speci- 
men with obscure bands and red spot on fore wings sold for 35/—, and 
a velvety black example went for a guinea. 

Two aberrations of Satyrus semele, one of which was a white form 
from Swanage, 1905, 40/-. A very pale variety of Hpinephele zanira, 
cream coloured, with orange suffusion on fore wings, 22/—; one almost 
white (Folkestone, 1890), 42/-. 

Seventeen specimens, offered singly, of Chrysophanus dispar 
realized £64 ds., the highest price per specimen being 110/-, female, 
and the lowest 25 /-, male, 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 123 


Two vars. of C. phlzas, one of which was the silvery form, brought 
two guineas; one aberration with large black spots on the fore wings, 
together with one pale form approaching ab. schmidtit, sold for 16/—; 
another with large spots forming band on the fore wings, 30/-. 
Highteen other varieties of C. phigas, comprised in five lots, made 
117/-. The best varieties of Lycena bellargus and L. corydon, offered

trifolit, two lots, each containing one yellow aberration and one pale 
with confluent spots, 8/— per lot. Three lots, each comprising one 
yellow and one yellowish pink Z. filipendule, 16/— per lot. 

Long series of Sessiide, about two hundred specimens in all, sold 
for rather less than £5. 

Among numerous aberrations of Arctia cata (other than those 
previously mentioned) the most noteworthy were—one with uni- 
colorous deep brown fore wings and jet-black hind wings, £5 10s. ; 
one “fore wings all brown with white markings showing faintly, 
hind wings jet-black with inner marginal fringe pink,” £3 15s.; a 
remarkably pale specimen with light brown and yellow markings on a 
cream ground, £3 10s. The best of the varieties of A. villica sold for 
21/-, 32/6, 45/-, 65/-, and 95/— each; and a couple of aberrations, 
one with large apical blotch and the other with smoky hind wings, 
made 60/-. Hight pairs of Lelia cenosa realized from 8/- to 16/— 
per pair; two not very good males were bought for 10/-, and three 
poor specimens made 15/-. A pair of Drepana harpagula (sicula), 
from Leigh Woods, sold for 20/—; four females from the same locality 
made 28/—; five other examples of the same sex made only 17/-. 

There were twenty-two specimens of Cerwra bicuspis; twelve of 
these, from Tilgate, sold in threes at 6/— and 7/- per lot, and the 
others at about same rates. An odd example of Saturnia pavonia, 
with female fore wings and male hind wings, the latter with streak of 
the female colour, fetched 50/-. Twenty-seven examples of Acronycta 
strigosa and twenty-five A. auricoma averaged 2/— to 2/6 apiece. A 


124 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


series of Leucania favicolor, including yellow, reddish ochreous, and 
red forms, were offered in five lots, and made £3 17s. Hight Tapino- 
stola concolor (Hunts) and sixteen Nonagria “neurica”’ (Cambs), with 
other things, went for 23/-. A similar lot of J’. concolor, with twelve 
“neurica,”’ five of which were melanic (from Horning), made 37/6. 
Two examples of Luperina dumerilit (Rainham, 1895, ex Burney 
coll.), put up with sixty specimens of other species, were sold for 
6/-. Six Crymodes exulis from Shetland, sold in couples, realized 
97/6; and four others from Rannoch (var. assimilis), 63/—; two from 
Perthshire and one from Unst made 45/-; five others from Unst,

A specimen of Hydrilla palustris from Wicken Fen, together with 
an example (ex coll. Hodgkinson), made 20/—; two others, one of 
which was from Cambridge, 20/-; and a pair (female, Ringwood, 
Hants), 16/-. 

The collection of British Lepidoptera formed by Mr. C. H. Schill, 
and also that of Mr. A. M. Smallpiece, were sold on January 26th 
last. In the first-named collection there were four specimens of 
Chrysophanus dispar, one of which, a large female, made 80/-, a large 
male sold for five shillings less; a male (Tugwell coll.) went for 40/-, 
and another (Chapell coll.) 22/-. One pair of L. cwnosa made 30/-, 
and another pair 14/-. An unusually fine male specimen of N. sub- 
rosea realized £5. The most important items in the Smallpiece 
collection were:—Two aberrations of Argynnis paphia, reared by 
L. W. Newman in 1908 from New Forest ova; the male made 40/-, and 
the female £5. A very rubbed black ab. of Limenitis sibylla sold 
for 7/-. Four examples of Leucania vitellina (Kent, Devon, and 
Brighton), 19/-. Ten Caradrina exigua sold at from 1/6 to 3/- each, 
and eight A. alpina (Rannoch) 17/- the lot. Four fine Crymodes 
exulis (Shetland) made 32/6 and 28/- per couple, and eight others 
from the same locality, 46/-. Two Sussex specimens of C. gnaphalia 
fetched 17/-. Of varieties of Abraxas grossulariata, the best five 
brought in a total of 100/6. 

Weare indebted to our colleague Mr. R. Adkin for the following :— 
Yet another sale has been held, the collection of Lepidoptera formed 
by the late Mr. J. Pardoe being dispersed at Stevens’s on March 28rd. 
The specimens were as a rule in good condition, but for the most 
part lacked data. The more notable lots included seventeen speci- 
mens of Polyommatus dispar, which sold for a total of £38 8s., the 
highest price obtained for single specimens being £5 for a fine female, 
£3 15s. for a fine male, and £3 10s. for a fine under side male, and 
the lowest, 16/-, for a rather poor male. A remarkably large and 
fine specimen of Deiopeia pulchella, taken by Mr. W. J. Austen at 
Folkestone, August 14th, 1892, brought 25/-, and two Crymodes 
exulis, taken at Rannoch, £2 5s. Less authenticated specimens 
brought poor prices; thus lots 1, 2, and 3, each containing among 
other species three specimens of Pieris daplidice, realized an average 
of 4/— per lot; eleven Argynnis latona brought a total of 10/-. Two 
lots of fifty “ blues,’”’ each including four Lycena semiargus, sold for 
3/- per lot; while five Deilephila ewphorbie failed to find a bidder 
until linked with three D. livornica, when they were knocked 
down for 4/-.

CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


PHIGALIA PEDARIA ab. MONACHARIA.—Ten or twelve years ago I 
took an example of this melanic aberration in Charnwood Forest. 
In 1908 I took another specimen in the same locality, which I 
brought home and placed in a breeding-cage, a roomy contrivance 
with many chinks, with a typical female that had emerged from a 
larva taken in the same wood. I did not notice that they paired, but 
subsequently I found a few eggs laid around and in the groove of a 
screw-head and in a joint adjacent to it. It was hardly possible to 
get at these, and I waited till they hatched, as a result of which some 
doubtless escaped ; at all events I only reared some two dozen larve 
or thereabouts. The moths emerged in March last from 18th to 23rd, 
with the exception of a single male which appeared on Feb. 21st, 
after which a long spell of cold weather ensued. The sexes were in 
equal proportion, eleven males and eleven females. Of the males 
four were ab. monacharia, seven were typical, and there were no 
intermediate forms; of the females eight appeared to be more or less 
typical—that is, the under side was copiously sprinkled with pale 
grey or whitish, but the abdomen above in two examples was 
brownish, in six blackish. The three remaining specimens were 
black above, and the light grey powdering beneath was confined to 
the thorax and legs, the under side of the abdomen being uniformly 
dark grey or blackish. I was able to pair two of these dark females 
with black males and obtained ova, and I also paired a couple of 
typical males and females of the same stock. If I am successful in 
rearing the progeny, the results will be of some interest. This black 
variety or aberration of P. pedaria extends apparently over a con- 
siderable area in the county of Leicester. It has been taken at 
Knighton on the outskirts of Leicester, and, I think, also at Market 
Bosworth by Mr. F. Bouskell, and in Charnwood Forest, as mentioned 
above. An example has also been reported this year from Measham, 
in the extreme north-west of the county.—(Rev.) W. G. WHITTINGHAM; 
Knighton Vicarage, Leicester. 


AM@BE OLIVATA IN Aprin.—A newly emerged Larentia (Amebe) 
olivata at Beaconsfield, April 18th.—C. G. Douautry; 27, South 
Molton Street, W., April 19th, 1909. 


BREPHOS PARTHENIAS AT SALLOW-BLOOM. — This pretty moth 
came freely to sallow-catkins in Delamere Forest, April 10th. From 
a solitary bush, with a net fixed to the end of a bamboo eight or ten 
feet long, I could have taken thirty to forty specimens in a couple of 
hours, possibly more. Their chief feeding-time seemed to diminish 
towards noon. The exceptional numbers on this occasion were 
doubtless due to the warm, sunny day. A Vanessa urtice also paid 
a lengthened visit to the same bush.—J. ArKLE; Chester. 


HYBERNIA MARGINARIA var. FUSCATA.—This variety occurs fre- 
quently in Leicestershire, but the proportion of the true variety, 
uniformly dark brownish with the markings imperceptible or nearly 
so, is not greater, as far as my observation goes, than five per cent. 
It varies in the depth of the colour. Examples, however, are much 
more common in which, while the markings are conspicuous, the

wings are clouded with darker patches, particularly in the hind 
marginal area. Last year I found a dark female, and obtained a 
fuscata male to pair. A good many of the resulting larvee died, and 
I only reared eighteen examples, which emerged last March. Curiously 
everyone was a female; only four of these were typical. The re- 
mainder were all dark in body and wing; in three examples almost 
uniformly rich dark brown nearly black, but with the lines perceptibly 
blacker, the rest have a somewhat less dark hind marginal area. I 
obtained again a pairing with a wild fuscata male, and have, as a 
result, a batch of eggs.—(Rev.) W. G. WuirrineHam. 


SOCIETIES. 


EnromonoaicaL Society or Lonpon.—Wednesday, March 3rd, 
1909.—Dr. EF. A. Dixey, M.A., M.D., President, in the chair.—Mr. 
Francis Hamilton Lyon, of Addlestone, Surrey, was elected a Fellow 
of the Society.—Mr. L. B. Prout, on behalf of himself and Mr. A. 
Bacot, brought for exhibition a very extensive series of Acidalia 
virguiarva, Hb., bred in ten successive generations from various 
crossings of the London and Hyéres race, which had been under- 
taken with a view to the further study of Mendelism. The results 
showed non-Mendelian inheritance, there being no segregation with 
pure and hybrid forms in definite proportions, thus supporting Mr. 
Bacot’s opinion that such were only to be expected in cases of 
hybridization of forms in which Natural Selection had virtually 
eliminated intermediates. A discussion followed in which Mr. Bacot, 
Dr. T. A. Chapman, Mr. G. Meade-Waldo, and the President took 
part, Mr. A. Harrison pointing out that in similar experiments 
conducted by himself with Mr. H. Main with British Pieris napy x 
P. var. bryome from Switzerland carried through three generations, 
they had quite failed to obtain Mendelian proportions, but in the case 
of Aplecta nebulosa the Mendelian proportions were absolute.—Mr. 
H. M. Edelsten showed a living pupa of Prerzs rape attached to a 
blade of Clivia, the deep green pigment assimilating closely to the 
coloration of the leaf—Mr. R. Adkin exhibited what appeared to be 
a hybrid between Zygena filipendule and Z. achillee, taken by Mr. 
A. W. Renton in the neighbourhood of Oban, N.B.—Mr. J. W. Tutt 
expressed his opinion that the form was an aberration of Z. filipen- 
dul@, and said that in nature the two species were unknown to 
pair.—Mr. Hamilton H. Druce, F.L.8., F.E.S., communicated a 
paper ‘‘On some new and little known Hesperiide from Tropical 
West Africa.”—Mr. G. A. K. Marshall, F.Z.S., read a paper entitled 
“ Birds as a Factor in the production of Mimetic Resemblances in 
Butterflies.’ He explained that one of the chief criticisms directed 
against the theories of mimicry was to the effect that, on the whole, 
birds did not destroy butterflies to any appreciable extent; he had 
therefore collected together all the available evidence bearing on the 
question. It was contended also that the negative evidence on this 
subject, which appeared to have been very generally accepted, was 
really of very little scientific value, because in no case had it been 
shown that the observer had any adequate knowledge of the actual 


SOCIETIES. iyi 


food-habits of birds, or that any careful and exhaustive inquiry had 
been made into the subject. Instances were also cited to show how 
very easily destruction of this kind might be overlooked ; while nega- 
tive evidence derived from an examination of the contents of birds 
might be very misleading, owing to the fact that in so many instances 
the butterflies’ wings are not swallowed, so that any recognition of the 
remains becomes extremely difficult. Finally, it was urged that the 
large body of evidence resulting from merely casual observations 
indicated that the assumption that birds do not eat butterflies to any 
extent is certainly premature, and that a fuller inquiry will probably 
show it to be entirely unfounded. A discussion followed in which 
Mr. A. W. Bacot, Mr. H. Rowland-Brown, Mr. H. Main, Mr. A. E. 
Tonge, Mr. H. M. Edelsten, Mr. J. W. Tutt, and other Fellows gave 
their experiences on the subject, Mr. W. Sharpe maintaining that 
the actions of the sparrow, as a domesticated bird, was not evidence 
for conditions which exist in the case of purely natural species. Dr. 
T. A. Chapman suggested that the paucity of observations on the 
point was largely due to the shyness of birds eating in the presence 
of human beings. Mr. W. J. Kaye said that he had never observed 
birds attacking butterflies in Tropical South America, and Comman- 
der J. J. Walker gave similar testimony with regard to the many 
Australasian and other oversea localities visited by him.—H. 
RowuaAnp-Brown, M.A., Hon. Secretary. 


THe Souta Lonpon EnromonocicaL AND Naturat History 
Society.—February 11th, 1909.—Mr. A. Sich, F.E.S., President, in 
chair.—Mr. Bauman, of Chingford, was elected a member.—Mr. 
Newman exhibited portions of the stems of Viburnwm and pointed 
out the evidences showing that the larve of Ageria andreniformis 
were present. They were found in a shady locality.—Mr. Tonge, 
stereographs of the ova of Tvliacea citrago in sitt on lime twigs, and 
of Ruralis betule on sloe.—Mr. Main, a second brood specimen of 
Melampias eptphron, bred on Sept. 20th, 1908; a very light example 
of Stauropus fag from the New Forest, and a very dark form from 
Epping Forest.—Dr. Hodgson, a dark, smoky specimen of Brenthis 
selene from H. Sussex, with rayed submarginal markings.—Mr. Coote, 
bred and captured specimens of Calymnia pyralina.—Mr. R. Adkin, 
a series of Camptogramma fluviata bred from Nov. 21st to Dec. 13th 
last, from Hastbourne.—Mr. Harrison reported that the results of 
the cross breeding of the forms of Aplecta nebulosa by Mr. Mans- 
bridge, were grey x thompsoni = all robsoni and robsoni x grey = fifty 
per cent. each of these forms. A long and interesting discussion took 
place as to the oviposition and early life of the lava of the Aigeriids. 
It was noted that in the first instar the larve of several species 
were hairy and presumably external feeders. 

February 25th, 1909.—The President in the chair.—Mr. Stone, of 
Clapham, was elected a member.—Dr. Hodgson exhibited a series of 
Nemoria viridata taken in 1906-8 in Lancashire and Surrey, and 
commented on the forms shown, including ab. concavilinea. He also 
showed a third brood specimen of Celastrina argiolus in which the 
blue was almost wholly replaced by dull grey.—Mr. West (of Green- 
wich), a cabinet drawer of Coleoptera, the first of the rearrangement 
of the Society's Collection—Mr. Main, for Mr. Baldock, a yellow

variety of Huchelia jacobee from Norfolk, and three fine specimens 
of the rare Papilio mechowianus from Central Africa.—Mr. McArthur, 
specimens of Anarta cordigera from Rannoch, and read notes on its 
habits and habitat.—Mr. H. Moore, a gynandrous example of Papilio 
clearchus (?) from §. America, right side male, left side female.—Mr. 
Newman, Aglais urtice var. ichnusa with sagittate blue spots on the 
hind margin, Dryas paphia with much raised black markings, 
“black” Limenitis sibylla, a straw-coloured variety of Rwmicia 
phleas, the unique pale grey form of Smerinthus ocellatus bred by 
him in 1902, and several Nisoniades tages var. taras.—Hy. J. TURNER, 
Hon. Rep. Sec. 


Ciry or Lonpon Entomotoaicat Socrety.—February 2nd, 1909. 
—Mr. H. M. Edelsten exhibited a series of Cenobia rufa from various 
localities, including vars. lineola, pallescens, and fusca, and photo- 
graphs (by Mr. Main) of anal* processes in female used to deposit the 
ova in the central pith of rushes.—Mr. W. J. Kaye, Noctwa glareosa 
taken at sugar in Richmond Park, in Sept. 1907, also specimens from 
Sandown, Aberdeen, and Shetlands; those from the latter locality 
were very dark, save for one example intermediate between dark and 
light forms. — Mr. H. Leach, Phlogophora meticulosa taken at Rick- 
mansworth, freshly emerged on Dec. 11th.— Mr. L. A. H. Sabine, 
Dianthecia conspersa bred from Bude larvee.— Mr. A. J. Willsdon, 
three broods of Yephrosia biundularia reared in 1906. Three pups 
of the third brood went over to 1907, and the resulting imagines 
differed in appearance from the bulk of the brood, having the lines 
on wings more continuous and more clearly defined, being, in fact, 
more like the first (spring) brood.— 8. J. Brun, Hon. See. 


LANCASHIRE AND CHESHIRE ENntTomonocicaL Socrery.—Meeting 
held at the Royal Institution, Colquitt Street, Liverpool, Feb. 15th, 
1909.—Mr. C. E. Stott, Vice-President, in the chair— Mr. Charles E. 
Raven, Mr. Albert Harrison, F.C.S., F.E.S., and Mr. Hugh Main, 
B.Sc., F.E.S., were elected members of the Society.— Mr. George 
Arnold, F.E.S.. gave a lecture entitled ‘Hymenoptera.’ After out- 
lining the classification of the order Mr. Arnold passed to the Aculeates 
proper, the group Vespoidea, Konow, and gave instances from the 
life-histories of Chrysis ignita, C. osmie, and C. viridula. The 
lecturer then dealt with the ants, emphasizing the following points :— 
(1.) Division of labour, e.g. Aphenogaster, soldiers, workers-major, 
workers-minor, &amp;. (2.) Slave-making (dulosis) and probable origin 
of same, e.g. Formica sanguinea, Polyergus rufescens, and Anergates 
atrabulus. (3.) Parthenogenesis, the cytological explanation of the 
process. (4.) Myrmecophilous animals, e.g. Aphids. The following 
genera of the Fossores were described and the chief features in the 
life-cycle noted, viz. Ammophila, Sphex, Ampulex, Bembex, Philanthus, 
and Crabro. In the Diploptera, wasps, the life-history of Odynerus, 
and the peculiar tube-building to the entrance of the burrows in 
O. spinipes, were very fully discussed. The lecturer concluded with 
a review of the Anthophila, with remarks on the parasitic Antho- 
phila, such as Sphecodes, Nomada, Stelis, and Psithyrus. Mr. Arnold 
exhibited a small collection of types to illustrate his lecture. A 
discussion ensued, in which nearly all the members present took 
part.—H. R. SweetTine and Wm. Manssripan, Hon. Secs.

RAPHIDIA MACULICOLLIS. 
By Wed. Lueas;. BeA.; 2 HS: 
(PxuatE IV.) 


On April 9th last Mr. G. T. Lyle and myself found near 
Rinefield in the New Forest a living pupa evidently belonging to 
one of the species of Raphidia (Snakefly). It was discovered in 
a piece of a branch about three inches in diameter lying on the 
sround, and in a decaying condition though not in an advanced 
state of decay. The very lively pupa had its limbs and other 
appendages free, and nothing could be seen in the nature of a 
cocoon. It was about one centimeter in length and the wing- 
cases were about three millimeters long. In colour it was 
generally pale yellowish, except that the abdomen was covered 
dorsally with large brown spots symmetrically arranged, that 
the eyes were very dark, and that the jaws were brownish. 

By April 25th the pupa had become much darker than it was 
when found, at any rate on the dorsal aspect and especially 
anteriorly. It was kept in a small glass-topped box amongst 
loose bits of decaying wood, and was taken to Kingston when I 
returned on April 27th. Resting as it did on its side, in the 
semicircular position depicted on Fig. 1, it looked a peculiarly 
helpless object. In the evening of April 29th I found it had 
crawled up the side of the box and so was using its legs in the 
manner customary with insects, and therefore presented the 
dorsal aspect upwards. 

By the morning of April 30th the imago had appeared and 
the pupal skin remained attached to the side of the box. It had 
probably but lately emerged as it seemed to be rather teneral 
and its colour became darker during the day. Towards evening 
it was noticed to be running about the box in a very lively way. 
A gnat (apparently Chironomus dorsalis) was introduced into 
the box, but the snakefly appeared to be afraid of it, though the 
gnat was at length seized and the Raphidia appeared to be eating 
it. The gnat was, however, soon set free, and was only partly

crippled. If the fact that the pupa when found was much 
lighter than it afterwards became shews that it had but lately 
changed from the larval state, then the pupal condition would 
seem to last about three weeks. Possibly, however, premature 
exposure may have caused the darkening. 

Soon the snakefly was killed, as otherwise it is difficult to 
identify the species. It was then found to bea male of Raphidia 
maculicollis. Of the genus Raphidia there are four British species, 
R. notata (Fig. 3) being considerably larger than the other three 
—R. maculicollis |(Fig. 2), R. xanthostigma and R. cognata— 
which are of about the same size. They belong to the natural 
order Neuroptera, in its restricted as well as in its wider sense. 

In the Oxshott and Esher Common districts of Surrey this 
species appears to be fairly plentiful. I have met with it there as 
early as May 18th in 1901, whilst the latest date I have is June 
14th in 1906. In the Wisley district I met with one on May 23rd, 
1899. Mr. E. C. Goulton gave mea female taken near Lyndhurst 
in the New Forest in 1906, and Mr. D. Sharp gave me a Scotch 
specimen which he took at Nethy Bridge in July, 1908. Mr. 
M’Lachlan had received a specimen from Haslemere and another 
from Morayshire. So the species seems to be rather widely dis- 
tributed. On May 20th, 1908, Mr. G. T. Porritt and myself took, 
chiefly by beating, about twenty-eight individuals in some two 
hours at the Black Pond, Esher Common. Most, if not all, had 
lately emerged, and had glossy wings shewing their teneral con- 
dition. One was found on a tree-trunk near its empty pupa- 
skin, which I then met with for the first time. The wings of the 
recently disclosed imago were yellowish and clouded, like those 
of a freshly emerged dragonfly ; the joints of the body were pale 
brown, the rest of the insect being dark. One of the snakeflies 
taken that day and placed in a box with some Hemerobius 
humuli (judging by the results found afterwards) attacked two of 
the latter, killing them, and eating part of their body. 

In R. maculicollis the wing-veining near the pterostigma 
seems sufficiently constant for purposes of identification. Atten- 
tion should be paid to those cells containing a cross (Fig. 5). 
The single cell attached to the distal extremity of the ptero- 
stigma seems to be constant in this one of the four British 
species and peculiar to it. 

It should be noted that the pupa is able to work its jaws, 
though it has no cocoon to cut open.

ON THE ICHNEUMONIDA OF THE BANKSIAN 
COLLECTION IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. 


By CuaupE Mortey, F.Z.S., F.E.S., &amp;e. 


Fapricius’s connection with Sir Joseph Banks is obscure, 
but it is probable they became acquainted at the time that the 
former was working upon insects at the British Museum. This 
was previous to 1775, for many Banksian specimens were brought 
forward by him, including all the Australian ones, in ‘Systema 
Entomologiz’ of that date. In these notes, however, I have had 
before me his ‘ Species Insectorum,’ published at Hamburg and 
Kiel in 1781, and the numbers preceding each species refer to 
that work (pp. 420-442), since all were not enumerated at the 
earlier date, and such as were there instanced are again referred to 
at the later. 

Besides these, the collection contains only the types of the 
three species given by Nils 8. Swederus in his paper “ Fort- 
sittning af Beskrifningen pa 50 nya Species af Insecter”’ (Sv. 
Ak. Handl. 1787, pp. 279-281). 

The following list comprises all the specimens in the Banksian 
Collection in their order as placed, which has been preserved as 
at first received by the Museum authorities. The Collection was 
presented by the Linnean Society in 1868, and to those speci- 
mens especially referred to as typical, in the ‘ Museum Register 
of Zoological Accessions,’ I have here suffixed an asterisk.+ From 
the same source comes the information that ‘‘ the following type 
Specimens were not in the Collection when it was presented to 
the British Museum. . . . Ichnewmon melioratorius, Otaheite ; 
Cryptus nutatorius, New Holland; C. fuscator, Sandwich Isles ; 
Pimpla barbator ; and Ophion luteus, New Zealand.” 

It may be well to mention that the Antipodean insects were 
taken by Sir Joseph Banks while on his memorable voyage round 
the world with Captain Cook; most of them when the latter was 
stranded at Endeavour River, where Cooktown now stands, in 
1770, and where he had to remain for repairs for four months. 
A copy of Cook’s own sketch of the spot of beaching is in 
the library there.

This exactly corresponds with Frederick Smith’s description and 
figure of Mesostenus albopictus (Trans. Ent. Soc. 1876, p. 477, 
pl. iv. fig. 1) from New Zealand, and later recorded thence by 
Cameron ; the latter specimen, though not Smith’s type, is in 
the British Museum. The only distinction—a very strong one— 
is in the terebral length, which is not less than that of the abdo- 
men. I consider it probable that M. albopictus, Smith (Proc. 
Linn. Soe. iii. (1859), p. 172), from Key, is distinct. I cannot 
find Fabricius’s species in either the British Museum Collection 
or in Mr. Roland Turner’s extensive collection of Hymenoptera, 
in which are some twenty distinct species of Mesostenus (sensu 
lato) from Northern Queensland. Not a Cryptus, as placed by 
Dalla Torre.

Steph., ?. 

15. luctatorius.*—1 (only). Ichnewmon extensorius, Linn., 2. 

16. lotatorius.*—1. A typical-looking black female Ichnewmon 
(sensu Thoms., though it has more the facies and obtuse anus of 
Amblyteles) ; respecting colour, it is only necessary to add that 
the “‘thorace maculato”’ consists of a single callosity beneath 
the radices, that the apical angles of the third abdominal seg- 
ment are also red, with the whole legs, except coxe, trochanters, 
and extreme apices of hind femora, concolorous. It is a stout 
insect of 12 mm. in length. Undoubtedly Fitch is correct 
(Proc. Ent. Soc. 1883, p. xxxvi.) in synonymising Priocnemis 
pascoei, Kirby (Trans. Ent. Soc. 1883, p. 200, not p. 20, as given 
in ‘ Zoological Record’ et D. T.), with this species. I, like him, 
have compared the types, and find the variability he refers to 
mainly in the immaculate scutellum and radical callosities of 
I. pascoet, which also has the flagellum pale beneath; but its 
sculpture throughout is entirely identical. The seven other 
specimens referred to by him include a couple of the under- 
mentioned male, which differs little, except in also having the

third abdominal segment pale. All are from New Zealand. 
Colobacis forticornis, Cam. (Trans. New Zealand Institute, 1901, 
Xxxili. p. 110) is entirely synonymous with the above, and is 
erroneously placed by its author in the Amblypygini on the shape 
—not structure—of the abdomen. Colobacis cannot be difte- 
rentiated from Ichnewmon, Thoms. 

(‘‘ Tinctorius, Sw. MSS.”—A large Ichneumon (s. 8.) or Ambly- 
teles, with the abdomen coated with ?dirt.] 

19. vaginatorius. —1. Banchus sp., 2 (probably B. pictus, 
Fab., with the scutellar spine mutilated). ‘‘ Scutello albo” = 
apical half only ; ‘‘thorace maculato”’ = two round dots on meta- 
notum and the same on front of mesonotum, and linear cal- 
losities beneath radices; third abdominal fascia is not ‘‘ in- 
terrupta.”’ 

21. bidentorius.—1. Amblyteles armatorius, Forst., 3. 

20. annulatorius.*—1. Amblyteles palliatorius, Grav., S. I 
am not quite sure of this determination, since the head and 
front legs are missing, and the four first segments are alone 
basally black, but I have no doubt respecting the genus (cf. Ichn. 
Brit. ii. 45). 

[(‘‘ Punctatorius, Sw. MSS.”—Amblyteles oratorius, Fab., 3 .] 

32. sollicitorius.*—This male ichneumon is not, as I had at 
first sight expected, the male of I. lotatorius (ante, No. 16), but of 
the somewhat closely allied J. invectus, Smith (Trans. Ent. 
Soc. 1876, p. 475), as the sculpture of the metanotum at once 
proclaims. Consequently both Fabrician titles stand, with, as 
its author originally suspected, and I have little doubt is the 
case, I. insidiator, Smith (l.c. p. 476, nec Tischb.) as male of 
I. lotatorius. There is a small series of both sexes in the 
General Collection in British Museum. Hutton (Cat. New Zeal. 
Dipt. 1881, p. 120) is the only author who has mentioned 
I. sollicitorius since 1824. 

[(‘‘Ferrugator, Act. Holm. 1787, p. 280.” — Two females, 
marked with a type-label, as though they had passed from 
Swederus, who first described the species (loc. cit. vill. pl. iv. 
fig. 2), through the hands of Fabricius to the Banksian cabinet. 
Both sexes of this species, which I am inclined to regard asa 
Melanichneumon on account of its hexagonal areola, were re- 
described by Cresson (Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc. 1877, p. 208). It 
is entirely distinct from Ichnewmon ferrugator, Kirby, Fauna 
Bor.-Amer. iv. (1887), p. 258, the type of which does not appear 
to be in the British Museum.+t] 


+ I am not aware that Oryptocentrum lineolatum, Kirby, has been 
mentioned in literature since the erection of both genus and species in the 
above work in 1887 (pl. vi. fig. 1). Ihave discovered the type of this species 
in the General Collection of the British Museum, where are three others of 
which two are labelled ‘‘ Georgia,’ and the third, received in 1844, from 
Albany River, Hudson’s Bay, bears the MS. name ‘“ Pimpla Annulata.”

whatever in common with T'ryphon rutilator, L.- 

88. vigilator.*—1. It superficially resembles and is possibly 
congeneric with Automalus alboguttatus, Gray., though very dis- 
tinct in many particulars; it is not, as I at first anticipated, 
Catadelphus nigrocyaneus, Tosquinet, Ichn. d’Afrique (Mém. Soc.

specimen under this label is a typical female of T'rogus exalta- 
torius, Panz. In any case, it is extremely improbable that any

Stutton (Cat. New Zeal. Dipt. 1881, p. 123) and Fabricius in 
1804, for the type is a female, and has no mesopleural sulci. It 
is certainly referable to the genus Platylabus, and is allied in 
coloration to P. rufus, Wesm. ‘The only, and entirely, black 
fourth segment recalls the similar band of Pezomachus fasct- 
atus, Fab. ‘‘ Ultimo segmento fascia atra”’ is a very loose 
phrase. 

40. caudator.*—A female Lissonota (or possibly Syzeuctus, 


doubt, though the areolet—as described by Kirby—is entirely wanting in one 
specimen. I have seen thence no female, to which sex the original specimen 
was erroneously referred, but have little hesitation in entirely synonymising

(? more usually Oriental) form, not uncommon in India, having 
the hind tibie with no black markings.

‘“‘ Habitat in Insula Otaheiti. Mus. Dom. Banks.” This is the 
type of Swederus’s species (Sv. Ak. Handl. 1787, p. 279) ; it has 
not been mentioned in literature since 1790, and is allowed to 
remain in its original genus by Dalla Torre in 1902. In the 
Banksian Collection it is placed in Bassus (as understood by 
Fabricius, nec Fallén) ; but the type differs from Holmgren’s 
Pimplid genus Hchthromorpha solely in lacking the apical alar 
infumescence. It is congeneric with both Pimpla variegata, 
Brullé, and Chrysopimpla ornatipes, Cam. An analogous speci-

(Ichn. d’Afrique, 248). It is recorded from Togoland, the Came- 
roons, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and the Congo ; from the last 
locality Miss E. M. Sharpe presented five Hymenoptera to the 
British Museum in 1890, of which one female belongs to the 
present species, thus fixing its locality.

description (Hist. Ins. Hym. iv. 81) is accurate as far as it goes. 
The economy of this species is outlined by F. H. Chittenden 
(‘ Insect Life,’ v. (1893), p. 247; cf. iii. p. 461). It is said to be 
ektoparasitic upon larve of the Longicorn beetle, Leiopus varie- 
gatus, Hald. No male has yet been assigned to it; the female, 
as is usual in the genus, is probably much the commoner sex. 

104. punctatus.*+—1 ¢; ‘‘ Habitat in Coromandel.” This is 
quite certainly the Pimpla ceylonica of Peter Cameron (Manch. 
Mém. 1899, p. 165), for I have compared the types inter se and 
find them to agree ad amussim. The latter author is incorrect 
in supposing Krieger’s description of Xanthopimpla punctata (Bey. 
Nat. Ges. Leipzig, 1899, p. 101) to appertain to a distinct species. 
The fault lies entirely in the Fabrician diagnosis. 

74. extensor.—1. Glypta sculpturata, Grav., 2. Fabricius 
refers the species to Linneus and Geoffroy, but it is impossible

Walckenaer (Fauna Paris. 1802, p. 60), or Latreille (Hist. Crust. 
et Ins. 1805, p.180; cf. Grav. Ichn. Europ. 1829, iii. pp. 980-1). 
And the name has hitherto been, and still should continue to be, 
applied to Ephialtes extensor, Tasch. (Zeits. Ges. Nat. 1863, 
p- 255), which I have recently been enabled to add to the British 
fauna through the kindness of E. A. Cockayne, Esq., who took 
it in Kensington Gardens in 1908 (cf. also Marsham, Trans. 
Linn. Soc. 1797, p. 23). 

77. strobilell (labelled ‘‘ Ichn. strobionelle ? Fabr. Sp. Ins.

his ‘ Piezata’ of 1804, p. 85, under the name Cryptus fuscator, as 
having only the front pair of legs red, with a black mark before

are from Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire; Orisaba, 
Jalapa, and elsewhere in Mexico. Strangely enough, it is not 
included in ‘ Biologia Centrali- Americana,’ i. (1883-1900), p. 288, 
although in the representative collection of that work are two 
females bearing (Mr. Champion tells me certainly) the MS. label,

its entire lack of areolet at once testifies. My knowledge of the 
Ophionine is not sufficient to enable me to name the single 
female in the collection, and I can but superficially describe it as 
a medium-sized Anomalon with the hind tarsi not spatuliform ; 
the abdomen, with the exception of the second segment discally, 
is centrally red, and both thorax and scutellum are entirely black. 
It cannot, I think, be the J. falcator of Ent. Syst.

ACROLITA CONSEQUANA, H.-8., IN DEVON, WITH 
STRAY NOTES ON ITS HABITS, &amp;c. 


By Eustace R. Banges, M.A., F.E.S., &amp;c. 


Wirth reference to Mr. C. Granville Clutterbuck’s note (antea, 
p. 100) chronicling the discovery in South Devon, in July, 1907, 
of larve of Acrolita consequana, from which seven imagines 
were bred in the following month, it may be of interest to record 
the fact that I took this species in South Devon as long ago as 
August 18th, 1900. The moth being abundant throughout my 
visit, which terminated early in September, a nice series was 
secured, and either it or the larva has proved equally common 
in the other years in which the same locality has been explored. 
I also bred it in plenty, July 1st—August 27th, 1902, from 
larvee of all sizes collected there in the latter half of September, 
1901, and have distributed some of these Devonshire specimens, 
with full data, among various friends. 


138 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


The species has been recorded as double-brooded in Hants 
(Vict. Hist. Hamps. 147) as well as in Dorset (Prac. Hints, ii. 
84), with reference to which counties Meyrick (H. B. Brit. Lep. 
505) enters the first brood as appearing in May, and the second 
in July and August. The moths reared by Mr. Clutterbuck from 
South Devon on August 6th obviously belonged to at least a 
second brood, since the larve that produced them were found 
feeding in July, and the fact that my imagines of the first brood, 
bred from the same coast, only emerged in July and August 
was doubtless due to the larve and pupe being kept in a very 
cool place. I have taken the perfect insect on many dates in 
September, and having then noted it as common at the same 
time that larve of all sizes were abundant, think it not unlikely 
that there is, throughout the summer and early autumn, a 
constant succession of broods, with much overlapping, and no 
marked intervals between them. In any case, the probability of 
the occurrence of, at any rate, a third brood in South Devon is 
suggested by my having met with the imago in some numbers, 
and in fine condition, on September 24th—26th, and having 
captured in sugar, in 1906, a good example of the female as late 
as October 15th. 

The moth has frequently shown itself to be possessed of “‘a 
sweet tooth” by visiting this bait at some distance from its 
haunts, generally only in odd individuals, but more or less com- 
monly at times. When the weather conditions are favour- 
able it flies freely during the evening—not only ‘‘at dusk,” as 
stated by Wilkinson (Brit. Tort. 187 (1859) )— but is very difficult 
to net, its protective colour and rapid dashing flight preventing 
the eye from following it against the background of sand and 
shingle in which its food-plant grows. 

In my experience, the larva, when feeding in the autumn, 
gradually constructs, as a rule, a well protected gallery, of 
remarkable length, up the exterior of the stem of the shoot, by 
joining together with silk the leaves that grow thereon and 
drawing them in towards the stem; it works its way upward by 
degrees, and, as it progresses, eats out the contents of the 
indrawn leaves, whose bleached appearance then attracts instant 
attention to the situation of the larval gallery. It has often 
been observed devouring the seeds, but I do not happen to have 
found it feeding in this manner. A. consequana hybernates as 
a full-fed larva, spun up in an opaque dirty-ochreous cocoon 
formed of tough silk, and normally pupates therein in the 
spring, though some of my larve cannot well have done so 
before July. In confinement, certain individuals spun their 
_ cocoons among the pieces of the plant, whilst others fixed them 
against the bottom or sides of the cotton bag in which they 
were imprisoned; they seemed particularly fond of attaching to 
the outside of the cocoon any minute pebbles that could be 


TORTRICES NEAR LIVERPOOL. 139 


found, and from this it is reasonable to assume that, in nature, 
the cocoons are spun amongst, and coated with, the coarse sand 
that surrounds the food-plant. This is Huphorbia paralias in 
South Devon, to which district my acquaintance with the insect 
is limited, and also in Hayling Island, as we learn from Wilkin- 
son (l.c.), but in the Isle of Portland EH. portlandica has been 
proven to be the chosen plant. 

The examination of a large number of bred imagines shows 
that the females average somewhat smaller, and rather paler, 
than the males. My largest examples of the former expand 
16 mm., while those of the latter measure 14 mm., and in 
smaller specimens there is about the same proportional differ- 
ence in size between the sexes. The smallest individual known 
to me is one of my bred Devonshire males that has an expanse 
of only just 10 mm. From the numerous observations that I 
made with regard to the hour of emergence, one learns that 
seventy-two per cent. of the moths left the pupa between 
6.30 a.m. and 1 p.m., the rest showing no special predilection for 
any one period of either day or night over another.

TORTRICES NEAR LIVERPOOL IN _ 1907-8. 
By W. Manssripes, F.E.S. 


Azout twenty species of the Tortricina, not met with in our 
localities by myself previously, have been captured or bred in 
the last two years. 

Tortric crategana from Knowsley and Simonswood; the 
former being a yellow form. I also saw this moth in some 
numbers at Delamere Forest, but it was worn at the end of July 
when it was found. ‘’. unifasciana is generally darker from the 
mosses than from Wallasey. An addition to the local lists is 
T. cinnamomeana. This moth was quite common in 1907 on 
Kirkby Moss, and last year a single specimen was netted in 
Delamere Forest. T’. corylana seems generally distributed, but 
only odd specimens have fallen to my share at St. Helens, 
Simonswood, and Delamere Forest. I met with 7. viburnana in 
some numbers at Whitegate Heath, males only, the first week in 
July. TT. forsterana.—This is another moth that seems to be 
darker at Simonswood than at Wallasey or near Leeds. The 
beautiful and very common little moth Peronea variegana is 
everywhere found on the whitethorn hedges. ‘The South Lan- 
cashire forms seem to be confined to vars. borana, cirrana, asper- 
ana and type, with var. albana rarely; some of the cirrana forms 
are a very lovely dark blackish purple. I have not taken the 
extreme form at Wallasey. In April, 1907, I found a pair of 


140 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


hybernated P. hastiana in copula at Formby. This is mentioned 
because I believe the spring habits of this extremely abundant 
species are little understood. Personally I have never found it 
after hybernation except on this occasion. A nice series of 
Teras contaminana var. dimidiana was bred from larve found at 
Crosley when arranging for our summer field-meeting. Nearly 
all were extremely dark, though of this form. Dictyopteryx 
forskaleana has been found in some numbers at Wallasey by 
Mr. C. B. Williams among sycamore, and I took a specimen at 
Kirkby last August. When at Crosby last June, I found a 
number of larve on iris and ranunculus; these turned out to be 
Lortriz costana, a large and handsome species. Penthina varie- 
gana has shown up in odd specimens from various localities, and 
if worked for would be found commonly. P. dimidiana I have 
only found at Simonswood occasionally ; in 1907 I bred two or 
three from larve beaten from birch the previous autumn. Anti- 
thesia acerian4a, one specimen at Sefton Park in 1907. Sericoris 
bifasciana, also one specimen from Delamere, July, 1908. Cne- 
phasia musculana, one from Delamere, May, 1907. Sciaphila 
pascuana, although not noted previous to 1907, has since occurred 
at Delamere and Simonswood, not uncommonly. Clepsis rusti- 
cana was new to my collection when I captured a few specimens 
at Kirkby Moss in pine or among sweet gale. In a clump of 
rushes, only about a square yard altogether, on Kirkby Moss, 
Bactra lanceolana was quite common in August, 1908, and a few 
rather dark specimens were taken at Hatchmere last July, where 
it is no doubt common. A specimen of Phoxopteryx lundana 
came to light at Sefton Park in August 1907, and P. mitter- 
pacheriana occurred at Delamere, in May, 1907. The imago 
was found sitting on birch leaves. 

When looking for C. flavicornis at Simonswood in April, 
1907, and also at Delamere the same year, I gathered all the 
distorted catkins from the birches that I could find; later these 
produced a fine series of Graphiolitha ramella type and var. 
costana in about equal proportions, though perhaps in the Dela- 
mere series the type slightly outnumbered the variety. A nice 
series of G. nevana was bred from holly tips collected uear 
Liverpool in 1908, and a few G. geminana from Vaccinium found 
at Delamere; on the same ground in July this species was 
abundant, flying freely when disturbed in the daytime. 

Among the pines at Simonswood in 1907 I found a moth 
that at first seemed familiar, but at the time I could not recog- 
nize it; on comparison at home, however, it turned out to be a 
very dusky form of the male of Batodes angustiorana; it was so 
dark as to suggest the possibility of a black form parallel to the 
var. fuscana of T’. podana. The locality is likely, and a black form 
is one that might reasonably be expected to occur, hence I shall 
look out for it every season if I can get there at the proper 


ON THE NEUROPTEROUS GENUS RAPHIDIA. 141 


time. Pedisca bilunaria oceurs at Kirkby Moss in fair numbers ; 
the series taken last year is considerably darker than my 
southern set from Wimbledon Common. P. solandriana, always 
abundant among birch, occurred in its usual numbers. I gene- 
rally get the scarcer forms best by breeding from Delamere 
larve. Heusimene jfimbriana was a very pleasing capture in 
April, 1907, when I got a single specimen at Delamere; subse- 
quent search for it at the same place has been unsuccessful. At 
the same time and locality Coccyx argyrana was abundant on 
the oaks. 

Perhaps the red-letter record among the Tortrices for 1908 
was the capture of a beautiful specimen of Stigmonota pygmeana ; 
it was beaten from spruce fir in Delamere Forest, one very cold 
day in April. 

At Wallasey, in July, Dicrorampha petiverella was common, 
and a few D. politana also occurred, both flying swifty in the hot 
sunshine. At the same time I was pleased to find that the 
efforts of the golfers have not quite exterminated the very local 
Rhodaria sanguinalis, very close work producing three fair 
examples. D. saturnana is represented by one specimen from a 
garden wall near Sefton Park, Liverpool; probably some tansy 
was growing in the garden on the other side. Mupecilia nana 
occurred at Knowsley and at Simonswood Moss in fair numbers ; 
E. maculosana, one specimen, at Knowsley in 1907. A second 
brood of H. dubitana was noted at Crosby sandhills in Septem- 
ber, 1907, and at the same time Catoptria expallidana, which 
must have been a second brood, was abundant.

ON THE NEUROPTEROUS GENUS RAPHIDIA, Lriyy. 
By CriaupeE Mortey;, F.E.S., F.Z.S. 


One so rarely meets with mention of this genus in periodical 
literature, and Mr. Lucas tells me that so little is known respect- 
ing it that it may not be out of place to offer a few remarks 
from my own experience, very scanty though it be. These 
insects are remarkable for the peculiar elongation of the pro- 
thorax into a snake-like neck bearing a narrow and vicious- 
looking head, and when handled they pose the latter in a terrific 
ophidian manner, as was noted by Kirby and Spence (Introd. 
7th ed. 6), while De Geer says they then eject a drop of brown 
and fetid liquid from their ‘‘ proboscis’’( Mém. ii. 734), though 
his allusion is more probably to the allied genus Panorpa. The 
genus consists of very few species, all of which are confined 
to the Palearctic region; in Britain we have but four, which 


142 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


may still be differentiated by the characters given by Dr. Hagen 
(Ent. Ann. 1858, p. 30), though his A. londinensis, Steph. is 
now considered a mere variety of R. xanthostigma, whose sub- 
radial nervures are often irregular ; in fact, I possess a specimen 
exhibiting the characters of both forms in its alternate wings. 

R. xanthostigma, Schum.—I have captured but four examples 
of this species, which I consider distinctly rare. Two females 
are from a dry and sandy part of Brandon in Suffolk, and were 
taken on 10th and 11th June, 1899; the one beaten from the 
branch of a dead and large oak-tree, and the other found 
beneath dead and rotten oak-bark, along with such subcortical 
beetles as Hypophleus bicolor and Thanasimus formicarius. The 
other pair, on the contrary, occurred in an extremely wet part of 
Tuddenham Fen, some twelve miles distant, on 6th June, 1903, 
when a male was beaten from a large live sallow-tree, and 19th 
June, 1901, when I detected a female settled on the leaf of a 
well-grown water-dock; I remember that it took to flight as I 
approached it through the ooze. 

R. cognata, Rbr.—This is evidently extremely rare. The 
only example of which I have heard was captured in Foxley 
Wood, Norfolk, in June, 1886, by my friend Mr. H. J. Thouless, 
and is in the collection of McLachlan, who had not seen a 
specimen less than sixty years old (cf. H.M.M. 1900, p. 268). 

R. -maculicollis, Steph.—Apparently confined to the New 
Forest, where it is by no means uncommon. I beat a female 
from hawthorn blossom at Brockenhurst, 26th May, 1895 
(E.M.M. 1895, p. 198), and on the previous day took another 
with aberrant neuration at Holmsley Marsh. In the middle of 
June, 1907, I found both sexes sparingly at Wilverley Inclosure, 
Matley Bog, and Denny Wood, though in nothing like the pro- 
fusion stated at H.M.M. 1894, p. 189. 

R. notata, Fab.—Our last indigenous species is the only one 
with any claims to frequency or general distribution; it pro- 
bably occurs in all the ancient-timbered districts southerly from 
the Midlands. In the New Forest it has occurred to me on live 
oak-trees, sitting on bracken, and lying dead upon water at 
Brockenhurst, Lyndhurst and Wilverley, in May, 1895 and June, 
1907. In Suffolk I have beaten the female from birch in 
Assington Thicks, on 21st May, 1899, and from bushes in the 
Bentley Woods on 15th June, 1895. But though I constantly 
worked the latter locality from 1893 to 1904, I saw no more 
imagines. On 20th July, 1900, the head, &amp;c., of a larva were 
detected beneath the bark of comparatively new pine railings 
there. 

Concerning the life-history of this species, Mr. G. T. Lyle 
has recently (Entom. 1908, p. 238) described the eggs from the 
New Forest; they are probably laid in the crevices of bark. 
Respecting the larva, I quote from my diary of 5th November, 


ON THE NEUROPTEROUS GENUS RAPHIDIA. 1438 


1900: ‘‘ Found a larva of Raphidia sp. in burrows in holly, a 
solid old stem with the bark not very firmly affixed. This larva 
was quite healthy and lively on 5th March, 1901. It had just 
become a nymph in no enveloping case on 20th April, 1901. It 
appeared to attain greater degrees of activity the nearer it 
approached maturity. On May 4th it was able to hold on toa 
piece of wood with its pupal legs, move its abdomen and head 
freely in a vertical direction. On May 6th a female R. notata 
emerged; it had just evacuated its nymph skin at 10 a.m. and 
the wings were already of normal length, but the wings, legs, 
ovipositor, antennx, clypeus, and cibaria were quite pellucid- 
white, the abdomen and thorax were red, the head and two 
apical tarsal joints being the only black parts. The insect took 
till 4 p.m. to attain perfection, and did not move a fraction of an 
inch the whole time; the day was normally warm, damp and 
dull. The nymph itself had crawled to a horizontal position 
in its box, where, however, it was not very firmly attached, as on 
the box being jarred it fell to the bottom. The larva had 
gnawed a narrow and shallow ridge in the very hard holly-wood 
enclosed with it during the winter.” 

Waterhouse says (Trans. Ent. Soc. i.) that the larva of this 
genus lives in the bark, and Westwood suggests that this was be- 
cause they were preparing a retreat for their pupation, believing 
them from the oral structure to be predacious. Mclachlan says 
(E.M.M. 1894, p. 186) that they are found in dead wood and 
under bark; he kept one larva: ‘‘it is fed occasionally with a 
fly, and seems to thrive; I suspect it feeds at night, for 1 have 
never been able to detect it in the act’’; nor does he say that 
the flies were actually devoured. At all events my larva had 
nothing but a ligneous diet from November to May! 

A further examination of the larva-skin reveals that the 
nymph probably emerged from the castaneous, hard and chiti- 
nous prothorax, which is split longitudinally throughout its 
disc, as also is the basal portion of the similarly conformed 
head as far as the region occupied in the imago by the ocelli ; 
the dull white larval abdomen appears to have been shuffled off 
and in no way fractured; it is now strongly curled ventrally. 
Its mandibles have the apex much more elongate and acuminate 
- than is figured by Westwood (Mod. Class. 1i. 56, Fig. Ixvi. 9), 
with the inner basal tooth much more prominent and sub- 
rectangular. The cast nymph-skin, carded when soft, is trans- 
parent, flavescent, and 12 mm. in length; all the members, in- 
cluding the antenne and remarkably short recurved terebra, are 
perfectly free, and the hind legs are in no way impeded by the 
wings, which in the nymph measure 5 mm., and in the imago, 
which emerged from it, 18 mm. in length.

margin; wings dusky, nervures black; abdomen with entire orange- 
fulvous hair bands on the apical margins of the segments ; last dorsal 
segment with black bristles; ventral scopa bright orange-fulvous, 
white basally, black on last segment. 


With the females comes a male, assumed to be conspecific :— 


3. Hair of head and thorax above mixed black and white, not 
ochreous; hair-bands of abdomen white, with coarse black hair on the 
discs between them ; antennz slender, black; wings strongly dusky ; 
anterior tarsi simple ; anterior coxee without spines; claws cleft, the 
inner tooth the smaller; carina of sixth abdominal segment jagged, 
with little truncate spines or teeth, three or four on each side, the 
median interval rounded, but not especially large; no subapical 
spines or teeth beneath. 


Hab. Hinterland of Benguella, January 38rd, 1908, female 
type (Wellman) ; Ekuiva Valley, five females, one male; two of 
the females at flowers of Composite (Wellman). 


This little species is related to M. caricina, Ckll., but is 
smaller, and easily distinguished in the female by the mainly 
pale ochreous hair of the scutellum (that of caricina being coarse 
and black) and the orange-fulvous abdominal hair-bands. The 
male differs conspicuously in the jagged carina of sixth abdo- 
minal segment. M. venusta, Smith, judging by the description, 
seems to have many points of resemblance, but the abdominal 
bands are white in venusta, and the scopa is not black apically. 
Even closer resemblance may be found in M. cordata, Smith, 
from Natal, but Smith makes no mention of any black or fuscous 
hair on the dorsal surface.

NOTE ON EVETRIA (RETINIA) BUOLIANA, Scutrr., 
anD E. PINICOLANA, Dsup. 


By Evstace R. Banxess, M.A., F.E.S., &amp;e. 


In the Editorial review [Entom. xli. 255-256 (1908)] of Mr. 
A. J. Gillanders’ ‘Forest Entomology’ we read, on p. 256, 
‘The species represented on p. 269, fig. 256, is certainly Retinia 
buoliana, but moths bred from larve feeding in the leading 
shoots of Scots pine, as illustrated (fig. 255), are usually R. pint- 
colana....” This latter assertion is perhaps true of certain 
districts, but it would be interesting to learn what evidence can 
be adduced in support of it as a general statement. At different 
times I have collected, in various localities in Hast Dorset and 
West Hants, large numbers of Evetria larve feeding in the 
leading shoots of Scots pine, precisely as shown in the illustra- 
tion (fig. 255) in question, and have reared scores of imagines 
from them, every one of which, with the exception of a single 
pinicolana bred from among some Ringwood larve, has been refer- 
able to buoliana. Wherever plantations of Scots pine are found 
in this part of the country, buoliana seems to be either common 
or abundant, whereas pinicolana is so exceedingly local that a 
spot in the Isle of Purbeck, where I discovered it in 1901, is 
still its only known Dorset habitat except for one which has 
yielded a solitary individual. Moreover, even where the two 
species occur together, buoliana is, in my experience, by far the 
more plentiful, and this is the case in all districts about which I 
have definite information, though it will be sufficient to quote 
from only the three authors first to hand. In the course of his 
valuable notes on “ The Tortrices of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex,” 
the late Mr. Walter P. Weston wrote in Entom. xiii. 160 (1880), 
“ Retinia buoliana, Schiff—Common among various kinds of 


HESe &lt;3 5 It occurs throughout these counties. Retinia pini- 
colana, Dbld.—Of similar habits to the preceding species, but 
much scarcer. .... It has occurred at Tunbridge Wells, 


Dartford; Hastings, Uckfield, Tilgate Forest ; Croydon, West 
Wickham.” In the. catalogue of Lepidoptera published in the 
‘Victoria History of Hampshire,’ the notices of these species 
‘were from the pen of Mr. W. H. B. Fletcher, and run as 
follows: ‘‘ Retinia buoliana. Abundant in plantations of young 
Scotch firs in New Forest. Retinia pinicolana. less common 
by far than the preceding in New Forest.” Again, Mr. A. 
Thurnall, in his “ List of Tortrices taken in South Hssex 
between 1885 and 1901,” published in Entom. xxxv. (1902), 
sums up his experience as follows, on p.191: ‘‘ Retinia buohana, 
Schiff.—Very common wherever Pinus sylvestris grows, ... . 
R. pinicolana, Doubl.—Much rarer than the last species ; singly

in Wanstead Park, Warley, and Blackmore at rest on P. syl- 
vestris.”’ 

Seeing that both species feed in exactly the same way, and 
that EH. buoliana, as both Mr. Fletcher and I have learned to 
our disappointment, is certainly no less fond than its close ally 
of the leading shoots of the Scots pine, and is infinitely more 
numerous than it in each of the six English counties mentioned 
above, one is certainly justified in asking for some proof of the 
accuracy of the reviewer’s statement.

DESCRIPTIONS OF TWO NEW SPECIES OF MUTILLA 
FROM KUCHING, BORNEO. 


By P. Cameron. 


Mutilla annexa, sp. nov. 


Black, the basal two abdominal segments and the basal fourth 
of the third, red; the head and thorax densely covered with white 
pubescence, the metanotum being also covered with a white de- 
pressed pile; the base of abdomen sparsely covered with white hair ; 
the apex of the second, third, and middle of fourth fringed with 
longish white hair; the sides of the third and the apices of the 
following segments thickly fringed with stiff black hair. Wings 
almost hyaline, the nervures black; the first abscissa of radius 
straight, obliquely sloped, about one-fourth longer than the second, 
which is a little shorter than the third; the first transverse cubital 
nervure rounded, oblique; the second broadly rounded outwardly ; 
the first transverse cubital nervure is received very shortly before the 
middle of the cellule. Tegule black on the inner side, the outer 
(and larger) part rufo-testaceous. Keel on basal ventral segment 
straight. Pygidium rather strongly and closely punctured. ¢. 
Length, 9 mm. 


Kuching, Borneo (John Hewitt, B.A.). 


Vertex on either side of the ocellar region finely, closely, obliquely 
striated; the ocellar region smooth, raised; bordered by a narrow 
furrow. Front sparsely punctured; a smooth, shallow furrow down 
the lower half. Antennal scape furrowed below, the sides of the 
furrow keeled. The basal two joints of the flagellum are not much 
longer than the third united. Occiput broadly rounded. Pro- and 
mesothorax strongly, but not very closely punctured ; the scutellum 
is more coarsely rugosely punctured. Metanotum reticulated; the 
basal area has the apical half narrowed, about half the length of the 
basal part ; the bordering keels are more or less curved. 


Allied to M. attila, Cam.; the latter is a larger species, has 
the wings distinctly dark fuscous, the tegule black, the basal 
abscissa of the radius is curved, not straight, the first recur-

rent nervure is received beyond the middle of the cellule, and 
the area on the base of metanotum is almost of equal width 
throughout. 

Mutilla devia, sp. nov. 


Black; the head, thorax (the pronotum and the mesopleure 
densely), the apices of the abdominal segments and the legs covered 
with longish white pubescence; the wings hyaline, the nervures 
black; the first abscissa of the radius straight, sharply oblique, about 
one-fourth shorter than the following two united, the second about 
one-fourth longer than the third; the first recurrent nervure is 
received in the middle of the cellule. Tegule dark testaceous at the 
base, the apex white; they are covered with white pubescence. Keel 
on basal ventral abdominal segment distinctly dilated at the apex. 3. 
Length, 7 mm. 


Kuching, Borneo (John Hewitt, B.A.). 


Vertex on either side of the ocellar region finely, closely, longi- 
tudinally striated, sparsely covered with longish black hair; the front 
densely covered with silvery pubescence. Pronotum closely, the 
mesonotum less closely, but more strongly punctured; there are two 
distinct furrows near the centre of the apical half of the mesonotum. 
Scutellum more closely, rugosely punctured than the mesonotum. 
The space bordering the scutellums and the base of the metanotum 
densely covered with depressed silvery pubescence. There is no 
clearly defined area on the base of the metanotum unless it is hidden 
by the dense pubescence; the metanotum is rather coarsely reticu- 
lated. Calcaria white. Third antennal joint about dne-quarter 
longer than the fourth. 


THREE NEW ANTHOPHORID BEES FROM TEXAS. 
By T. D. A. CockERELL. 


Tetralonia argyrophila, sp. nov. 


3. Length about 134 mm., black, with the hair on the head, 
thorax, and basal segment of abdomen (covering the latter densely) 
ochreous, rather bright on the thorax above. Clypeus bright lemon- 
yellow, the yellow angularly incised laterally ; labrum cream-colour 
with a narrow black edge; mandibles without any yellow spot; 
antenns very long, entirely black; third joint very short, its shorter 
(anterior side) about as long as its apical breadth antero-posteriorly ; 
mesothorax dull, densely punctured; area of metathorax rugose; legs 
with pale hair, that on inner side of basitarsi light orange; middle 
tarsi not distorted; hind spur of hind tibiz normal; abdomen beyond 
the first segment shining black with sparse black hair, but with scat- 
tered long silvery-white hairs, becoming numerous toward the apex, 
and forming a sort of thin fringe on the sides of segments four to six ; 
apical margin of sixth and sides of seventh with short light hair. In 
my table in Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc. 1906, this runs to 4 on p. 79, and 
does not precisely fall in either category there indicated. On the whole

it runs nearest to 7’. edwardsw (Cresson), to which it has a very strong 
superficial resemblance, differing, however, by the black hair on the 
basal part of the second abdominal segment (although that segment 
has some light hair subapically), the brilliant silvery hairs on the 
apical part of the abdomen, and the shorter third antennal joint. The 
last two characters also separate it from 7’. acerba (Cresson). There 
is no light band on the fifth segment, such as is seen in 7’. edwardsiz 
vagabunda, Ckll. In some respects 7’. argyrophila closely resembles 
T. fedoris, Ckll., from the same region, but the apical part of the 
abdomen is very different, and the wings have none of the dusky 
yellowish tint of fedorvs. 


Hab. Lee County, Texas, March 24th (Birkmann, No. 16). 


Melissodes masuca, sp. nov. 


3. Length about 114 mm., black, with ochreous pubescence, be- 
coming bright yellowish red on the thorax above. No black hair on 
head or thorax. Head rather broad; eyes dark reddish; clypeus 
(except the two black spots), labrum, and large spots on base of 
mandibles yellow; antennz long, flagellum black above, clear ferru- 
ginous below ; third joint broader than long ; mesothorax with strong 
punctures ; tegule clear ferruginous; wings dusky, nervures rather 
dilute brown ; legs ordinary, apex of middle and most of hind tibiz 
ferruginous ; abdomen with continuous bands; hind margin of first 
segment rather narrowly whitish hyaline, of the others broadly and 
suffusedly dark reddish brown; segments two to five with broad 
basal bands of ochreous tomentum; second with also an entire 
straight median band; sixth segment with black hair; seventh with 
lateral red teeth. In the table in Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc., 1906, this 
runs to 8 on p. 81; it also runs to that vicinity (-e. of M. awrigenia 
and agilis) in Robertson’s table in Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc., 1905. It 
differs from M. trinodis, Rob., by the yellow on mandibles and other 
characters; from M. agilis and various other species it is readily 
known by the entire narrow median band (separated from the basal 
one by a black exposed area) on the second segment. In colour and 
general appearance (except for the much longer antenne) it is curi- 
ously like an undersized M. suffusa, Cress., but the distribution of 
hair on the second abdominal segment and other characters are 
entirely different. 

Hab. Fedor, Texas, June 17th, 1901 (Birkmann, No. 17). 
The name means golden-haired in a dialect of Ceram. 


Melissodes loena, sp. n. 


g. Length about 12 mm.; hair of thorax, &amp;¢., ochreous, but not 
quite so bright as in M. masuca; clypeus (except the spots), labrum, 
and large spot on mandibles yellow ; flagellum black above, clear fer- 
ruginous beneath ; tegulze shining ferruginous ; nervures fuscous. In 
the characters of the head, thorax, &amp;c., this is almost the same as M. 
masuca ; were the abdomen removed, it would be hard to separate 
them. The maxillary blade is shorter in loena, the tegule are shining 
(dull in masuea), and the hind tibia is more slender, less densely

covered with hair, and red only at the apex. The venation is dis- 
tinctly darker. The abdomen is conspicuously different, being nar- 
rower, with the hair-bands white. The hind margins of the segments 
are more transparent, so that the basal hair-bands can be seen through 
them. The first segment is very strongly punctured. From M, 
kallstremie phenacoides, Ckll., this is readily known by the greyish- 
red (instead of green) eyes, the dark venation, the shorter tongue, 
the much less hairy hind tibia, and the white hair-band on seg- 
ment five. 

Hab. Lee County, Texas, November, 1908 (Birkmann, 
No. 15). The name loena is derived from a Malay word re- 
ferring to flowers.

THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITAA. 


By Rev. Grorezk WHEE ER, M.A., F.E.S. 
(Continued from p. 115.) 


We must now pass to the named forms of other species than 
athalia, though it may be well to note in passing that Aurivillius 
in the ‘Nordens Fjarilar’ treats both aurelia and parthenie 
(called by him parthenie and parthenoides respectively) as 
varieties of athalia, on the ground of their mutual resemblance 
and specific variability. It is possible that this use of the name 
parthenie for aurelia elsewhere may account for the apparent 
confusion between the two species in many German authors, a 
confusion so great as often to leave one in doubt as to how many 
of the latter really know parthenie at all, a doubt which more 
rarely assails one when dealing with French or Swiss writers. 

Deione var. berisalensis has already been somewhat fully dealt 
with, and the resemblance between the Swiss and the southern 
Spanish forms touched upon. I have, in fact, specimens from 
South Spain which I should certainly have supposed to come 
from Martigny, though they are perhaps slightly lighter in 
ground colour and the x-mark is not so defined as is usual in 
the more northern specimens. To my mind this resemblance 
appeals as a further confirmation of the specific identity of the 
two forms, and should they ever be proved to be distinct, the 
Southern Spanish race will have to be united with berisalensis 
and not with deione. It should perhaps be noted that Freyer’s 
deione ( ‘ Netiere Beitriige,’ vi. p. 21, pl. 493, fig. 1, 1852) is merely 
a small specimen of parthenie, which accounts for his unwilling- 
ness to allow it specific rank, as he was evidently unacquainted 
with the real insect. 

There appear to be three named forms of parthenie, viz. : 
aphea (Freyer nec Hubner), which has already been described 
(antea, p. 57), jordisi, Ruhl, and beata, Caradja. 


150 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Var. jordisi is described at great length by Ruhl in the 
‘Palaearktischen Grossschmetterlinge,’ p. 413 (1893); the 
description is, in fact, so long that it is impossible to quote it 
in extenso in the original German, and we must content ourselves 
with a somewhat condensed paraphrase, thrown for the sake of 
convenience into the same form as the descriptions of the species 
and varieties previously given. 

Up. s.: Ground colour much brighter red with strongly marked 
black nervures somewhat invaded in the central part of the f. w. by 
the ground colour; f. w.: border broad and of a deep black, all other 
markings wanting except a trace of the (?) inner subterminal on the 
inner margin, the outlines of the stigma and the basal lines, these 
giving the appearance of three spots of the ground colour surrounded 
with black. The up. s. of the female is lighter, with a light apical spot 
within the border, and the black nervures are nowhere overspread 
with the ground colour. (This light apical spot is here called by 
Riihl “ characteristic of parthenie,” but I have already, vol. xli. p. 223, 
quoted him as agreeing with me that it is sometimes present in 
other species, nor is it always to be found in parthente female.) 

Up. s. h. w.: border very broad and black including outer line ; 
basal suffusion reaching to inner line, this leaving only one row of 
spots of the ground colour ; basal spot small. 

Un. s. f. w.: a broad black streak along the inner margin; only 
one of the usual lines (? the elbowed line) is present, and consists 
of clear black spots and streaks. In one female the black streak 
along the inner margin is nearly obsolete, and nearly all the spots 
of the elbowed line are radiate; there is also part of a row of yellow 
lunules along the outer margin, edged internally with black. 

Un. s. h. w.: the usual banded arrangement nearly absent, the 
basal portion being red, the outer portion lemon-yellow, the two 
being separated by a bowed and indented black line; there are also 
four basal black spots; the inner edging line of the border is 
absent as in asterva, the outer being blacker and more sharply 
defined than usual; the black edging of the lunules of the terminal 
band is less arched but blacker than in the type ; the outer band repre- 
sented by a row of bright red spots partly round and partly 
triangular. In the female the inner edging line of the border shows 
in a rudimentary condition, the lunular part of the border being 
more distinct than in the male; the red spots of the outer band are 
reduced to centres surrounded by pale orange-red; the black basal 
spots very large and the dividing black line broader than in the 
male. 

It will be seen that this form of parthenie corresponds with 
the corythalia form of athalia, but with the un. s. f. w. of eos, 
and it might well have been doubted whether it were not in fact 
this species, but variants of this form of parthenie are figured by 
Oberthur in the ‘ Bulletin de la Société Entomologique Fran- 
caise’ for 1900, pp. 276-277, and if there is one author whose 
distinctions between athalia and parthenie are absolutely to be 
trusted it is Oberthur, as is shown by his paper in the ‘ Entomo- 


THE ATHALIA GROUP OF THE GENUS MELITMA. 151 


logist’s Record’, vol. xv. p. 818. The original specimens from 
which Rwuhl’s description was made came from Frankfort-on- 
Maine; it is also reported by Rondou from the Pyrenees, but 
he makes no mention of the underside. His description is as 
follows: ‘‘ Fond des supérieures d’un rouge vif, sans la rangée 
mediane de taches noires; bord externe largement noir ; inféri- 
eures d’un noir a peu prés uniforme sauf la bande marginale.’’* 
This it will be seen hardly corresponds to Ruhl’s description, 
except with regard to the up.s. h. w., and it may well be doubted 
whether the form is really the same. 

Var. beata is described by Caradja, ‘Iris’ vol. vi., p. 181 
(1894), as follows: ‘‘In den Thalern der Pyreniien bei Luchon, 
Sost, St. Béat, fliegt parthenie in einer sehr grossen, meist hellen 
Form, meine Sticke von dort messen im Durchschnitt 39 mm. 
(das grosste ? fast 41 mm.). Vielllicht verdient diese grosse lichte 
Lokalform mit einem Namen bezeichnet zu werden, als welche 
ich var. beata vorschlage.’’+ Specimens in the British Museum 
collection from Vernet seem to be Caradja’s beata, but there are 
others from Central France belonging to Sand’s collection 
and very erroneously marked ‘aurelia,’ which correspond 
completely with the above description. 

[The name polynome is attached to certain specimens of 
parthenie in Schaufuss’s collection which come from south- 
western Europe. This name I have traced to Schneider (‘ Sys- 
tematishe Beschreibung,’ p. 218), who refers it to Pillers und 
Mitterbachers ‘ Reisen’, pl. v. figs. 1, 2; this figure purports to be 
maturna which it certainly is not; so far as I can judge i should 
imagine it to have been taken from a specimen of phoebe with 
unicolorous ground, such as are found on the south side of the 
Alps, e.g. at Iselle or at Reazzino. It is certainly not parthenie.| 

Varia, having been generally regarded as a variety of 
parthenie, has not directly given rise to any named forms. It 
seems, however, probable that Aurivillius’ var. norvegica, 
‘ Nordens Fjarilar,’ p. 29 (1888), which is of course given by him 
as a variety of athalia, since he disregards all these specific 
differences, and which is referred by Staudinger to aurelia, 
should really be referred here; it is called varia by Lampa 
( ‘ Tidskrift,’ vi. p. 18, 1889), and it is erroneously suggested in 
the ‘ Entomologist’s Record,’ vol. xiii. p. 346, that on grounds of 
priority Lampa’s name should stand, but the priority is with 
Aurivillius’ name. If, however, Iam right in my opinion that 


* Ground colour of the f. w. of a bright red, the central row of black 
spots wanting, outer border broadly black; h. w. of an almost uniform black 
except the marginal band. 

+ In the valleys of the Pyrenees at Luchon, Sost, St. Béat, parthenve 
flies in a very iarge, mostly light form; my specimens from this locality 
measure 39 mm. across; the largest female almost 41 mm. Perhaps this 
large light local race ought to be distinguished by a name, for which I 
propose var. beata. 


152 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


varia is quite distinct from parthenie, the correct designation of 
this form would be “ varia, Bisch., var. norvegica, Auriv.” 

Britomartis having been already disposed of as certainly, and 
dictynnoides as probably, a distinct species, and veronice having 

» provisionally considered under athalia, we are left with the 

satisfactory var. rhetica to treat as a variety of aurelia. It is 
as described by Frey (‘ Lepidopteren der Schweiz.’ p. 30 (1880) ): 
* Kleiner, lebhafter rothbraun weniger trib, mit feineren 
schwarzen Zeichnungen, das 2 nicht selten mit schr lichten 
braunen Fleckreihen.”’* I speak of it as unsatisfactory, because 
the distinctions are so slight that it is difficult to separate it; 
specimens from the Rhone Valley, from Wiesbaden, and from 
Czernowitz, are scarcely distinguishable apart. The name 
should perhaps be reserved for the light Engadine specimens 
which were in the mind of the author, though these again can 
hardly be distinguished from the light females which occasionally 
appear among the Visp and Sion examples. The name is fre- 
quently, and wrongly, applied in Switzerland to smallish dark 
specimens. 

Dictynna, though a very variable species, has not given rise 
to many varietalnames. I have found but two: var. vernetensis, 
Oberthur, and ab. seminigra, Muschamp. After long searching 
I have been unable to find any reference to the former in 
Oberthiir’s published works, and can only trace it back to 
Rondou’s ‘ Lepidoptéres des Pyrénées,’ p. 24 (1903), where 
the name is ascribed to Oberthur and the following description 
given: ‘‘Une race constante et trés différente du type. LHlle 
est beaucoup plus claire que dans les Hautes-Pyrénées, ou elle 
ne differe point de celles de la France centrale. Le dessus des 
quatre ailes est a peine plus obesur que chez athalia; aux 
inférieures la couleur fauve domine.’”’t ‘This is a very distinct 
form, showing much more of the ground colour than one 
meets with elsewhere, but it is still quite obviously dictynna 
even on the upper side; when placed by the side of Reazzino 
britomartis it rather serves to emphasize the specific distinctions 
of the latter. 

Ab. seminigra, Muschamp, is shortly described as follows in 
the ‘Bulletin de la Société lépidoptérologique de Genéve,’ i. 
p. 70 (1905): ‘‘alis posterioribus nigris uno eodemque modo.” 
The original specimens were taken on the Campolungo Pass, but 
it is by no means confined to this locality. I have specimens 
from various parts of Switzerland. 

* Smaller, lighter red-brown, less dull, with narrower black markings, 
the female not rarely with very light brown rows of spots. 

+ A constant race and very different from the type. It is much lighter 
than in the Hautes-Pyrénées, where it is in no way different from those of 


Central France. The up. s. of both wings is scarcely darker than in athaha, 
on the h. w. the fulvous colour is predominant.

FIVE WEEKS IN THE VOSGES. 


By A. E. Gisss, F.L.S. 
(Concluded from p. 118.) 


Tue remainder of the holiday, which, on the whole, was 
in pleasing contrast meteorologically to the forest experiences, 
was spent at St. Maurice, every possible moment being devoted 
to entomology. During my absence one of my little girls had 
been working hard with her net, and had found out for her- 
self the best way to catch Huvanessa antiopa. Near a farm- 
house on the Ballon de Servance a cherry-tree grew beside the 
path, and at its foot was a runnel of water. Antiopa loves 
cherry juice, and quite a number of these fine insects could 
sometimes be seen feeding at the same time, descending occa- 
sionally to the water to drink, when they would fall an easy prey 
to the watchful hunter. Towards the end of our stay Papilio 
machaon began to get common. Soon after our arrival at St. 
Maurice, some larve were brought me which had been found 
feeding on the carrot foliage in the garden at the hotel, one of the 
pup being taken home to England by Mr. Barraud, who secured 
admirable photographs of it and the freshly emerged imago, 
and his pictures were hung at the annual exhibition of the Royal 
Photographie Society. Some beautiful specimens of Apatura iris 
were taken, chiefly in the mornings, sunning themselves on the 
branches of the hornbeams. Behind the cotton mill at the 
entrance to the Vallée de la Presle was a small thicket by the side 
of the stream, which was a favourite haunt of the regal butterfly, 
while on a clump of thistles close by Dryas paphia was almost 
sure to be found enthroned. Our last climb was to the summit 
of the Rouge Gazon, and was chiefly memorable for the abun- 
dance of fine dark females of Argynnis niobe var. eris, which 
were flying in the meadows above the forest.

FOUR NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS ERETMA- 
PODITES (Tueosatp) FROM ASHANTI. 


By W. M. Granam, M.B., 


Director Medical Research Institute, Lagos. 
(Concluded from p. 89.) 


3. Hretmapodites chrysogaster, nov. sp. 


d. The head is covered, as in No. 1, with dense parti-coloured 
flat scales in front, and in a triangular area behind with golden, 
narrow-curved, and black upright and golden upright forked scales. 
Six bristles project forward between the eyes, the anterior pair being 
golden in colour. 

Antenne : Plumose, the verticillate hairs pale brown. There are 
a few black scales on the basal segment, and the second segment is 
scaled also. The two apical segments are three times the length of 
the others. 

Palpi: Thin, acuminate, shorter than proboscis, without plum 
hairs, black. Proboscis: Long, thin, blue-black, curved apically. 
Clypeus: Dark brown, nude. 

Thorax: The mesonotum is covered with mingled black, narrow- 
curved and golden, narrow-curved scales. Three parallel longitudinal 
narrow black bands run backward over the central portion, the median 
black band being continued to the scutellum by a band of golden 
scales. The edge of the mesonotum is surrounded by an interrupted 
border of golden scales. 

Scutellum: The middle lobe is covered with a median band of 
white and two lateral bands of purple flat scales. There are four 
long bristles and some shorter ones on the edge. The lateral lobes . 
are covered with golden, narrow, and black, narrow-curved scales. 

Pleure: A dark golden colour, with patches of silvery white flat 
scales on meso- and meta-pleura, as in No. 1. The prothoracic lobes 
are covered with dense silvery white flat scales, and the apex of the 
prosternum with similar scales, as in No. 1. 

Halteres: Base pale, stalk and knob covered with bluish flat 
scales. Metanotum: Brown, with five hairs and a few golden, 
narrow-curved scales at the apex. 

Abdomen: The venter is pale golden, with apical black bands on 
‘the fifth, sixth, and seventh segments. The dorsum and sides are 
velvety black, with triangular lateral white spots, the apex of the 
triangle being towards the dorsum and the base resting on the edge 
of the golden venter. There is an apical, dorsal, silvery band on the 
seventh segment. 

Legs: A blue-black, with apical white bands on the femora of the 
third pair. The last two segments of the hind tarsi are feathered 
with elongated black scales. 

Ungues: First pair equal, one simple, one uniserrate; second 
pair same as first pair; third pair equal, small, simple. The last 
segment of the tarsus of the first and second pairs has a stout tooth

or thorn on the ventral surface inserted immediately behind the 
joint. There is no such tooth on the tarsus of the third pair. 

Wings: Very darkly scaled with Trichoprosopon-like scales, 
bluish and markedly ribbed. First submarginal cell one-fourth of its 
length longer than the second posterior cell. The stem of the first 
submarginal is about two-thirds the length of the cell. The super- 
numerary and mid cross-veins are close together, the posterior about 
its own length towards the base of the wing. The sixth vein turns 
at right angles to the costa just before its termination. 

Genitalia: The claspers are long, curved, and without terminal 
articulate spine, covered, the basal half with scales, the distal half 
with seven long hairs. The harpes are long, curved, and expanded 
into a flattened blade tapering to a rounded point. 

Length: 5 mm. 

?. Head as in male. Antenne: Much less plumose; other- 
wise similar to those of the male. Palpi: Short, black-scaled, 
acuminate. 

Proboscis, clypeus, thorax, scutellum, pleura, prothoracic lobes, 
halteres, metanotum: As in male. 

Abdomen: As in male, and with the dorsal silvery band on the 
seventh segment complete. ; 

Legs: As in the male, but the last two segments of the hind tarsi 
are of normal form, 7. e. unfeathered. 

Ungues: First pair equal, uniserrate; second pair equal, uni- 
serrate ; third pair equal, simple. 

Wings: Colour and scales as in male. First submarginal cell 
one-fifth of its length longer than the second posterior cell. The stem 
of the first submarginal is usually one-third the length of the cell. 
The supernumerary and mid cross-veins are close together, the pos- 
terior about its own length towards the base of the wing. The sixth 
vein is as in the male. 

Length: 6 mm. 


Habitat. Obuasi, Kumasi, Dompoasi; taken in bush August 
to November. Also reared from larve taken in a small collec- 
tion of water in the hollow of a tree near Dompoasi, Aug. 14th. 


4. Hretmapodites melanopous, nov. sp. 


g. Head, antenne, palpi, proboscis, clypeus: As in No. 3. 

Thorax: As in No. 3, but the ground colour is somewhat darker 
brown, and black scales predominate. 

Scutellum, pleure, halteres, metanotum: As in No. 3. 

Abdomen: Is a velvety black, with basal white ventral banding, 
the bands showing laterally, and gradually becoming more apical till 
the apex is white ventrally on the sixth segment. There is a yellow 
spot on the sixth and seventh segments of the venter. The white 
banding becomes dorsal on the seventh segment, but the lateral spots 
do not meet in the middle line. 

Legs: As in No. 3, but the hind tarsi are unfeathered. 

Ungues: First pair unequal, simple; second pair unequal, simple ; 
third pair equal, simple. The terminal segment of the tarsus of the 
first pair has two strong teeth inserted immediately behind the joint. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 159 


The terminal segment of the second pair has two short thick teeth, 
differing in shape and insertion from those of the first pair. There 
are no teeth on the tarsi of the third pair. 

Wings: As in No. 3, but first submarginal cell is about one-third 
of its length longer than the second posterior, and the stem of the 
first submarginal cell is about one-half the length of the cell. The 
supernumerary and mid cross-veins are close together, the posterior 
cross-vein about its own length towards the base of the wing. 

Genitalia: The claspers are long and curved and without terminal 
articulate spine, and generally as in No. 3. 

Length: 5 mm. 

@. Head as in male. Antenne; Less plumose, and as in 
female, No. 3. Palpi: Short, black, acuminate. 

Abdomen: As in male almost exactly, the dorsal silvery band on 
the seventh segment being incomplete in the middle line, as in male, 

Legs: As in male.

cell. Cross-veins as in the male; sixth vein as in the male. 

Length: 6 mm. 


Habitat. Obuasi in June, July, August, October, and Novem- 
ber, in bush, between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


NoNAGRIA NEURICA IN THE Mappison Conuection. —I see the 
‘Entomologist’ on p. 124 records that the late Mr. Maddison’s 
melanie Nonagria newrica came from Horning. This was an error 
in the label, as these N. newrica came from myself, and were not 
Norfolk specimens. So far as I know, melanic examples of N. newrica 
have not been taken at Horning, where Messrs. Bowles, Hdelsten, 
and myself have taken very many specimens of the typical form.— 
A. Rozsinson; 5, King’s Bench Walk, Temple, E.C., May 4th, 1909. 


SATURNIA PAVONIA, ab.—Yesterday I captured a rather remarkable 
variety of Saturnia pavonia, which I should describe as a ‘“blind”’ 
variety, as it has the spots where the eyes usually are blank. This 
is probably the rare variety mentioned in ‘ Moths of the British Isles.’ 
The spots on all four wings are identical. The centres are filled in with 
pale fuscous colour, with no shading whatever. I took the specimen 
on the Quantock Hills near here. It is a fine male. By the way, 
the species seems well-established here, as I saw over two hundred 
in just over an hour and a half.—W. A. Boaur; The Bank House, 
Watchet, Somerset, May 3rd, 1909. 


GyNnaNDROUsS AmMoRPHA popuLI.—Although I believe gynandrous 
specimens of A. popult are, comparatively speaking, common, it may 
be of interest to record that I have just bred a very fine one, left side 


160 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


male, right female. The right-hand wings are longer and narrower 
than those on the left, giving the insect a slightly lop-sided look; 
their colour, too, is very much duller and browner than those on the 
male side. The antennz correspond, that on the left being much 
stouter and longer and much more strongly pectinated than that on 
the right; also the legs, those on the male side being much stouter 
and more hairy than the corresponding female ones. There is also 
a distinct ridge or dividing line down the exact centre of the body, 
the shade of colouring on either side matching the wings, and the 
male anal tuft is confined to the left side; so that it seems to be a 
fairly evenly divided insect. I bred it from a larva found here last 
year.—P. A. Carprw (Capt.); St. Aldwyns, Park Avenue, Dover, 
May 10th, 1909. 


CATOCALA FRAXINI IN SussEx.—A fine female of this species was 
taken at rest on the trunk of an old poplar near the railway-station 
at Horsham, on Sept. 3rd, 1908, by Mr. A. James, of Tooting Groove. 
The moth was placed in a muslin cage, fed with syrup on a sponge, 
and obligingly laid about one hundred and twenty eggs, after knock- 
ing itself about somewhat in a vain attempt to escape, having in 
view, I suppose, that something more succulent than dry muslin to 
eat would be necessary for its future progeny. The ova, some of 
which I have in my possession, commenced to hatch on 4th inst., 
and some few have not yet hatched (14th inst.). A few of the larvee 
are now in the second instar, but I regret that rather a large percen- 
tage of the young larvee died in moulting. I had an opportunity of 
inspecting the parent moth; it was also exhibited, I understand, at 
the South London Entomological Society in April. I am informed 
that there have been several captures of this exceedingly rare species 
in Surrey and Sussex during the past few years.—J. J. JAcoss 
(Lieut. R.E.) ; Gillingham, Kent, May 14th, 1909. 


A Nature Stupy EXxuisirtion, organised by the Nature Study 
Society, will be held at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Regent’s Park, 
N.W., on Friday and Saturday, June 4th and 5th. Open each day 
from 10 am. to sundown. It will include Aquaria, Vivaria, and other 
means of observing animals, with photographic and microscopic 
illustrations. Tickets and all particulars may be obtained of Miss 
WINIFRED DE LisuEe, Hon. Sec. of the Committee, 58, Tyrwhitt 
Road, Brockley, S.E. 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


Corias EDUSA IN May.—I saw a specimen of Colias edusa to-day. 
—Frank W. FisHer; Cranborn, Salisbury, May 19th, 1909. 


Notes FROM THE SoutH Mipuanps.—My brother took a male 
specimen of Cerwra bifida on a poplar-trunk at Peterborough yester- 
day (April 26th). On the same day a Notodonta dromedarius taken in 
the district emerged in my breeding-cage. The season has been very 
early this year. Sallow was almost over here before it came out in 
the New Forest or in Sussex, and I have Feb. 5th as a date for 
Hyberna leucophearia and Lycia (Biston) hirtaria. Teniocampa

miniosa was extremely abundant in the Northants woods this year, 
and I took some very unusual varieties of J. munda. Apocheima 
hispidaria taken near Bedford Purlieux on March 18th seems a new 
locality. I believe it is not previously recorded in the district.— 
C. Mettows; Brasenose College, Oxford. 


ACHERONTIA ATROPOS IN May.—On the evening of the 10th inst. 
a working-man brought me one of these moths, which had just 
settled on his trousers below the knee, and had then run up his leg 
as he was walking in the street. When he caught it in his hand he 
said ‘it squeaked just like a mouse,” and he was rather afraid of it. 
However, he took it home and placed it under a tumbler, and then 
brought it to me. It was a male, and rather a fine dark one, and 
would have been quite perfect but for a piece chipped out of one of 
its hind wings, doubtless by its captor. I kept it in a breeding-cage 
all night, and released it the next evening as soon as it began to move 
about, and it looked like a small bird as it flew off in the gloom. 
The species is not often seen at this time of the year in Britain.-— 
GervasE F. MatHew; Dovercourt, May 12th, 1909. 


SOCIETIES. 


Entomouoaican Society or Lonpon.— Wednesday, March 17th, 
1909.— Dr. F. A. Dixey, M.A., M.D., President, in the chair.—Capt. 
Ki. Bagnell-Purefoy, The Cottage, East Farleigh, Maidstone; Mr. 
Stanley A. Blenkarn, 44, Romola Road, Tulse Hill, $8.E.; Mr. Leonard 
Box, the Floral Nurseries, Hailsham, Sussex, and 28, St. James’s 
Street, Bedford Row, W.C.; Mr. Henry Britten, Prospect House, 
Salkeld Dykes, Penrith; the Rev. C. R. N. Burrows, of Mucking 
Vicarage, Stanford-le-Hope; and Mr. W. A. Rollason, ‘‘ Lamorna,” 
Truro, were elected Fellows of the Society.— M. A. Janet, member 
of the Entomological Society of France, and M. Severin, member 
of the Entomological Society of Belgium, were present as visitors. 
—Mr. H. Rowland-Brown exhibited two extreme forms of Chryso- 
phanus phieas from Norwegian Finmarken and the Mediterranean 
region, drawing attention to the apparent identity of the form from 
Arctic Europe—hypophl@as—with the species described as amert- 
canus from North America. He also showed series of Plebevus argyro- 
gnomon, Brgstr. taken by him at Alten and Abisko, Swedish Lap- 
Jand; P. argus var. corsica from Corsica; and P. argus, approaching 
var. bella, H. 8., from Digne, Basses-Alpes.— Mr. H. Hamilton 
Druce also brought for exhibition examples of Plebewus argus, L., 
taken by him in various localities in Russia.—Mr. G. Meade-Waldo 
exhibited a gynandromorphous example of Huchloé cardamines, bred 
from a larva found at Hever, Kent.—Mr. H. M. Edelsten brought for 
exhibition stereoscopic photographs of the anal segments of Cwnobia 
rufa, female, showing the spines which are driven into the dead stems 
of Juncus lamprocarpus during oviposition. — Mr. W. Schmassman 
showed, on behalf of Mr. H. Welte, a curiously marked female of 
Chrysophanus hippothoé from Goeschenen, Switzerland. The black 
spots, forming the marginal row on the under side of the two

fore wings and one of the hind wings, were elongated. The other 
hind wing and the wings on the upper side were normal. Mr. 
C. O. Waterhouse sent for exhibition living males and immature 
females of the mammoth scale-insect which infests the M’sasa tree in 
Rhodesia: also a dead example of the fully-grown female scale. 
They are what are known in collections under the generic name 
Monophlebus. The female has been named Lophococcus maximus 
by Mr. Lounsbury.—Mr. EH. A. Butler exhibited one species of Coleo- 
ptera, and five of Hemiptera, recently added to the British Fauna; also 
the unique example of Mymecocoris gracilis, Sahlb., taken by him at 
Fleet, Hants, in August, 1903.—Mr. H. J. Arrow exhibited examples 
of a Cetoniid beetle, Dicronorrhina (subg. Neptunides) manowensts 
Moser, to show injuries of a remarkable character. In all the marks 
were perfectly symmetrical and occupied exactly the same position. 
—Dr. K. Jordan exhibited the polymorphic Papilio lysithous and P. 
hectorides from Brazil, and the models which they imitate. The exhibit 
illustrated a phenomenon observed in various groups of butterflies : 
that a mimetic species is broken up into a number of very different- 
looking individual varieties, which are all specifically the same, while 
the imitated models are specifically distinct from one another. He 
also exhibited both sexes of the peculiar Peruvian butterfly, Styx 
infernalis, described by Staudinger as a Pierid, but certainly an 
Erycinid in the structure of the antenna, thorax, legs, neuration, and 
the egg. Dr. Jordan also showed, on behalf of the Hon. N. Charles 
Rothschild, an Acrotylus which Mr. Rothschild had observed in some 
numbers in the desert on the Upper Nile. The colour of these small 
locusts so closely agrees with that of the sand and the pebbles (also 
exhibited) that, when settled, the insects disappear entirely from 
view.—Mr. J. W. Tutt opened a discussion on the affinities of the 
two Palzarctic species, Plebevus argus, L. (egon, Schiff.; argyrotoxus, 
Brgstr.) and P. argyrognomon, Brgstr. (argus auctorum). After 
giving an account of the confusion in nomenclature, he proceeded to 
explain the structural and superficial differences of the respective 
imagines. It was also remarkable to note that both showed a parallel 
range of varieties in the mountain, plain, and southern forms. Dr. 
T. A. Chapman then gave a demonstration with the lantern, illus- 
trated by many slides, of the structural differences of the two species 
in the larval and imaginal stages, and criticized the opinion expressed 
by Staudinger that argus and argyrognomon have not yet entirely 
developed into separate species. The microscopic preparations 
showed that the “claw” or spine over the front tibize in argus was 
not even represented in rudimentary form in argyrognomon. 
Wednesday, April Tth.—Dr. F. A. Dixey, M.A., M.D., President, 
in the chair.—Mr. R. Shelford exhibited a number of examples of 
mimetic Blattide, the models being Coleoptera, principally Cocci- 
nellide, and Chrysomelide.—Mr. H. M. Edelsten showed some ova 
of Tapinostola fulva (in sitw) laid within the curled leaf of Carex 
paludosa; also a photograph of the anal segments of the female, 
showing the ear-like appendages, from the ventral side. These, when 
not in use, are carried flat, but when the female is going to lay, they 
are folded together and thrust between the curled edges of a leaf to 
force it avart; the fold makes a hollow in which the ova are

deposited ; and the leaf closes over the ova when the appendages are 
withdrawn. The discussion on the two similar species, Plebius argus 
and P. argyrognomon was resumed and concluded.—Mr. H. St. J. 
Donisthorpe read a paper “On the Origin and Ancestral Form of 
Myrmecophilous Coleoptera.”—Mr. W. L. Distant communicated a 
paper on “ Rhynchota Malayana.”—Mr. J. H. Collin communicated a 
paper by Mr. Wesché “On the Antenne of Diptera, and the Present 
Classification of the Nemocera, with two subsidiary sections bearing 
on the latter subject.” —Mr. G. A. K. Marshall then read a paper en- 
titled “On Reciprocal Mimiery. A Rejoinder to Dr. F. A. Dixey.” 
Dr. Dixey had taken the view that within the limits of a Miillerian 
association every species exercises a mimetic influence upon every 
other, the amount of the influence depending upon its dominance, 
which is determined by its numbers, distastefulness, and general 
notoriety. Thus, as between any two species, the mimetic approach 
would be mutual and result in an interchange of characters. This 
interchange would be proportionate to the relative dominance of the 
two species; where this is unequal, the weaker species would take 
on, to a considerable extent, the superficial appearance of the 
stronger, while the latter would adopt only some small characters 
from its mimic; but where the dominance is equal, the interchange 
would be equal, so that this would constitute the optimum condition 
for the production of reciprocal mimicry. On the other hand, Mr. 
Marshall contended that this gravitational conception of mimicry was 
really based on a false analogy and was at variance with the real 
principle of Miller’s theory. While admitting the theoretical possi- 
bility of mimetic interchange, he urged that a logical application of 
Miiller’s argument would lead to the view that mimetic approach 
would be one-sided only, that is, from a weaker species towards a 
stronger and even in an opposite direction; further, that when the 
relative dominance of the two species was equal, the mere operation 
of Miiller’s factor would produce no mimetic effect until some other 
factor had first produced a condition of inequality. On this view 
mimetic interchange would never be mutual and simultaneous, but 
would only result from a complete reversal of the relative dominance 
of the two species during the production of the mimetic resemblance. 
For this process he had suggested the name of “ Alternate Mimicry.” 
Mr. Marshall said also that he was compelled to reject entirely Dr. 
Dixey’s new hypothesis as to the ‘function of the double aposeme,”’ 
because it completely left out of consideration the differences and re- 
semblances between the various forms regarded from the standpoint of 
general facies ; he contended that resemblance in general effect was of 
the first importance in considering mimetic relationship, and that this 
new hypothesis was liable to be extremely misleading on account of 
the exaggerated significance which it attached to the merely partial 
resemblance which might be said to exist between two species 
possessing a single conspicuous feature in common but differing 
markedly in other respects. Moreover, not only was the theoretical 
position of Reciprocal Mimicry very unsatisfactory and unconvincing, 
but, further, the cases which had been cited as proving its actual 
occurrence in nature appeared open to serious criticism. For while 
in some cases the facts did not appear to justify the assertion that an 


164 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


interchange had taken place, in the others such an interpretation 
involved many difficulties which disappeared when the mimetic phe- 
nomena were interpreted as being due to the simple mimicry of one 
form by another. Dr. Dixey stated that he did not consider the 
Presidential chair to be a proper place in which to reply to Mr. 
Marshall’s criticism, and that he would therefore deal with the points 
at issue on some future occasion. Mr. C. J. Gahan very strongly 
supported the opinions advocated by Mr. Marshall, and expressed the 
view that while Dr. Dixey professed to support Millerian mimicry 
yet his defence of Reciprocal Mimicry really constituted a severe 
attack upon that theory. Mr.§8. A. Neave said that as a result of his 
field experience in Africa he was unable to accept the theory as to 
the function of ‘double aposemes,” but he did not mean thereby to 
imply that he rejected every case of Reciprocal Mimicry. He sug- 
gested that Alternate Mimicry might not be so uncommon a pheno- 
menon as Mr. Marshall appeared to think. Mr. Tutt, Mr. W. E. 
Sharp, and Professor Hudson Beare also made some brief comments 
on the subject—H. Rownanp-Browy, M.A., Hon. Sec. 


THe Sourn Lonpon EntromonoaicaL AND Naturau History 
Society.—March 11th, 1909.—My. A. Sich, F.E.S., President, in the 
chair.— Mr. West (of Greenwich) exhibited another section of the 
Society's reference collection which he had remounted and arranged. 
—Mr, South, a short series of Aczdalva degeneraria received from Mr. 
J. Walker, of Torquay, and pointed out that they were lighter in colour 
than the Portland’ form—Mr. Newman, specimens of Cleora angu- 
laria (viduaria), a pair of Phibalapteryx polygrammata ab. olivacea, 
and ab. obsoleta of Camptogramma fluviata, and four melanic examples 
of Notodonta ziczac_—Mr. Kaye, a drawer of aberrations and geo- 
graphical races of Cosmotriche potatoria. — Messrs. Tonge, Harrison, 
Main, Joy, Moore, Grosvenor, Pickett, Turner, Dr. Chapman, Dr. 
Hodgson, and Rey. G. Wheeler, a large number of species, races, and 
forms of the “blue” butterflies to illustrate Mr. Tutt’s remarks on the 
family. Mr. Tonge also exhibited photographic life-histories of the 
“blue” butterflies. Mr. Tutt then gave a ‘Gossip on the Blue 
Butterflies,” summarising all that was known of their life-histories 
and relationships, pointing out modern ideas of the grouping, and 
emphasizing the necessity of the genera being based upon the sum 
total of our knowledge of the species and their habits in all stages. 

March 25th.— The President in the chair.— Mr. A. E. Gibbs, 
E.E.S., of St. Albans, Mr. A. W. Buckstone, of Chiswick, and Mr. 
J. H. Rohde, of Reigate, were elected members. — Mr. G. B. Brown 
exhibited specimens of Hubolia bipunctarva from Branscombe and 
Dawlish, and pointed out their reddish suffusion compared with speci- 
mens exhibited from Horsley. He also showed specimens of Agriades 
corydon having slight reddish suffusion.—Mr. Hy. J. Turner, a box of 
butterflies recently obtained from Columbia. — Mr. Tonge, an under 
side of Acronycta pst, in which the central black spot was produced 
towards the base as a line——Mr. Bowman, a very pale female of 
Nyssia hispidaria from Chingford. — Mr. Coote, ova of the same 
species, and a female specimen of Anisopteryx ecularia. — Mr. Kaye, 
specimens of Chrysophanus dispar, and a short series of Xylina furct-

fera (conformis)—The remainder of the meeting was devoted to an 
exhibition of lantern slides by Messrs. Tonge, Dennis, West (Ashtead), 
Main, Step, and Lucas. 

April 8th.—The President in the chair—Mr. Hemmings and Mrs. 
Hemmings, of Horley, were elected members.—Mr. Newman, a living 
female of Asteroscopus nubeculosa, bred that morning after being four 
years in the pupal stage—Mr. Main, ova-cases of a leaf insect from 
Ceylon, each containing one ovum. The species was parthogenetic, 
males being rarely produced.— Mr. Turner, a series of the delicate 
Pyrale Glyphodes sinuata from the Ja River, Cameroons.—Mr. Adkin 
read a short paper entitled ‘‘ Notes on a Series of Boarmia repandata, 
with some Remarks upon the Variation and Distribution of the 
Species in Britain,” and exhibited long series of the species in illus- 
tration of the paper. — Mr. Turner read the Report of the Society’s 
Visit to the Zoological Museum, Tring, on March 27th. About thirty 
members and friends were present. 

April 22nd. — The President in the chair. — Mr. Tonge exhibited 
remains of an unusually dark Catocala fraxini, taken at Horsham in 
1908, with some of the ova laid by it.— Mr. West (Ashtead), living 
larva of a stick-insect, feeding on privet-leaves. — Mr. Joy, a pupa of 
Cyclopides palemon. The larva hybernated from mid-October in a 
tent among grass, emerged in the spring, wandered but did not feed, 
and had just pupated. He referred to a brood of Brenthis euphrosyne, 
of which, on March 15th, forty-five out of about eighty were alive. 
The subsequent severe weather killed off all but four, of which two 
had already turned to pupa. — Mr. Rayward, ova i sztw, found wild, 
of Polygonia c-album. They were always near the apex of the leaf on 
the upper side.—Mr. Tonge read a paper, ‘The Resting Positions of 
Butterflies and Moths,” illustrating his remarks with a large number 
of admirable lantern-slides, many of them from photographs taken on 
the occasions of the various field meetings of the Society.— Hy. J. 
Turner, Hon. Rep. Sec. 


Ciry or Lonpon Enromonoaican Socrety.—Lebruary 16th, 1909. 
—KExhibits were practically confined to Pseudoterpna cytisaria, which 
was the subject of the paper appointed to be read on this occasion 
by Rev. C. R. N. Burrows. 

March 2nd, 1909.—A special exhibit of Polyommatus phleas was 
the feature of the evening. Dr. T. A. Chapman exhibited various 
Kuropean and extra-European series, including examples from Sicily 
(? spring brood) lighter in colour and with black markings less 
pronounced than in normal English specimens; from Spain (? summer 
brood), mostly var. elews or abs. approaching thereto ; from Teneriffe 
with black markings accentuated as regards both size and depth of 
colour, but with ground colour clear and bright; from Japan, some 
with ground colour and others with same suffused with black; and 
from India, all with ground colour completely obscured with smoky 
suffusion. English specimens, with copper marginal band on hind 
wings broken up into alternate dashes of copper and black, were 
exhibited by Messrs. 8. J. Bell and L. W. Newman, while Mr. J. E. 
Shaw showed an ab. with entirely black hind wings from Darenth, 
and var. elews from Bexley. — Mr. H. M. Edelsten, Camptogramma

fluviata bred from South Devon female, the larve having all pupated 
(save two) on one day, and the imagines having all (save two) 
emerged during one day. — Mr. J. Riches, larve of this species fed 
on dandelion in a hot-house; also a specimen of Arctia caia with 
usual black markings on hind wings restricted to three marginal 
blotches. — Mr. A. J. Wellsdon, Phigalia pedaria, bred from wild 
Yorks melanie female ; about ten per cent. of the brood were melanie, 
a few light-coloured, and the rest intermediate forms.—S. J. Brun, 
Hon. Sec. 


LANCASHIRE AND CHESHIRE EnTomonocicAL Socrety.—Meeting 
held at the Royal Institution, Colquitt Street, Liverpool, March 15th, . 
1909.—Mr. C. E. Stott, Vice-President, in the chair.— A paper was 
read by Mr. H. R. Sweeting entitled ‘The Value of Variation to a 
Species.” — Mr. W. Mansbridge exhibited specimens of Amphidasys 
betularia, and its variety dowbledayaria, which had been bleached by 
exposure to chlorine; also A. stratarva, which had been kept alive in 
an atmosphere containing a considerable amount of chlorine for 
forty-eight hours, also a specimen which had been killed in a strong 
atmosphere of chlorine. In the former experiment, A. strataria, 
compared with a check specimen, showed no bleaching, but in the 
latter the insect died in one minute, and the dark markings were at 
once bleached to light brown.—Mr. C. EH. Stott communicated notes 
on recent additions to the local list of Coleoptera, and exhibited, on 
behalf of Dr. Knight, of St. Annes, a tube containing a number of 
Glossiniw (tsetse flies).— Mr. W. A. Tyerman exhibited Agrotis 
exclamationis var. nigra and a specimen of Aplecta occulta from 
Ainsdale.—H. R. SwEETING and Wma. ManssripGe, Hon. Secs.

RECENT LITERATURE. 


A Guide to the Natural History of the Isle of Wight. Edited by 
Frank Morey, F.L.S.; with contributions (on Insecta) by 
Marcorum Burr, B.A; F.E.S., F-L.S., FUZS.,: F.G.8.2 W: J; 
Lucas, B.A., F.E.S.; CuaupE Mortey, F.E.S., F.Z.S.; HE. A. 
Newsery; Horace §8t.J. K. DonitstHorps, F.Z.S., F.E.S., &amp;ce.;

Pp. xx, 560; with Map. Isle of Wight: The County” Press, 
Newport. London: William Wesley &amp; Son. 1909. 


Tuts bulky volume deals with the whole of the natural history of 
the island, and, considering that it is but some three years since the 
project was initiated by the editor, we consider that the result goes 
far to show him worthy of the trust suggested by its production. 
Fuller working of the central inland districts, and especially of the 
woods and open ground, would add considerably to the various 
faunistic lists, since the heel of the invader from dingier climes is 
shown all along the coast-line, more particularly at the “back” of 
the island. But the resident naturalists are few, though all such 
appear to have most liberally assisted in the satisfactory issue, which 
is evidenced by the totals :—Orthoptera, 23 species; Neuroptera, 
29 species; Hymenoptera, 472 species; Coleoptera, 1434 species ; 
Lepidoptera, 972 species; Diptera, 281 species; and Hemiptera, 
324 species. All these, however, are obviously open to augmentation, 
and we trust those who sojourn or have sojourned in Vectis will 
comply with the editor’s request, suffixed to his excellent Preface, 
for further information upon their especial groups.

Catalogue of the Lepidoptera Phalene in the British Museum. 
Vol. vii. By Sir Grorcre F. Hampson, Bart. Pp. i-xv, 1-709; 
with Atlas of fifteen coloured plates. London: Printed by 
Order of the Trustees. 1908. 


THe bulky volume under notice, which is the fourth dealing with 
the classification of the Noctuide, treats of the Acronyctine. The 
author states that, as there are about three thousand species belonging 
to over three hundred genera referable to this subfamily, their con- 
sideration will occupy two other volumes, in addition to the present 
one in which over eight hundred species and rather less than one 
hundred genera are entered and described. Thirty-seven of the 
genera have each but one species, and sixteen others have thirty-six 
species between them; three genera (Z’rachea, Perigea, EHriopus), on 
the other hand, embrace a total of two hundred and seventy species. 

In Trachea, Ochsenheimer, = Achatia, Hiibner, Tent. (t. atriplicis, 
L.), are merged Phosphila, Hiibn. (t. turbulenta, Hiibn.), Hama, 
Steph. (t. anceps, Schiff.), Berrhea, Walk. (t. awrigera, Walk.), Chan- 
data, Moore (t. partita, Moore), and Epa, Beth.-Baker (t. pratt, 
Beth.-Baker). 

According to our author, nigricans, Vieweg, is an earlier name for 
abjecta, Hiibner, but is not eligible in this connection ; he, however,

rescues oblonga, Haworth (1809), from the obscure position assigned 
it by Stephens and others, as a form of gemina, Hitbner, and adopts 
it as a prior name for the species known as alyecta, Hiibn. 

Although Stephens was certainly in error in quoting ferruginea, 
Esper, as the type of his genus Rusina, there is little doubt that his 
specific description and generic characters were obtained from wmbra- 
tica, Goeze, = tenebrosa, Hiibn. It is to be regretted, therefore, that 
Rusina has been sunk in Amathes, Hiibn. (Cat. Phal. vi. 470), and in 
the present volume Stygiostola set up for wnbratica, Goeze. 

Under Oliga, Hiibner (t. strigzlis, Clerck), we have Miana, 
Stephens (t. literosa, Haworth), and Photedes, Lederer (t. captiuncula). 
Other British species included in this genus, besides those usually » 
assigned to Miana, are ophiogramma, Esp., scolopacina, Hsp., and 
havorthi (haworthiw, Curtis). 

Crymodes, Guenée (t. cervina, Germar, = matllardi, Geyer, = exulis, 
Lef.), is merged in Hremobia, Stephens (t. ochroleuca, Schiff.). 

Fissipuncta, Haworth, =ypsilon, Schiff., and zollicofert (zollakofert, 
Freyer), are both referred to Sidemia, Staudinger (t. speciosa, Bremer). 
Testacea, Schiff., nickerlii, Freyer, and dumeriliz, Duponchel, which, 
with two other species, Staudinger places under Apamea, O.-Treit., 
are here retained in Luperina, Boisduval (t. dwmeriit). 

Lithorylea, Schiff., is the type of Xylophasia, Stephens (1829), 
also of Septis, Hibn. (Verz., p. 243), and of Xylena, Hitbn. (Tent.), 
but as this species is congeneric with hepatica, Linn., which is the 
type of Parastichtis, Hiibn. (Verz., p. 212), the latter genus is adopted 
for the species just mentioned and their allies. 

On the fifteen coloured plates are four hundred and eighty figures. 
In addition to a systematic index at the beginning of the volume, 
there is a very full alphabetical index (sixteen pages) at the end. 


OBITUARY. 


Epwin C. H. Davies belonged to that class of working-man 
naturalist which is so fast dying out with the progress made by so- 
called Nature Study in our modern educational system. He was born 
at Porkellis, near Helston, in Cornwall, and had lived for thirty-two 
years at St. Issey, where he filled the post of rural postman, doing a 
twelve-mile round daily for the last sixteen years. As a volunteer he 
became associated with Dr. Griffin, of Padstow, and it is from him 
and Rey. J. A. Crawshay, his acting vicar for some months, that he 
appears to have got his taste for natural history. Davies contributed 
lists of the Ichneumonide and Aculeate Hymenoptera to the Victoria 
History of Cornwall, was interested in Coleoptera, &amp;c., and added 
botanical records to the ‘ Flora of Cornwall,’ by F. H. Davey, F.L.5., 
which will shortly be published. He died of consumption on 
Jan. 12th last, aged thirty-seven years, leaving an aged mother and 
young married sister. His Hymenopterous collection has passed to 
Mr. W. A. Rollason, of Truro, who supplies these details.

FURTHER VARIATION IN NYSSIA LAPPONARIA. 
By HE. A. Cockayne, M.A., F.E.S., F.L.S. 
(PuatE VY.) 


Amonast a very large number of males of Nyssia lapponaria 
which I have examined since I wrote my note in the ‘ Entomolo- 
gist,’ vol. xxxvil. p. 249, the following forms seem worthy of 
record :— 

In 1906 Mr. F. W. J. Jackson bred a very remarkable aberra- 
tion from eggs which I obtained in the Rannoch district. In the 
fore wing of this (fig. 1), a very small specimen, the third line is 
moved inwards so far from the termen that it passes through 
and obscures the discal spot. The second line is also moved 
inwards and joins the third about halfway across the wing. The 
first line is further than usual from the base of the wing, and 
runs almost parallel to the second, actually touching it at a point 
a short distance from the costa. Thus all three lines are parti- 
ally fused, and the large space which usually exists between the 
first and second line is almost obliterated. Similar aberrations 
are well known in many other Geometride. 

Fig. 2 shows a melanie specimen in which the second line, 
though indistinct, does touch the first, but the third line is in 
the normal situation. 

These two photographs were taken with the same conditions 
of light and background. 

In 1907 I took a male with all the orange replaced by yellow. 
Specimens with the costa pale yellow and the abdominal stripe 
speckling orange are not very uncommon. In this, as far as I 
know a unique male, the costa is almost white, and the thoracic 
and abdominal stripe pale yellow. I have also one female with 
yellow instead of orange markings. For this yellow form lutea 
seems to be a suitable name. 

This year I have received a specimen (fig. 3) with the black 
lines more obsolete than in any other I have seen. The discal 
spot is very distinct, and the costal stripe unusually deep orange. 


ENTOM.—JULY, 1909. P 


170 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


In the last specimen (fig. 4) there is an almost complete 
fusion of the second and third lines, and the hind wings are very 
distinctly marked. 

Figs. 3 and 4 are from photographs taken in bright daylight, 
but not, as figs. 1 and 2, in actual sunlight, and therefore appear 
less brilliant. All are somewhat enlarged. 


FOSSIL INSECTS FROM COLORADO. 
By T. D. A. CocKxERretu. 


CypNipm® (HEmrprEra). 
Cydnopsis handlirscht, sp. nov. 

Length, 6mm.; breadth of thorax, 34; breadth of scutellum at 
base just over 2 mm., its length fully 24; width of head about 
14mm. MHead and thorax densely and rather coarsely granulate ; 
head broad, subtruneate in front, with the median lobe narrow; sides 
apparently excavated, and angular near the middle, but this is due 


Cydnopsis handlirschi. 


merely to the faintness of the large eyes, which in reality fill the 
excavation ; sides of thorax broadly rounded ; scutellum triangular, 
longer than broad, the lateral margins straight, the apex obtuse ; 
corium moderately dense, membrane without visible veins; tibial 
armature not visible ; antennz not preserved. 

In Scudder’s table of American Fossil Cydnide (‘ Tertiary 
Insects of North America,’ p. 437) this runs to Cyrtomenus. It 
shows much resemblance to Cyrtomenus concinnus, Scudd., from 
the Green River shales of Wyoming, but it differs greatly in the 
shape of the scutellum (very broad, and oblong rather than tri- 
angular in C. concinnus), the relatively smaller head, and the 
more convex profile of the lateral lobes of the thorax. In form 
and structure C. handlirschi is very close to Pangeus bilineatus, 
Say, which lives to-day in Colorado (it occurs at Boulder, and 
Judge Henderson has obtained it at Fossil Creek), but the Pangeus 
is a smooth shining insect instead of being dull and roughened. 
In every respect our fossil appears to accord well with Cydnopsis, 
Heer, described from the European Miocene. In several of 
Heer’s species of Cydnopsis the sides of the scutellum are dis- 


FOSSIL INSECTS FROM* COLORADO. Lge 


tinctly concave in outline, but in one or two they are virtually 
straight, as in ours. The sculpture of the corium in our insect 
is practically as in C. tertiaria, Heer, but the sides of the thorax 
in front are more rounded than in that species. In the shape of 
the head and thorax our insect closely resembles Neuwrocoris 
rotundatus, Heer. 

Hab. Eocene shales about six miles north of Rifle, Colorado, 
sent by Dr. S. M. Bradbury. Found at the same place as 
Philorites, &amp;e. 

The species is dedicated to the eminent authority on fossil 
insects and also on living Hemiptera. 


CorEIDE (HEMIPTERA). 
Jadera (2) intertta, sp. nov. 
Length about 65 mm. ; breadth of abdomen about 1:65, of thorax 


about 1°75; antenne 4:3 mm.; hind tibia a little over 3 mm. Head 
and thorax dark reddish brown; abdomen paler, with submarginal 


Jadera (?) interita. 
A. Hemielytron. B. Head with appendages. C, Abdomen. 


quadrate spots, five on each side; antenne and legs brown; hemi- 
elytra with a dark pattern as shown in the figure, but otherwise 
pallid, the membrane wholly invisible. Rostrum reaching to base of 
abdomen. Antenne very slender, with a slender club; approximate 
length of joints in »:—(1) 500. (2) 13860. (3) 1200. (4) 1100. Legs 
slender, the femora somewhat thickened; width of hind femora about 
middle 425 p, of hind tibiee at apex 187. 

This resembles Corizus guttatus, Scudd., from the Green River 
shales of Wyoming, but in some material from Green River in 
the Museum of Yale University I have seen what I suppose to be 
C. guttatus, and it is certainly a different insect. The tegmina 
or hemielytra of C. guttatus (type) were not preserved, so it is im- 
possible to say what pattern they may have had. The present 
insect is hardly a Corizus ; the last antennal joint is too slender, 
and the hind tibiew are too long and slender. Jadera (J. hemato- 
loma, H. Schf.) agrees much better, even having a rather similar 
elytral pattern, but it is a broader insect than the fossil, with 
shorter legs. ;

172 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Funcorip® (HEMIPTERA). 
KOFULGORELLA, gen. nov. 

A small Fulgorid, with comparatively elongate tegmina, the costa 
arched basally, but gently coneave about the middle; outer margin 
very oblique. The venation is very well marked by dark lines, the 
veins being broadly pigmented. The homologies of the different 
veins in various genera of Fulgoride seem to be rather obscure, but 
as I interpret them in the present case, the venation is as follows : 
subcosta distinct from radius, ending on costa a little beyond the 
middle of the, and having one oblique branch to, costa; radius 
straight, branched terminally as shown in the figure ; media branch- 
ing beyond middle of wing, and enclosing a small fusiform cell ; 
cubitus branching near middle of wing; two cross-nervures from 
cubitus to media, and two from cubitus to first anal, the latter before 
middle of wing; series of gradate veins in the subapical field very 
well marked, consisting of a series of oblique transverse veins, one 
following the other, between the longitudinal nervures. 

I failed to associate this with any living or fossil genus, and 
so sent a sketch to Mr. K.P. Van Duzee, who kindly replied that 
it agreed with nothing known to him. It has a general resem- 
blance to Oliarus and its allies, but is remarkable for the shape 
of the tegmen and the regularity of the gradate veins. 


Hofulgorella bradburyi, sp. nov. 
Tegmen about 8 mm. long and 24 broad; with dark veins, and the 
apex broadly infuscated. No other parts preserved.

Hab. Eocene shales about six miles north of Rifle, Cororado ; 
received from Dr. §. M. Bradbury. The locality is the same 
as that from which Philorites and other Diptera have been 
described. 

AGRIONIDM (ODONATA). 
Enallagma mortuella, sp. nov. 

Head and thorax black ; abdomen, at least as far as middle, warm 
red-brown above, pallid at sides, a ventral band and the sutures darker 
brown, no sign of any black saddles on the distal ends of the seg- 
ments, such as are usually seen in modern species. Legs pale red- 
dish, the femora at least largely black, the tibiae with short black 
bristles, quite as in the living species. Wings clear, the veins black 
or almost; stigmata warm red-brown with heavy black margins, alike 
on upper and lower wings. Length of anterior wings 19 mm., nodus 
to centre of stigma 11 mm.; length of posterior wings 174 mm. ; 
eleven postnodal cross-veins in anterior and nine in posterior wings. 


FOSSIL INSECTS FROM COLORADO. 173 


Upper side of quadrangle longer than inner ; upper and lower sides of 
stigma subequal; base of subquadrangle (hind wing) nearly (a small 
fraction basad) even with the midmost point between antenodal 
cross-veins* ; anterior cross-veins far apart, the cell they bound being 
over four times as long as deep, much as in the living LH. segnatum 
and fischert; Cu, having its origin and course entirely as in Hnal- 
lagma (consequently not as in Telagrion). 

This will not go in either of Kellicott’s divisions (‘Odonata of 
Ohio,’ p. 82), since both bands and spots referred to are wholly 
absent. So far as the colour of the abdomen goes, the species 
should be placed in Amphiagrion, but the generic characters of 
the tenth abdominal segment remain unknown. Icannotsee any 
postocular spots or band, but am not quite positive that these were 
absent. The size agrees better with Hnallagma than Amphiagrion. 

Regarded as an Enallagma, the fossil would come nearest, by 
its coloration, to the little group of E. signatum, fischeri, and pollu- 
tum, and it is noteworthy that it also falls here by the shape of 
the cell bounded by the antenodal cross-veins. (H. civile, hageni, 
and carunculatum have this cell much shorter.) 

The cells between the quadrangle and the level of the nodus 
are four in the anterior and three in the posterior wings; there 
are four cells between M, and M, before the doubling begins; 
the poststigmatal cells are four in the upper and three in the 
lower wings. The subnodus is very oblique. The brace-vein is 
distinct, and M, is conspicuously angled thereat. The lower side of 
the stigma is broad, bordering a trifle more than one cell; in 
most of the modern species it borders conspicuously less than 
one cell, but in the anterior wings of a female taken by Mr. G. L. 
Garlick at San Geronimo, New Mexico, belonging either to HL. 
annexum or calverti, the stigma is as in the fossil. No doubt the 
longer stigma is a primitive character. 

In my table in Amer. Journ. Sci., July, 1908, pp. 71-72, this 
runs to Agrion mascescens, Scudder, but it is smaller than that 
species, and differs in the position of the base of the sub- 
quadrangle. The difference in size can hardly be sexual, as the 
type of mascescens was a male. There is no doubt that it is very 
close to mascescens, and it may be that the difference is due to 
variation, but it seems preferable to treat it as distinct. The 
abdomen of mascescens is described as colourless. 

Hab. Miocene shales of Florissant, Station 1388, 1908 
(George N. Rohwer). 

Breronipm (Diptera). 
Bibto atavus, sp. nov. 

?. Length about 10 mm.; wings 83; head, thorax, and legs 

black, the dorsum of thorax browner; abdomen dusky ferruginous. 


_* In Amer. Journ. Sci., July, 1908, p. 72, there is a short table relating to 
this character, but by some unfortunate accident ‘ quadrangle ” is printed in 
place of subquadrangle. ; 


174 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Wings mainly clear, but with the costal region broadly fuliginous, 
this narrowing toward the apex, but including the whole of the third 
vein; veins thick, dark reddish-brown. In venation this agrees with 
Bibio as figured by Williston (N. A. Dipt. p. 142, f. 4), except that 
the basal section of the third vein (from anterior cross-vein to first 
vein) is shorter, and the cross-vein between the fourth and fifth is a 
trifle longer. The hind femora are slender, and only about 2 mm. long. 

The male, as in modern species, has swollen anterior femora. 
In this sex the dark colour of the wings appears to be redder and 
more suffused. 

This is a perfectly typical Bibio, such as may be caught in 
Colorado to-day, even to the structure of the anterior legs in the 
male. 

Hab. Miocene shales of Florissant, very abundant. The 
Bibionide from earlier American Tertiaries belong to the less 
specialized genus Plecia. I learn from Prof. Melander that a 
yellowish Plecia was collected in the Florissant shales by 
Scudder. 

Bibio dubius, Bellardi, is later than the fossil B. dubius 
(Germar) Giebel, but as the latter was originally described (in 
1837) under Phthiria, and is doubtfully a Bibio, the name of the 
Mexican species can probably remain. 

Bibio gracilis, Walker, List Dipt. Brit. Mus. 1848, p. 123 
(Canada and N.H.) is a homonym of B. gracilis, Unger, 1841. 
Walker’s species may be called Bibio slossone, n.n., having been 
added to the United States fauna by Mrs. A. T. Slosson.

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW LASIOCAMPID MOTH 
FROM TURKESTAN. 


By Oscar Joun (St. Petersburg, Russia). 
(PuaTtE V.) 


Epicnaptera alice, nov. sp. 

. Male. Head, collar, patagia and thorax thickly and evenly 
covered with woolly, mouse-coloured hair. Palpi bushy, of a darker 
hue, forming together with the hair of the frons a muzzle-like pro- 
minence. Antennz- pectinate, yellowish brown. Abdomen dorsally 
in its proximal part haired as the thorax, distally, on the sides and 
on the under side covered with short ochreous hair. Legs mouse- 
grey, woolly-haired. Wings of the typical form, external margin 
even, hind wings undulated near apex only. General colour of 
fore wings same as of thorax, with a brownish tinge in the middle 
area. The pattern is much the same as in the other species of the 
genus, the inner and elbowed lines consisting of dark-brown dots. 
Stigma in cell distinct, dark brown. The pale subterminal line 
suffused, running straight from costal to inner margin and bordered 
outwardly with a dark shade. Hind wings of the same ground 


176 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


colour, paler in the inner portion of the basal area and showing a 
pale suffused triangle extending from apex to anal angle, on which 
latter it rests with its base. Under side of fore wings coloured as 
the upper side in its outer area and yellowish-grey in the middle and 
basal areas. Transverse lines more or less distinct. Hind wings 
with their upper basal half dark, embordered by a curved dark-brown 
stripe or throughout of a dark-brown coloration; outer half as on the 
upper side, anal portion pale grey. Length of fore wing 124 to 13 mm. 

Three male specimens were captured by Mr. S. Malysheff 
near Baigacum, Syr-Darja, on April 17th, 20th and 21st, 1908. 
Two specimens are in my collection, and the third one was 
destroyed for dissecting purposes. Female unknown. 

There is no doubt of this species being quite distinct from 
all others of the genus Epicnaptera, Rbr. known from the Pale- 
arctic region, i.e. ilicifolia, L., arborea, Blocker,* tremulifolia, 
Hb., suberifolia, Dup. and glasunovi, Gr.Gr. The fittest place 
in the system for this new species, which is the most divergent, 
would be after glasunovi, with which it has the almost even 
margin of the wings in common. HZ. alice differs from glasunovi 
not only in size, being considerably smaller, but also in colora- 
tion (HZ. glasunovi is orange-yellow). 

I dedicate this new species to Miss Alice Tottien, of St. 
Petersburg. 


DRAGONFLIES IN 1908. 
By W..d. liucss, BoA. Bic, 


Durina the season of 1908 very little of fresh interest was 
noted in connection with the British dragonflies. The season 
seemed late in commencing, the first dragonflies seen by myself 
being on May 17th. On that date I met with Pyrrhosoma 
nymphula at the Black Pond on Esher Common, Surrey, where 
also I saw a specimen of Libellula quadrimaculata hanging to its 
nymph-skin, at the time too weak apparently for flight. On 
May 24th at the same place P. nymphula and Hnallagma 
cyathigerum were fairly numerous, and I captured a male 
Cordulia enea in the same neighbourhood. Three days later | 
received from H. Hart a female Libellula depressa taken in a 
garden in the outskirts of Kingston-on-Thames. On the last 
day of the month a female Pyrrhosoma tenellum was captured 
at the Black Pond, this being an early date, for my previous 
earliest record seems to be June 9th.t 

In the New Forest from June 9th to June 16th there were 
noticed at least:—Agrion mercuriale, both sexes; P. nymphula 
and Calopteryx virgo, numerous, and L. depressa, fairly so; Orthe-

A. mercuriale was in yet another new locality—near Holmsley. 
Search was made for Gomphus vulgatissimus in its known locality 
along one of the streams in the southern part of the Forest, 
without success: it was probably but just emerging, or there 
may not have been sufficient sun for it. Two empty nymph- 
skins were found, however, on the bank of another perfectly 
distinct stream, also in the south of the Forest. 

On June 8th in the New Forest O. cerulescens and P. nym- 
phula were found held in captivity by Drosera intermedia, one of 
the Sundews. Insects of this size are usually caught by the 
wings which become useless when smeared with the tenacious 
gum from the tentacles. These dragonflies were alive and 
could not, I suppose, have been employed as food by the 
plant, unless the tip of the abdomen or some other nutritious 
part had been near enough to the tentacles to be secured 
and attacked. No doubt such captured dragonflies would soon 
die of starvation. On August 19th, also in the Forest, an 
O. cerulescens was caught by the tip of a wing, but so tenacious 
was the gum that it had to struggle to escape. 

During a week-end visit to Bedford (July 10th to July 12th) 
Agrion puella was found between Bromham and Kempston, 
and near Milton Ernest; while in the second locality Ischnura 
elegans was secured also. 

On June 14th I received from H. Towell a living male of 
Aischna cyanea taken in Teddington, Middlesex. It was teneral 
in condition, but is worthy of note on account of the date, as even 
July 1st would be considered quite early for the species. It was 
captured indoors and was probably bred in the water of an old 
gravel pit close at hand. A specimen was taken on July 24th 
near Albury on the North Downs in Surrey. On September 9th 
I watched a male settle on the hedge-side at Shotover Hill, Oxon. 
The weather was so poor that the insect allowed me to approach 
and without any difficulty to take it with my fingers. Mr. N. P. 
Fenwick, Jnr., took one on October 18th near Esher Common, 
this being the last of which I heard—more than four months 
after the first. On July 25th H. Hart shewed me a female 
Aischna grandis taken in the Cemetery, Kingston-on-Thames. 

In the New Forest, from August 1st to September 4th, the 
species noted were:—Cordulegaster annulatus, O. cerulescens, C. 
virgo, P. tenellum, Platycnemis pennipes, A. mercuriale, Sympetrum 
scoticum, Lestes sponsa, I. elegans, L. quadrimaculata, Sympetrum 
striolatum, Afschna mixta, At. cyanea, and EH. cyathigerum. 

In the autumn Esher Common and the Black Pond within 
its boundaries were several times visited with the following 
results:—September 5th, a poor day, S. scoticum common, 
S. striolatum a few, E. cyathigerum several, P. tenellum a few, 
also a few A’schne; October 4th, there were seen P. tenellum

one female, E. cyathigerum one male and one female, S. strio- 
latum and S. scoticum very common, also an Aschna or two; 
October 11th, HL. cyathigerwm one male, S. scoticum very common, 
S. striolatum ; October 18th, S. striolatum common, S. scoticun 
very common. 

As regards late occurrences Mr. F. W. Campion tells me of 
the capture of a male L. depressa on September 7th at Ching- 
ford in Eissex, and I took a male ZL. quadrimaculata on August 
7th near Beaulieu River in the New Forest. My last dragonfly 
experience for the season was on November 1st when several 
S. striolatum were seen in the New Forest. 


ON THE TRIMORPHISM OF PYRRHOSOMA NYM- 
PHULA (FEmate). 


By F. W. &amp; H. Campton. 


Two important variations from the normal decoration of 
P. nymphula (female) have been known to entomologists for 
many years, and at one time each form was accorded separate 
specific rank. In one of them (var. fulvipes) the black markings 
on the abdomen are greatly reduced in extent, and in the other 
(var. melanotum) they cover practically the whole of the dorsal 
surface. 

Var. fulvipes (Steph.). 

Agrion fulvipes is thus described by Stephens :— 

“Sp. 11. fulvipes. Sanguinewm, nigro-eneo pictum, pedibus rufo- 
fulvis. (Long. corp. 17 lin.; Exp. Alar. 24 lin.) 

“Ag. fulvipes. Steph. Nomen. 2d edit. col. 113. 

‘Head brassy, front red, with two black streaks; thorax brassy 
above, with a slightly interrupted yellowish-red streak on each side, 
the sides themselves and beneath reddish-yellow, with brassy sutures ; 
abdomen blood-red, the five basal segments each with two transverse 
brassy streaks at the apex, the remainder brassy above, with the sides 
and apex red; legs tawny-red ; wings hyaline, stigma pale red. Some- 
times all but the two basal segments of the abdomen are brassy above. 

“Taken at Coombe wood, and near Ripley, in June.”—Ill. Brit. 
Ent. vi. Mand. p. 75 (1836). 

A practical interpretation of this description is afforded by a 
very immature female of P. nymphula contained in the Stephens 
Cabinet in the British Museum (Natural History) ; attached to 
it is the printed name ‘‘fulvipes Step.,” and the well-known 
small oval ticket which distinguishes Stephens’s own specimens. 

Fulvipes varies a little in detail, but it may be separated 
from the normal female by the reduced markings on segments - 
two, three, and four. On two the mid-dorsal black line is very 
weak, and the apical crown-shaped spot is replaced by a wide 


THE TRIMORPHISM OF PYRRHOSOMA NYMPHULA. 179 


bifureation of the median line, but there is no connection with 
the circlet at the apical suture. Segments three and four are 
often similar to number two, but when, as sometimes happens, 
the median line is continued through the bifurcation to the 
circlet, an anchor-shaped spot is produced, the stock of the 
anchor being represented by the circlet. Segments one and five 
to ten appear to be normal and constant. 

The legs of Stephens’s specimen are, as stated in the descrip- 
tion, tawny-red, and so are the legs of a more mature example 
of the same form taken at Folkestone by Mr. O. Thomas on 
May 15th, 1892, also in the Museum; but in all the other speci- 
mens which we have seen the legs are black, as in the teneral and 
adult states of normal males and females. 

This form is quite common. An example from Folkestone 
has been already mentioned, as well as two Surrey localities 
given by Stephens. Mr. W. J. Lucas has shown us a specimen 
bred from a Surrey nymph in May, 1900, and another taken on 
Esher Common on June 10th of the same year. We have the 
form from Epping Forest (June 16th, 1907; June 14th, 1908 ; 
and May 9th, 16th, and 30th, 1909). The British Museum pos- 
sesses a specimen from De Selys’ Collection, and another from 
Germany presented by Mr. W. F. Kirby, and collected during 
July, 1887. 

Var. melanotum (De Selys). 

This uncommon form has been excellently figured by Mr. 
W. J. Lucas (Entom. 1901, pl. i. fig. 8), and more recently Mr. 
K. J. Morton has restored to it its Selysian name, which had 
been overlooked (ibid. 1908, p. 388). We observe from Mr. 
Lucas’s paper on the Dale Collection (Ent. Mo. Mag. 1909, p. 82) 
that that collection contains at least one specimen of melanotum. 
Another example is in the Stephens Cabinet; it carries the 
usual oval ticket, and a printed label reading ‘‘ Lincolniense 
Step.” It is probable that De Selys saw this insect when he 
consulted the Stephens Cabinet in 1845, for the following entry 
appears in the synonymy of Agrion minium given in his ‘ Re- 
vision of the British Libellulide,’ published in the following 
year :—‘‘ A. lincolniense, Steph. Catal. and Ill. (partim: the 
young female).”’ The courtesy of Mr. Lucas has enabled us to 
compare with Stephens’s specimen an example of eneatum taken 
in the New Forest on June 5th, 1900, with the result that the 
comparison has established complete agreement. 

Agrion lincolniensis is set out in Stephens’s ‘ Catalogue’ as a 
separate species, thus: ‘‘3418. 9, Lincolniensis. Dale MSS.” 
As no description is given, of course the bare name cannot stand. 
Afterwards, in his ‘ Illustrations,’ Stephens wrongly identified 
this distinct insect with Agrion chloridion (Charp.), and sunk the 
name lincolniense as a synonym of that species. But it is clear 
that the dragonfly to which Charpentier gave the name chloridion 


180 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


was, in both its sexes, Hrythromma naias (Hansem.). Indeed, 
when describing melanotum, De Selys perceived the danger of that 
form being confused with immature H. naias (female), and drew 
particular attention to the characters by which the two females 
were to be distinguished. 

Stephens’s confusion was perpetuated by Evans, and the figure 
of Hrythromma chloridion (female) given in ‘British Libelluline’ 
(pl. 5, fig. 6), and stated to have been taken from a specimen in 
Stephens’s Cabinet, may be regarded as representing, though 
very inadequately, the particular insect still in the collection. 

: it appears, therefore, that the synonymy of the variety stands 
thus :— 
Agrion lincolniensis, Stephens, Syst. Cat. Brit. Ins. i. p. 307, 
no. 3418 (1829). 

Erythromma chloridion, Evans, Brit. Lib. p. 16, pl. 5, fig. 6 
(1845). 

Pyrrhosoma minium var. female melanotum, De Selys, Bull. 
Acad. Belg. (2), xli. p. 1298 (1876). 

Pyrrhosoma nymphula var. female eneatum, Lucas, Entom. 
Xxxlv. p. 68, pl. 1, fig. 3 (1901). 

Lincolnshire must now be added to the other known English 
localities, viz. Dorset and the New Forest. Extra-British locali- 
ties which have been given are Madrid and the Sierra Albarracin, 
in Spain, and Corfu.

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


DEFERRED EMERGENCE OF HUPITHECIA TOGATA.—Although many 
species of Lepidoptera belonging to most diverse families are known 
in certain seasons, or even habitually, to pass more than one year in 
the pupal state, Iam not aware whether this habit has before been 
noticed in the case of the “pugs.” The following note may therefore 
be of interest:—In the winter of 1907, in response to an advertisement 
in this Journal, I purchased from a collector in Perth one dozen pups 
of the above species. The cocoons were placed in a breeding-cage kept 
in a lavatory in the house, and in 1908 nine imagos emerged on the 
following dates:—Two on May 24th, one on the 25th, two on the 
27th, two on the 28th, one on the 29th, and one on the 30th. As no 
more emerged, I concluded that there had been a death-rate of 25 per 
cent. On clearing out the cage preparatory to a journey to Scotland 
last autumn (1908), I noticed that one of the pupe, as seen through 
the partially opened cocoon, did not appear to be dead, so this and 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 183 


all the others were returned to the cage, which was taken in August 
to Scotland, in September to Lyme Regis, and was brought back to 
London in October. No Hupithecia larve were taken by me last 
season. On May 9th of this year a very fine specimen of FH. togata 
emerged and another, equally fine, on May 16th, two out of twelve 
having thus spent two years in the pupal stage. Whether the 
twelfth is dead or is deferring its emergence till 1910 remains to be 
seen. I do not know whether this is the usual habit of the species, 
or whether it is exceptional. The breeding-cage was kept indoors, 
and certainly would have been at a higher average winter tempera- 
ture inside a house in London than the pupe would have experienced 
in the pine-woods of their native home in Scotland, so the deferred 
emergence cannot be ascribed to refrigeration. — R. Mernpona; 
6, Brunswick Square, W.C., June 3rd, 1909. 


THE “LARGE Copper” ButTtTERFLY (CHRYSOPHANUS DISPAR).— 
As no accepted record exists of the oecurrence of this species in 
Britain since 1848, I do not think I can be accused of acting in an 
unscientific manner by trying to re-introduce it through Continental 
specimens. I have, consequently (through the kindly help of Mr. 
J. W. Tutt), turned out a number of the larve of the “ ruéelus”” form 
at Wicken Fen, and I ask the support of all entomologists to preserve 
specimens from capture for some years to come, in order to see if this 
beautiful species can be re-established. It will also be interesting to 
see if in the course of a few generations any reversion to the British 
form “dispar” might occur. I hear that an attempt is also being 
made to introduce the other ‘dispar’ (Lymantria) at the same 
place, so British (?) records of this will also be valueless.—G. H. 
VERRALL; Sussex Lodge, Newmarket. 


THe British Raprarup#.—Referring to Mr. Claude Morley’s 
notes on the British species of Raphidia (Kntom. June, 1909, 
pp. 141-3), I may say that xanthostigma is distinctly the com- 
monest species of the genus in Yorkshire, and cannot in any way be 
called rare. In my own experience it is not at all uncommon in the 
Wharncliffe Woods, near Sheffield; and in the Wheatley Woods, 
Doncaster, one can almost always rely on beating it out any suitable 
day at the end of May, or early in June. I have specimens, too, 
taken in different years at Skipwith, near Selby, by the Rev. C. D. 
Ash. Outside our county, Mr. G. W. Mason has sent it to me from 
Wrawby Moor, Lincolnshire; and I have taken it in Chippenham 
Fen, Cambridgeshire, Of notata I have four fine specimens, all 
taken on the same day in Bishop’s Wood, near Selby, its other 
recorded Yorkshire localities being York (R. McLachlan), and Haw 
Park, Wakefield. Outside our county I have taken it in the New 
Forest. Miss Alderson has sent me specimens from Sherwood 
Forest, Notts, where she finds it not uncommonly, and I have several 
from Gosfield in Essex, taken by the late Mr. Alfred Beaumont. 
Neither cognata nor maculicollis are as yet recorded for Yorkshire, 
but the latter has for so many years been known to occur in abundance 
in the Oxshott (Surrey) district, that it was a surprise to read that 
Mr. Morley regarded it as ‘apparently confined to the New Forest.”

184 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


THE RHoPALOCERA OF JAvA.—Publication of the first of a series 
of illustrated monographs on Java butterflies has been recently 
announced. It treats of the Pieride, and is by M. C. Piepers and 
P. C. Snellen, with the collaboration of H. Fruhstorfer. The 
publisher is Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague, Holland. 


NorTEs ON THE Lire-HIstorY oF Capys Dissunotus. — Some 
years ago Mr. A. D. Millar, of Durban, Natal, discovered the 
above-named butterfly which has, I believe, since been described, 
although it does not appear in Mr. R. Trimen’s book on the 
‘ Butterflies of South Africa.’ The egg is laid upon the outside of 
the pod of the plant Protea hirta. The young larva, which is nearly 
black in colour, after leaving the egg-shell, immediately bores into 
the pod, which is then green and soft, feeding and making a tunnel 
in a downward direction. There is not very much change in the 
colour of the larva, but as it increases in size it gradually becomes 
lighter. When full-grown it is about one inch in length, very fat, 
slug-like in shape, and very much resembles Cossus ligniperda in 
colour when about half-grown. Having made a hole for the escape 
of the imago it changes into a brown pupa inside the pod. Like 
many of the Lycnide, both the larva and pupa are nearly always 
found accompanied by small brown ants which do not in any way 
injure either. The butterfly emerges about ten to fourteen days 
after the change to the pupal state. The plant grows upon the sides 
and tops of hills about one thousand feet above sea-level at Pinetown, 
Natal, some ten miles from Durban, and I have no doubt at other 
places as well. Those plants growing near the top of the hills are 
most favoured by the butterfly, and very few larvee were found in the 
pods near the base of the hills. The pods vary very much in size, 
and as the larva does not leave the one it first enters to go into 
another, this accounts for the great difference there is in the size of 
the perfect insect ; the large pods producing fine large insects, and 
the small ones just the reverse, in fact, some of the former are 
double the size of the latter. I never found more than one larva in 
a pod, and by the time the larva is full-fed the part of the pod it is 
then feeding upon is as hard almost as any wood. When I first 
found these larves I opened several of the pods, took out the larvae 
which I thought were going to pupate and put them in a chip box 
to do so. The following day I was very much surprised to find, first 
that the ants had found them out and got into the chip box (where 
they came from, I don’t know), and secondly, that out of ten larve 
only four remained—the other six had bored through the box. The 
fugitives I found near the top of the wall of the room in which I rear 
caterpillars, and the ants up there with them. In spite of feeding 
in pods the larve are still ichneumoned, and I have bred a good 
number of these parasitic flies. I found in all about thirty larve, and 
in March last reared about twenty-four specimens ; the remainder of 
the larvee were ichneumoned.—J. F. Leiau, F.E.S; Durban, Natal, 
May Ist, 1909. 


SHort Duration oF Haa-staGe or A. utMATA.—On Tuesday, 
June 15th, I took A. wlmata plentifully. A female began laying ova 
in a glass-bottomed box late in the afternoon and during the evening.

{ was, however, somewhat surprised to find on the following Monday 
morning that the greater number had hatched out. This certainly 
seemed a very short time for duration of the egg-stage—five and a 
half days.—(Rev.) J. E. Tarsat; Fareham, Hants, June 24th, 1909. 


OccuRRENCE OF P. monETA.—For the last eight years I have 
looked out plants of Delphiniwm in this neighbourhood for traces of 
the larve of P. moneta without success. This month, however, I 
have found or had brought to me sixteen cocoons, so that the species 
is evidently still extending its range. It has been taken in the 
county for some years, but to my own knowledge not so far west.— 
(Rey.) J. E. Tarpat; Fareham, Hants, June 24th, 1909.

CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


EURYMENE DOLABRARIA IN CUMBERLAND.—As there have been 
few records of this moth in the North of England, it may perhaps 
be of interest to record that I captured a specimen on the wing, on 
June 3rd, at Tarn Lodge.—GrorcEe B. RournEpGE; Tarn Lodge, 
Headsnook, Carlisle, June 4th, 1909. 


GONODONTIS (ODONTOPERA) BIDENTATA AB. NIGRA IN SuRREY.—I 
have to record the capture, by myself, of a male G. ab. nigra 
(Prout) on May 31st, 1909. The specimen was at rest on the tarred 
fence surrounding Waverly Woods, Surrey. Is not this a record for 
Surrey? I have never heard of it being taken so far south. I see 
that Yorkshire and Lancashire are given as localities in ‘ Moths of 
the British Isles,” series ii., p. 278—Crcm Worssam; Hillside, 
St. Albans. 


ARGYROLEPIA SCHREIBERSIANA IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE. — On June 
3rd last I went into Cambridgeshire to look for some A. schrevbers- 
zana, but it was a very cold day, wind north-east, and I did not expect 
to do much good. After examining a great many trunks of elm, I 
was successful in taking two specimens, and was about to return 
home, when I came to a small whitethorn bush, which I beat for 
larve. To my great surprise and pleasure I found three A. schrezbers- 
zana at the first beating, and was successful in taking eighteen in all. 
The cold had evidently driven them into the bush for shelter. I think 
this is a record catch of this rare and pretty little Tortrix for one

CErLASTRINA (CYANIRIS) ARGIOLUS IN MippLEsex.—I am glad to 
say that after an absence of six years C. argiolus has turned up again 
in our garden during the second fortnight of May, flying around the 
flowering holly-trees in some numbers. It appears also to have been 
generally common in this part of Middlesex, and I have seen several 
in the gardens of Woodridings, Pinner, and Eastcote, while just over 
the border, at Eastbury, in Oxhey Woods, it was appearing singly 
among the wild hyacinths on the 22nd. I may add that I have 
never seen an example of the autumn generation here, though we 
have plenty of flowering ivy. The common butterflies, P. brassica, 
P. rape, and C. pamphilus have never been so abundant in my 
recollection. _H. Rownanp-Brown; Oxhey Grove, Harrow Weald, 
June 20th, 1909. 


PANCHLORA NiIvEA, L.—A specimen of this pretty cockroach was 
brought, in the beginning of this month, from Jamaica to Cupar, 
among bananas. It was exceedingly lively when I got it. One 
could not but admire how closely it was adapted to its environment. 
A little less than the “ blackbeetle” of our kitchens, it was hardly 
thicker than a playing-card, of a pale green, with transparent teg- 
mina of a lighter shade. It would be seen with difficulty in the 
crevices of the plant. The specimen has been identified by Mr. 
Grimshaw, of the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, where it is 
placed for preservation —Hrnry H. Brown; Cupar Fife, June 19th, 
1909. 


SOCIETIES. 


EntTomonoaican Society or Lonpon.— Wednesday, May 5th, 1909. 
—Dr. F. A. Dixey, M.A., M.D., President, in the chair.— Mr. 8. A. 
Neave exhibited three specimens of a remarkable Cistrid fly belonging 
to the genus Spathicera, Corti, captured on the carcase of a rhinoceros 
shot by him near Fort Jameson, N.E. Rhodesia, in February, 1908. 
He pointed out the extreme rarity of individuals of this genus in the 
imago state, though Cistrid larve had long been known and frequently 
recorded in the intestinal canal of Rhinoceros bicornis, and recently 
Prof. Sjéstedt had succeeded in rearing one individual from a larva, 
described by him under the name Meruensis. This seemed also to be 
the first recorded occasion on which the adult insect had actually 
been observed to be following the rhinoceros, and it was of some 
interest in this connection that both sexes were represented (two 
males, one female).—Mr. H. St. J. Donisthorpe brought for exhibition 
examples of Formica exsecta, Nyl., from Parkhurst Forest, Isle of 
Wight, and from the same locality Dinarda hagensi, Wasm., hitherto 
only observed (with the same ant) in Britain at Bournemouth by the

exhibitor; also Tetramoferia donisthorpet, Kieffer, n. sp., and 7’. femo- 
ralis, Kieffer, n. sp., taken by himself with Tetramoriwm cespitum, L., 
at Whitsand Bay, Cornwall; Paracletes cimiciformis, taken with 
T. cespitum, L., at Barnes Head, Cornwall; and Antennophorus 
pubescens, Wasm., a species new to Britain, taken on Lasius flavus at 
Whitsand Bay.— Mr. W. E. Sharp exhibited examples of the 
following Coleoptera from the West of Ireland to illustrate the pre- 
valence of colour variation in that region :—Carabus nemoralis, Mill., 
C. granulatus, L., C. arvensis, ¥., Notiophilus aquaticus, F., N. bigut- 
tatus, L., Leistus ferrugineus, L., and Corymbites cupreus var. erugt- 
nosus, EF. Mr. H.St. J. Donisthorpe also showed three melanic forms 
of Carabus nitens, C. arvensis, and Pterostichus dimidiatus from the 
New Forest; all quite black.—Mr. Sharpe, explaining his exhibit, 
said that in his opinion these dark forms were racial, and represented 
the survival of an older race, and that the melanism was not due to 
protective necessities, derived from the environment of the localities 
in which the several species existed. — Mr. H. Rowland-Brown ex- 
hibited a series of Pzeris mannt, Mayer, from Le Vernet, Pyrénées- 
Orientales, and called attention to the superficial differences which 
presented themselves when compared with imagines of P. rape@.— 
Mr. EH. C. Bedwell exhibited a series of Cassida fastuosa taken by him 
on Box Hill, Surrey, mostly from the leaves of young foxgloves.—Dr. 
G. B. Longstaff exhibited a series of thirty-three specimens of Danaida 
chrysippus taken by him in Egypt and the Sudan during January and 
February, 1909. Two taken at Cairo, one at Kom Ombo, and one at 
Aswan were all typical, but somewhat dark. A few other specimens 
were seen at each of these localities, but none of them had white 
hind wings. At Kharttim, where the butterfly was fairly common, 
twenty-five specimens were taken; of these two might be described 
as typical, though lighter than the Egyptian specimens ; in eight the 
veins near the middle of the hind wings were dusted with white 
scales; in seven the centre of the hind wings was more or less 
white, as in Moore’s alcippoides; while seven might be described as 
typical alcippus, Cram. One specimen only was seen of the form 
dorippus, Klug, and this had the hind wings almost entirely white— 
f. albinus, Lanz. So far as could be estimated in the field, three- 
fourths of all the specimens seen at Kharttim were either alcippus or 
alcippoides. On the White Nile between El Duém and Gebel En 
(lat. 14-124° N.) four specimens were taken, three typical or nearly 
so, one of the alcippus form. These figures are in marked contrast 
to the proportions found by the President among Mr. Loat’s captures 
on the White Nile in lat. 11-43° N.—Mr. T. Bainbrigge Fletcher, R.N., 
exhibited two mimics of D. chrysippus; the females of Hlymnias 
undularis, and of Argynnis hyperbius (niphe), whose males in both 
cases show the ordinary coloration of the genera to which they 
belong. He said that although in the ordinary preserved condition 
the resemblance of these two females to Danaida was rather “ rough 
and ready,” and by no means comparable to the close imitation of 
pattern seen in the female of Hypolimnas (also exhibited), yet under 
natural conditions of flight the likeness between model and mimic 
was exceedingly close and deceptive. — Mr. Fletcher also exhibited 
specimens of a large and conspicuous Mydaid fly, Mydas ruficornis, 


188 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Wied., which show a striking resemblance when on the wing to the 
large and powerfully armed Scoliid wasps so common throughout 
Ceylon; a red spider found on a “bilimbi” tree (Averrhoa bilimbr) ; 
some newly-hatched Mantids closely resembling, both in colour, size, 
and the quick jerky movements, the common leaf-nesting ant, 
Oecophylla smaragdina; examples of a small Pyralid moth, Syngamia 
floridalis, when flying exactly like a Coccinnellid beetle; and a yellow- 
spotted Reduviid bug, Acanthaspis quinquespinosa, Fabr., an interest- 
ing case of warning coloration common to various Carabid beetles 
found in the same locality and situations (under logs, &amp;c.). 
Wednesday, June 2nd, 1909.— Dr. F, A. Dixey, M.A., M.D., 
President, in the chair. Mr. Frank Price Jepson, of Pembroke 
College, Cambridge and Thanet Lodge, Bromley, Kent; Mr. Ernest 
Charles Chubb, of the Rhodesia Museum, Buluwayo, South Africa ; 
Mr, John F', Musham, of 53, Brook Street, Selby, Yorkshire; and Mr. 
Oscar Cecil Silverlock, of ‘ Allington,” Burbage Road, Herne Hill, §.E., 
were elected Fellows of the Society.—Mr. Selwyn Image exhibited an 
example of the North American sawfly, Sirex caudatus, Cresson, 
bred from a larva found at Highbury in a piece of wood, together 
with photographs of the larva and its galleries by Mr. Hugh Main.— 
The Rey. G. Wheeler brought for exhibition a series of Anthocharis 
tages var. bellezina from Aix-en-Provence taken this year, and of 
A. belia from the South of France for comparison; also a series of 
Lycena corydon with dark under sides—the typical form in the south. 
—Lord Walsingham showed two set examples and pupal cases of 
Holocacista riviller, Stn., called by the late Mr. Stainton ‘ The lost 
Pleiad,” because originally described in 1750 and not again found 
before 1870, mining leaves of the grape-vine.—Dr. T. A. Chapman 
exhibited specimens of Callophrys avis, a new species from the South 
of France, first taken by him at Hyéres three years ago, and in the 
following year, and now obtained by him this year from the Pyrénées- 
Orientales; and two examples of Pararge egeria from Southern 
France, with a typical Southern specimen (@geria) and an English 
one (@gerides), for comparison, the French form being as far from 
@gerva in one direction as @gerides is in the opposite, and possibly a 
Mendelian variety.— Dr. T. P. Lucas, who was present as a visitor, 
brought for exhibition a box containing thirty-one species of butterflies 
taken by him in the neighbourhood of Durban in two hours. He 
also gave a short account of the abundance of Lepidoptera at Bris- 
bane, Queensland.—Mr. EH. C. Bedwell exhibited examples of the 
myrmecophilous beetle, Heterius ferrugineus, Ol., from Boxhill, a 
species not recorded from Britain for forty-six years.-—Mr. H. St. J. 
Donisthorpe, specimens of Formica exsecta (one female and two herma- 
phrodites) from Aviemore, pointing out that it had never been recorded 
from Scotland or the North before; specimens of Formica rufa-pratensis 
(two females and two hermaphrodites), pseudogynes and micrergates, 
from Nethey Bridge, Inverness-shire, remarking that this was the 
dominant form there-—Mr. L. Doncaster, a drawer of Abraxas 
grossulariata and its var. lacticolor, illustrating breeding experiments, 
which showed that lacticolor is a Mendelian recessive to grossulariata, 
and that the sex-determinants also behave as Mendelian characters, 
femaleness being dominant; and that males are homozygous (pure)

in respect of sex, females heterozygous.—Mr. J. R. Tomlin, examples 
of Micropeplus celatus, Kr., taken on marshy ground last April, near 
Cloghane, Co. Kerry, by Dr. Norman Joy and himself, an interesting 
addition to a small genus, so far reported only from Germany and 
Sweden.—Dr. G. B. Longstaff, a number of specimens of Coccinella 
11-punctata, L., from the White Nile, taken during a migratory flight 
which lasted from 4.50 p.m. till nearly 6 p.m.; also a Scarabeus taken 
by him on the edge of the desert, within half a mile of the Sphinx, 
belonging to the Arabian species S. compressicornis.—Prof, H. 8, 
Poulton, F.R.S., made the following exhibits :—(a) a beautifully carved 
scarab of about the sixth century B.c., from Upper Egypt, apparently 
copied from Scarabeus sacer; (b) species of two different genera of 
Coccinellide taken in cop. at Tubney, Berks; (c) a collection of 
Diptera from Oxford and the New Forest, ‘with observations and 
captured by Mr. A. H. Hamm; (d) an example of the rare Castniid 
moth, Castnia therapon, Kollar (a Brazilian species) taken flying in 
his conservatory at Broadstone, Dorset, by Dr. A. R. Wallace, F.R.S. ; 
(e) a series of forty-nine females and seven males of Hypolimnas 
misippus from British East Africa, to illustrate the heridarity ten- 
dencies of the female forms; (f) examples of Millerian mimicry in 
Hupleine; (g) and a collection of small moths captured at sea, one 
hundred and ninety miles from, and south-east of, the Cochin China 
coast, sent to him with a short note by Mr. F. Muir and My. J. C. 
Kershaw, Fellows of the Society. Prof. Poulton then made some 
observations on the use of the saw of the sawfly during oviposition, 
supplementary to the discussion on the subject at a previous meeting, 
and also communicated ‘ Notes on the Life-History of Awlacodes 
simplicialis, Snell,” by Mr. Muir and Mr. Kershaw.—Mr. T. Bainbrigge 
Fletcher exhibited a collection of Lepidoptera common to the African, 
Indian and Australian regions, some of them occurring in America 
also, and remarked that it was incredible that, being extremely 
variable, they should retain their specific facies over the wide area of 
distribution in the absence of some fairly constant syngamic connec- 
tion. He also showed a collection from Ceylon of black ants and 
their mimics; a mass of the Cingalese bug, Dysderus cingulatus, 
resembling a flower; and an example of the Coprid beetle, Scarabeus 
gangeticus taken on the wing carrying small winged Diptera of the 
Borboride. He suggested that the flies were rather passengers in 
search of their pabulum than parasites—Mr. Hamilton H. Druce, 
F:L.8., communicated a paper ‘‘On some new and little-known Neo- 
tropical Lycenide.’’— Mr. Claude Morley, F.Z.S., communicated 
‘“A Description of the Superior Wing of the Hymenoptera, with 
a view to give a simple and more certain Nomenclature to the Alary 
System of Jurine.”—Mr. H. St. John Donisthorpe, F.Z.8., read a 
paper “On the Colonization of New Nests of Ants by Myrmeco- 
philous Coleoptera.’”—Mr. F. Enock, F.L.S., read a paper on ‘“‘ New

Jamaica,” with especial reference to the insect fauna of the island, 
notably certain pests allied to the Insecta which had been particular 
objects of study, viz. the cattle ticks. The lecture was fully illustrated 
by lantern-slides, and by specimens brought back by Mr. Newstead. 
The results of the expedition, due to the initiative and support of Sir 
A. L. Jones, will be fully reported upon officially.—Dr. Tinne exhibited 
a series of Cenonympha typhon from various localities to show the

bred from Bournemouth female, including many examples with 
interrupted fascia.—Discussion. Dr. T. A. Chapman opened a dis- 
cussion as to the cause of the scarcity or absence of a species (of 
Lepidoptera) that sometimes follows a period of exceptional abun- 
dance in some particular locality. The opener advanced as a possible 
explanation the theory that abnormal abundance might be due to 
the temporary inactivity of some selective and destructive force ; 
comparatively unprotected individuals would thus be allowed to

escape, and their unprotectedness would be transmitted to and 
accentuated in subsequent broods. Thus, when the selective agency 
again became active, the race would be exceptionally vulnerable to 
its attacks, and the species would be nearly exterminated until it was 
gradually selected up to the average of its protective potentiality, and 
its normal numbers so re-established.—S. J. Benn, Hon. Sec.

all the British ants, he is able to speak with authority on these 
interesting insects. The paper will be of the greatest value to 
students of our Hymenoptera.

Proceedings of the South London Entomological and Natural History

Tue publication of this excellent little annual is always awaited 

with interest, and its advent welcomed, not only by the members of 


192 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


the Society but by many students in entomology and other branches 
of natural history. 

Numerous items of importance are to be found in the abstract of 
the business transacted at the meetings, which are held in the even- 
ings of the second and fourth Thursdays of each month throughout 
the year. : 


The wide range of subjects engaging the attention of the mem-_ 


bers is well illustrated by the five papers printed in the present 
volume. These are:—‘ Effects of Physical and Chemical Agencies 
on Lepidoptera” (H. 8. Fremlin, M.R.C.8., F.E.S.) ; “House Moths” 
(A. Sich, F.E.S.); ‘Notes on Hungarian Butterflies’ (A. H. Jones, 
F.E.S.); “Insects as Carriers of Disease” (H. S. Fremlin, M.R.C.S., 
F.E.S.); ‘Orchids and their Cultivation” (W. J. Kaye, F.E.S.). 
In addition to various other matters of interest adverted to by the 
President (Mr. A. Sich) in his address is an exceedingly able discourse 
on the antiquity of natural history study. 


A Survey and Record of Woolwich and West Kent. Edited by C. H. 
GrintinG, T. A. Incram, M.A., LL.D., B. C. PonkincHorne, 
B.Se., F.C.8. (the late), and others. Pages i-viii and 1-526. 
Woolwich: Labour Representation Printing Co., Ltd. 1909. 


Tuts volume is the result of a remarkable effort of local co- 
operation in scientific study. The South-Hastern Union of Scientific 
Societies having accepted an invitation to hold its Twelfth Annual 
Congress in Woolwich, in June, 1907, a local Committee was formed, 
and it resolved to commemorate the Congress by making a series of 
surveys of the district and publishing them as a local scientific hand- 
book. This resolution has been carried out by the united labour of a 
large number of workers, and the surveys form an invaluable book of 
reference to local students of natural history. 

The Geological Section, pp. 3-30, is edited by W. Whitaker, B.A., 
HRS. BVG:s:. 

The Botanical Section, pp. 31-230, is a Flora of Woolwich and 
West Kent, edited by J. F. Bevis, B.A., B.Sc., and W. H. Griffin. 
More than two thousand species are recorded, with notes on the 
nature of the habitat and actual localities where found, with dates. 
More than half the entries appear here for the first time, and several 
new county records have been established. . 

Mr. J. W. Tutt, F.E.S., has edited the Zoological Section (pp. 231— 
440). In this part the annotated list of Coleoptera runs to 53 pages, 
and comprises over 1200 species; whilst the list of the Lepidoptera, 
with localities, &amp;c., extends to 87 pages. Of Hemiptera, 223 species 
of Heteroptera and 150 of Homoptera are entered; this list is founded 
on the work of Mr. W. West, of Greenwich. Owing apparently to 
a dearth of observers in the past, some orders of the Insecta are 
not mentioned, and Neuroptera is only represented by 8 species of 
Odonata. 

There is also a section on Archeology, a Survey of the Scientific 
Industries along the Thames from the Ravensbourne to the Darenth, 
and a note on Woolwich as a Centre for Photography.

ORTHOPTERA IN 1908. 
By W. J. Lucas, B.A., F.E.S. 


Bur little of special interest seems to have come under ob- 
servation during 1908 in connection with the British Orthoptera. 
All we can say is that we have obtained a little more informa- 
tion as to the range of the species, and that some additions, also 
slight, have been made to our knowledge in regard to their 
habits. 


Harwies.—On August 10th three specimens of Labidura 
riparia, one being a large male, were captured four or five miles 
from the spot on the shore near Bournemouth where they are 
usually found, and on August 12th Mr. A. H. Hamm obtained a 
specimen at a spot between these two localities. In life these 
earwigs are of a dirty cream tint, with a little darker colouring 
in places, and therefore are extremely well hidden from casual 
observation by their resemblance to the pale yellow sand which 
fringes the shore. They do not, however, lay themselves open 
to detection, as they remain in hiding during the day. One of 
those captured on August 10th was set free, when it ran very 
rapidly over the sand and soon found a crevice in which to hide. 
Feeding of course takes place at night. The large male, as well 
as the third one mentioned above, were kept alive under observa- 
tion, being fed on animal food. The male ate rapidly off a 
small portion of kipper given it, and was equally satisfied with 
whiting. It fed freely also for a time off a fragment of rabbit. 
Although it attacked white of egg, it appeared to have no great 
liking for it. On my return they were taken to Kingston, but on 
September 27th the large individual was found to ‘have almost 
entirely consumed the smaller one, although they had been living 
together for some time. In November the survivor paid a visit 
to South Woodford for a week or two, Mr. Main wishing to 
obtain its portrait. At the beginning of December it did not 
appear to be feeding. When food was placed in the box with it 
no movement was made at first, but in one to two minutes 
it roused. itself, waved its antenne, turned towards and then

194 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


approached the food, apparently being always perfectly certain 
with regard to the direction in which it lay. After living in 
captivity over four months it succumbed during the Christmas 
season. 

In September Mr. J. R. le B. Tomlin bottled for me a couple 
of Labia minor at Ledbury, in Herefordshire, but unfortunately 
a beetle ate them. On the occasion of the South London 

Society’s excursion to Oxshott, on Septem- 
ber 19th, Mr. W. J. Ashdown found a dead 
male, and during the Fungus foray of the 
same Society to Oxshott, on October 38rd, 
Mr. 8. R. Ashby obtained another male. 
On September 80th Mr. F. M. Dyke cap- 
tured a male which settled on his hand as 
he was walking along Southwark Street, near 
Blackfriars Bridge (vide vol. xli. p. 273). 
Forficula auricularia, the common earwig, 
seems to be somewhat subject to deformity 
i cha ance lo: in its callipers, and one so affected, taken in 
F. auricularia (x 10). ® garden at Teddington, Middlesex, seems 
of sufficient interest to be figured. The right 
branch of the callipers is normal, of the small rounded type ; 
the left is simple, and gives one the impression that the base 
of it is within the creature’s abdomen. 


Cockroacnes.—Two dark examples of Hctobia panzert were 
found on breaking up a decayed tree-stump by the side of 
Beaulieu River, in the New Forest, on August 14th, and Mr. 
HK. C. Bedwell gave me a female of this species, taken at Deal in 
August, which had its legs pale except for the knees and parts of 
the tarsi. On February 17th I received from Mr. H. Bradshaw 
a lively specimen of Rhyparobia medere, taken the same day in 
a greengrocer’s shop in Berrylands Road, Surbiton. It was 
found in some sea-kale beneath bananas which came from 
the Canary Islands. From Mr. G. T. Lyle I received a speci- 
men of Leucophea surinamensis, which was found crawling about 
on Christmas Day in a hothouse at Bishopstoke, Hants. Is 
this cockroach to become a pest in warm plant-houses in this 
country ? 


Locustips (long-horned grasshoppers).—On August 18th, in 
the New Forest, some wood-ants (Formica rufa) were trying to 
carry away so large an insect as Leptophyes punctatissima. Could 
they possibly have succeeded ? 

Mr. Tomlin obtained Meconema varium in his sweeping-net 
at Streatley on October 2nd. It was obtained from a fence in 
Fassett Road, Kingston-on-Thames, September 18th, and was 
captured on the South London Society’s excursion to the Oxshott 
district on September 19th. The female of a pair taken on this 


DISTRIBUTION OF PAPILIONIDH IN THE HIMALAYAS. 195 


date and put into a box without food ate a great part of the male, 
but whether the latter had died first I cannot say. 

Mr. M. Burr tells me that he took the far from common 
species, Xiphidiwm dorsale, in a swamp near Hastry, Kent, on 
July 26th. A female Locusta viridisstma was taken on the cliff- 
side near Swanage on August 17th. Mr. H. Campion tried very 
hard to find the scarce Platycleis roesellit at Herne Bay, but war 
not successful. 

Acripians (short-horned grasshoppers).—On September 13th 
I paid a visit to Bookham Common in search of Gomphocerus 
rufus, this being the only locality for it with which I am per- 
sonally acquainted. A few of both sexes were obtained in one 
spot, but not without a considerable amount of search. 

G. maculatus, one of the earliest grasshoppers to become 
mature, I captured first at the Devil’s Punch Bowl, Hindhead, 
Surrey, on June 24th. Mr. Tomlin took it at Tubney, Berks, 
on July 5th. 

Stenobothrus bicolor was obtained at Sharnbrook, Bedford- 
shire, on July 11th; on a cliff-side near Swanage on August 
17th; on Shotover Hill, near Oxford, on September 9th; in 
Middlesex, near the Thames side opposite Surbiton, on September 
14th ; and latest on Esher Common, Surrey, on October 11th. 
Mr. Tomlin took it in August at West Malvern, in Herefordshire. 

S. parallelus occurred on a cliff-side near Swanage on August 
17th; Mr. Tomlin took it at West Malvern in August. It was 
found on Shotover Hill on September 9th, and a single female 
was met with as late as October 31st in the New Forest. 

A mature male Mecostethus grossus was taken in the New 
Forest on August 1st, but I do not think I noticed a female till 
August 21st. 

One specimen of the scarce Tettix subulatus was secured on 
August 12th by the side of a pond near Holmsley, in the New 
Forest. The common species, 7’. bipunctatus, Mr. Tomlin took 
at West Malvern in August, and I took one in the New Forest 
on November 1st, this being my last grasshopper captured during 
the season of 1908. 


ON THE PERPENDICULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE 
PAPILIONIDH IN THE HIMALAYAS. 


By W. Harcourt- Bata. 


WuHeEn in the spring of 1897 I availed myself of the oppor- 
tunity of visiting the South-eastern Himalayas in pursuit of 
insects of various orders, I found the Papilionide so much in 
evidence, both as regards the number of species and individuals, 
that I decided to specialise upon this magnificent family of Lepi- 
doptera, and the study of their vertical or perpendicular distri- 

R 2

bution, as hitherto, constituted the pivot upon which I based 
‘my observations and particular line of inquiry. Although the 
Himalayas, according to geographers in, general, consist of five 
‘principal parallel chains or ranges, two of which are situated 
upon the plateau of Thibet, for zoological and botanical purposes 
they are usually considered as including only that particular 
portion known as the central or meridional ridge, on the austral 
or Indian side of the high Asiatic tableland, together with its 
numerous spurs and continuations to the south. On the extreme 
western side the range is bounded by the Indus, where it makes 
a sudden bend and debouches into the plain, while on the east it 
terminates at the romantic gorge of the Brahmaputra or Tsangpo. 
Within these well-defined limits, which extend for about fifteen 
hundred miles in length and vary from one hundred to two 
hundred miles in width, the number of species of Rhopalocera 
possibly falls not far short of one thousand. Of this number, 
indeed, nearly six hundred and fifty different species have already 
been recorded from Sikkim and Western Bhutan alone, as many 
as six hundred and thirty-one having been particularised in the 
admirable ‘‘ List of the Butterflies of Sikkim,” by the late Lionel 
de Nicéville, in the ‘ Gazetteer of Sikkim,’ published at Calcutta 
in 1894; while at least seventy additional species have been 
enumerated from the North-western Himalayas. 

Of the family under consideration in the present paper fifty- 
two species are included in the above list by de Nicéville as in- 
habiting the circumscribed district named, while at least five 
others are known to occur in the Himalayas to the west of 
Nepaul, this interesting intervening country at present being a 
terra incognita to the entomologist. The latter remark also 
applies to the continuation of the chain to the east of Sikkim, 
namely, in Bhutan and South-east Thibet, where the Lepidoptera 
fauna will be found, in my opinion, to approximate more closely 
as regards the purely tropical element with the lower woody, 
hilly districts to the south of the Brahmaputra in Assam. When 
these countries are explored entomologically I have no hesitation 
in saying that the number of Papilionids occurring in the entire 
range of the Himalayas will be eventually increased to quite 
seventy. The number enumerated in the preceding catalogue 
as occurring in Sikkim, alone, far exceeds that existing else- 
where in anything like the same area, not only in the remaining 
portion of the excessively rich Indo-Malayan region, to which 
the Himalayas principally belong, but as regards the still richer 
lepidopterological fauna of the neotropical region in South 
America. For although collectively exceedingly rich in Papi- 
lionide, as well as in other families of Rhopalocera, all the 
larger islands of the East Indian Archipelago belonging both 
to the Indo-Malay and Austro-Malay sections, situated either 
directly under the Equator or in close proximity thereto, upon 


DISTRIBUTION OF PAPILIONIDA/ IN THE HIMALAYAS. 197 


either side, can, individually, rarely produce more than from one 

to two dozen species—that is, from twenty-five to fifty per cent. 

less than is the case in the small Sikkim section of the South- 

eastern Himalayas. Even in the comparatively well-known and 
much more extensive continental district of the Malay Peninsula 

the number of species belonging to this particular family, as 

recorded by Mr. W. L. Distant in his excellent work on the 

‘ Butterflies of the Malay Peninsula,’ falls short of the number 

inhabiting the very circumscribed area of Sikkim by fourteen. 

And what makes this fact the more remarkable still is that the 

latter district is situated not only remote from the Equator, but 

is wholly outside the Tropics besides. This singular superfluity 

-of species, however, is shared by all the other families and sub- 

families of Rhopalocera, with the exception of the smaller 
statistically and more strictly equatorial Hupleine, Elymniine, 
Morphine, and Nemeobiine. Im short, as the late lamented 
Mr. Lionel de Nicéville remarked to me upon the occasion of a 
visit which I paid to him at the Indian Museum in Calcutta, 
‘** Nowhere else in the Kastern Hemisphere will one find butter- 
flies so abundant either in species or individuals.” 

In some measure this is to be accounted for by the continuous 
succession of phytogeographical and climatal conditions pro- 
duced by the temperature and precipitation at different levels, at 
least as regards the number of species ig concerned, and pro- 
vides a somewhat parallel case to the conditions which exist 
in the Alps of Central Europe, the species becoming similarly 
less numerous as one recedes therefrom upon either side. But 
as regards the overwhelming number of individuals of many 
species to be met with in the South-eastern Himalayas another 
set of factors apparently comes into play. Without, however, 
entering here into a discussion as to the cause or contributory 
cause of the latter remarkable phenomena, I will just venture 
the remark that in my opinion the organic competition in the 
shape of animal enemies, chiefly ants, is possibly less severe in 
the Himalayas than it is further south, an assertion founded 
principally on personal observations in Ceylon, where, notwith- 
standing the wonderful richness and marvellous luxuriance of 
the vegetation, butterflies are comparatively very scarce in indi- 
viduals (with a few exceptions), while ants, which probably 
constitute their principal enemies in the adolescent state, are, 
on the other hand, exceedingly abundant there. In this “ Isle of 
Spices,”’ in fact, I found butterflies less plentiful in individuals, 
and the number of species to be procured in a single day 
frequently fewer than in many localities in the South of Eng- 
land. That this was not my experience alone, I may recall the 
fact that the late Sir Greville Smyth, whom I met collecting up 
at Kandy upon various occasions, remarked to me that, although 
he had made several visits to Ceylon, he had always found 


198 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. ~ 


butterflies scarce. This may be an extreme example, but it is 
possible to see as many butterflies in the Sikkim Himalayas in 
the course of twelve hours as in Ceylon during a stay of twelve 
months, if alone we except those wonderful migratory hosts- 
(usually composed of three or four species only) which periodi- 
cally make their appearance, and vanish completely out of sight 
a day or two afterwards. Anyhow, the singular fact remains that 
butterflies are by far more plentiful in species and conspicuous 
in individuals, in certain localities in the Himalayas, than is the 
case in any other portion of the Eastern Hemisphere, inside the 
Tropics or without, and this applies with equal force to the Papi- 
lionide. Indeed, the very first butterfly that I espied on the 
ever-memorable occasion of my premier journey up the ‘ Hills” 
by the diminutive train of the Darjeeling-Himalayan Railway 
from Siliguri was a brilliant, bounding, specimen of Achillides 
paris, this pre-eminently characteristic and extremely exquisite 
group of green-and-blue-spotted, spoon-tailed, Oriental Papilios 
being represented by no fewer than four superb species in the 
immediate neighbourhood of Darjeeling (an additional species 
occurring in the Simla district), where they are popularly known 
to Indo-European and Eurasian residents by the appropriate 
cognomen of ‘‘ Peacocks.” 

The majority of the tropical Himalayan Papilionide, in- 
cluding a couple of gigantic Ornithoptere, are generally of a 
larger average size than anywhere else; especially is this the 
case in extreme wet season forms which fly during the maximum 
phase of the south-west monsoon. Examples of these, I believe, 
exceed the dimensions of the same species (with one or two 
exceptions) elsewhere. These splendid insects, therefore, to- 
gether with several species of immense silk-moths, the latter 
numbering in their ranks the largest species of Heterocera in 
the whole world, Attacus edwardsi, besides other magnificent 
species, provide pre-eminently suitable symbolical lepidoptero- 
logical representatives of the most elevated and stupendous 
mountain system upon this terrestrial sphere. To the student 
of zoogeographical and phytogeographical distribution there is 
no more interesting field for investigation and inquiry than that 
supplied by the Himalayas, which provide in a small compass a 
complete compendium of all the zoogeographical and phyto- 
geographical zones situated upon the horizontal isotherms of the 
earth. This is the case at least with the single exception of the 
equatorial, characterised by its cocoanut palms, which I have 
not seen growing further north than in the neighbourhood of 
the Ganges near Calcutta, where it is crossed by the Tropic of 
Cancer. All the other climatal belts are represented between 
thence and the Arctic Regions with characteristic fauna and 
flora to correspond. 

Although, as I have already alluded to the fact, the Sikkim 


DISTRIBUTION OF PAPILIONIDA IN THE HIMALAYAS. 199 


Himalayas are situated wholly outside the astronomical limits of 
the Tropics (being between 27° 5’ and 28° 10’ north latitude), by 
reason of its sheltered position, equable temperature and super- 
abundant precipitation, the tropical zone is powerfully repre- 
sented in its animal and plant-life, which extends from the 
malarial Terai Jungle and Sal Forest at the foot of the outer 
hills at the low altitude of only about 200 ft. above the sea-level 
to 2500 ft. or thereabouts. To this circumscribed belt the most 
strictly tropical species of butterflies are chiefly confined. Among 
the Papilionide, which are specially characteristic of this zone, 
special mention may be made of the following :—Ornithoptera 
rhadamanthus, Pangerana didoneus, Tamera castor, Menamopsts 
slatert, M. epycides, Isamiopsis teleachus, Paranticopsis megarus, 
P. «wenocles, P. macareus, Pazala glycerion, Pathysa agetes, P. 
antiphates, P. anticrates, Zetides eurypylus, Z. bathycles, Mean- 
drusa evan. While the following, although they belong more 
properly to the fauna of the peninsula, may also be enume- 
rated, namely :—Menelaides aristolochie, Iliades polymnestor, 
Lertias polytes, Orpheides erichthonius, Pathysa nomius, the 
second and fifth of which are only occasional stragglers from 
the plains, and have not been known to perform their metamor- 
phoses within the district under discussion. 

Most of the typical forms of arborescent vegetation extend 
upwards to 5000 ft. or thereabouts, which may be taken to be 
the upper limits of the subtropical zone, between which and the 
one below there is apparently not a great deal of difference 
either in the zoological or the botanical physiognomy, so that 
the fauna and flora are in reality only an extension of the pre- 
ceding, the principal difference consisting in the gradual elimina- 
tion of the strictly tropical element towards the confines of the 
belt above. The majority of the intertropical species of butter- 
flies ascend to various altitudes within this zone, for the most 
part, however, performing their transformations probably below 
4000 ft., though in the imago state some of them may occasion- 
ally be seen considerably higher up the mountain sides, while 
towards the upper limits an entirely new element commences to 
come into existence in the shape of temperate modifications of a 
tropical fauna. 

Between 5000 ft. and 7500 ft. or so the warm-temperate zone 
holds sway with its sombre, dense forests of dark olive-green 
oaks and chestnuts and thick undergrowth of laurels and ferns. 
It is here that some of the most interesting Himalayan Papi- 
lionide have their headquarters, the various species which are 
endemic or nearly so to this particular climatal belt consisting 
exclusively of temperate modifications of tropical forms belong- 
ing to the Indo-Malayan fauna, corresponding to those occurring 
in the more elevated districts of Southern China, most of them, 
indeed, being absolutely identical therewith. The following is a 


200 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


list of these interesting Himalo-Chinese species :—Byasa ravana, 
B. plutonius, B. alcinous, B. latreillii, Panosmiopsis janaka, Achil- 
lides krishna, A. arcturus, A. polyctor, Cadugoides agestor, C. go- 
vindra, Pathysa paphus, Dabasa gyas, Teniopalpus imperialis, and 
Armandia lidderdalit. 

Some of these also occur at equivalent elevations upon 
the plateau of the Cossyas in Assam, where in fact the exceed- 
ingly magnificent 7’. imperialis seems to have its metropolis, 
judging from its more frequent occurrence there than in the 
Himalayas. Darjeeling (where I made my headquarters) at the 
altitude of 7500 ft. above the level of the sea is situated towards 
the upper limits of the warm temperate zone, the mean annual 
temperature being 55° Fahrenheit. Here, as elsewhere on the 
sub-Himalayas or Outer Hills, particularly those which are in 
close proximity to the deep hot tropical valleys, such as the 
Teesta and the Rungeet, several otherwise strictly tropical species 
occasionally ascend to the highest limits of this zone, a complete 
list of them, according to my own observations, being as follows : 
—Ornithoptera cerberus, Pangerana astorion, Panosmiopsis rhe- 
tenor, Achillides paris, Sarbaria ganesa, Iliades agenor, Sainia 
protenor, Charus helenus, C. chaon, Dalchina sarpedon, Zetides 
agamemnon. Three others—Byasa dasarada, B. philoxenus, and 
Dalchina cloanthus—are almost equally characteristic of the 
tropical and temperate zones, the two former occurring regularly 
up to 8000 ft., the latter up to 7000 ft., at least in the North- 
west Himalayas. 

On the outer hills, from 7500 ft. up to fully 10,000 ft. above 
the sea-level, the peculiar Himalo-Chinese element (of which 1 
have given a list), although in decreasing numbers, continues to 
predominate, that is to the extreme confines of the cold-temperate 
zone, with its deciduous trees of Central European aspect and 
appearance, but this is in reality rather owing to a paucity of 
palearctic species of Rhopalocera than to a plentifulness of Indo- 
Chinese forms, and the same phenomenon precisely holds good 
with respect to nearly all the other groups of insects also. In 
the ‘‘interior’’ of Sikkim, however—that is, on the southern 
declivities of the meridional ridge of the great central snow 
peaks—the preceding condition of things begins to become 
reversed as low as 8000 ft., where, owing to a much drier 
atmosphere and a sunnier though colder climate, the temperate 
fauna and flora commence to predominate at a Jower altitude 
than upon the outer hills, where the precipitation is so excessive, 
but the only representative of the palearctic Papilionide which 
exists therein is a local form of the common Papilio machaon, 
which, however, is exceedingly plentiful in certain places. Hven 
here there are several ‘‘ Papilios” of Indo-tropical character, but 
they are all very scarce apparently in individuals. On the 
outer ‘‘hills’’ within the present zone the following may be

enumerated as being indigenous thereto—that is, undergoing 
their metamorphoses there:—Byasa latreillii, Achillides krishna, 
A. arcturus, Teniopalpus imperialis. 

While in the “interior” I have only met with the penulti- 
mate species named, with a certainty, though I occasionally saw, 
but wag not able to procure, specimens of a large black species, 
which I think possibly was the above-mentioned Byasa latreallit 
(better known as P. minereus). This happened near the junction 
of that exceedingly interesting district mentioned by Sir Joseph 
Hooker in his ‘Himalayan Journals,’ which constitutes the 
transitional area between the Indo-Malayan and Palearctic 
regions, in which one may almost in the space of a few yards 
pass at once from a tropical to a temperate fauna and flora. 

Between 10,000 ft. and 12,500 ft., which corresponds to the 
lower alpine zone, the only species which is indigenous therein 
is Papilio machaon,* which is, moreover, confined, as far as my 
experience is concerned, to the lower portion thereof, although 
several wanderers from the tropical zones occasionally pay it a 
visit during warm spells of sunshine at the height of the south- 
west monsoon, but they must invariably soon perish, like the 
locusts which sometimes succumb in swarms among the snow. 
I have thus seen males of Iliades agenor ag high as 11,000 ft. at 
Yatung in the Chumbi Valley, in Thibet, which is physically, 
though not politically, part of the Bhutanese Himalayas. Tropi- 
cal species of other families occasionally soar even higher still 
during exceptional spells of warm sunny weather experienced at 
intervals towards the middle heights, but they none of them 
perform their metamorphoses at anything like these elevations 
in the Himalayas, though they look sufficiently out of place in 
the winged state among the forests of firs and larches which 
clothe the mountains above 10,000 ft., as in like manner near 
the sea-level in Norway. 

Towards the upper limits of the sub-alpine belt—that is, on 
approaching the termination of the forests of conifers—no species 
of Papilionide are apparently indigenous,t but on making an 
exit into the upper alpine or pseudo-arctic zone at 138,000 to 
14,000 ft. or thereabouts, and arriving in the belt of bushes, 
gregarious rhododendrons of various species predominating, 
several species of Parnassius are encountered, which occur from 
thence right up to the perpetual line of congelation. This latter 
phenomenon prevails at an average elevation of from 16,000 to 
18,000 ft. above the sea-level on the southern declivities of the 
meridional ridge of the Central Himalayas in Sikkim, though it 
is as much as from 1000 to 2000 ft. higher on the northern 


* This refers to the South-eastern Himalayas only. In the Simla district 
Dr. G. B. Longstaff has met with Parnassius hardwickei as low as 10,000 ft. 
within the present belt.

or Thibetan side, an anomaly which has been sufficiently explained 
by Sir J. W. Hooker in his well-known ‘ Himalayan Journals.’ 

The snow zone is practically only a continuation of the 
preceding, characterized botanically by its dwarf alpine herbs, 
the same as in the polar regions; while among the Parnassine, 
so typical of the lepidopterological fauna of the more elevated 
mountains of northern Asia and Europe, three species occur in 
Sikkim—Parnassius hardwicket, jacguemonti, and acco; with 
three others in the continuation of the chain towards the north- 
west—Parnassius charltonius, actius, and stoliczkanus. Of these 
I collected P. hardwicket and P. jacquemonti, both as high as 
18,000 ft. on the southern ascent of the Donkia Pass, in close 
proximity to the Thibetan frontier. 

In drawing up the accompanying list illustrating the vertical 
distribution of the Himalayan Papilionide, I have been guided 
principally by my own personal experiences in the Sikkim 
Himalayas, but where such first-hand information was wanting 
I have supplemented it by making use of the data contained in 
the ‘ List of the Butterflies of Sikkim,’ by Lionel de Nicéville, 
already alluded to, as well as the admirable ‘‘ Catalogue of the 
Lepidoptera of Sikkim,” by Mr. H. J. Elwes, with the assistance 
of the late Otter Moller, published in the ‘ Transactions of the 
Entomological Society of London in 1888.’ My principal object 
in compiling the same is to elicit further information respecting 
the vertical range of species which are either very rare or un- 
represented in that part of the Himalayan chain which I visited, 
and must be considered as only of a preliminary character. 
The chief difficulty in the way of tabulating the vertical distri- 
bution of the Himalayan Lepidoptera consists in not being able 
to distinguish between those species which are truly indigenous 
to the various climatal zones—that is, performing their meta- 
morphoses there, as most of the commoner species occasionally 
occur in the winged state only for several thousand feet above 
the altitude at which they underwent their transformations, 
either through a spirit of adventure, or by being carried up 
involuntarily, in a measure, by warm ascending currents of air, 
as I have frequently seen them during exceptional spells of hot 
weather experienced during the progress of the south-west 
monsoon. What is absolutely necessary is to ascertain where 
the different species undergo their adolescent existence, and this 
was out of the question during a short stay of seven months in 
the districts under consideration. 

In the accompanying table the numbers in the columns 
correspond to the following climatal zones as defined by that 
great scientific traveller Baron Humboldt :— 


(1. Equatorial Zone ge .... Unrepresented.) 
2. Tropical Zone... Pe ... 200-2500 ft. 
3. Sub-Tropical Zone ees ... 2500-5000 ft.

7. Alpine or Arctic Zone. ... ... 12,500-15,000 ft. 
8. Snow or Polar Zone ... ... 15,000-17,500 ft. 


These figures must only be considered as approximately 
correct, as they vary greatly in different parts of the chain. In 
the interior of Sikkim, as well as in the North-west Himalayas, 
zones 2 to 6 are generally from 1000 to 8000 ft. lower, while in 
the latter part of the chain the alpine and snow zones rise con- 
siderably higher. 

The following abbreviations have been employed :— 

EK. Signifies that the species is only found, so far as is 
known, to the eastward of Nepaul: 388 species. 

W. That the species is confined to the west thereof: 
5 species. 

The number of species which range throughout the entire 
chain consisting of 19 species. 

While the total number recorded from the whole of the 
Himalayas is 57 species. 

* Denotes that the species is probably only an immigrant 
in the particular zone indicated, and does not perform its 
metamorphoses there. Including these occasional visitors, the 
number of species occurring in each climatal zone may be given 
approximately as under :—

In the South-eastern Himalayas, on the outer hills, zones 
Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 belong in preponderating degree to the Indo- 
Chinese province of the Indo-Malayan Region of zoogeographers, 
while in the interior thereof, zones Nos. 5 and 6 belong, in like 
measure, to the Manchurian province of the extensive Palearctic 
Region ; the latter, however, being considered, in the North-west 
Himalayas, as approximating more closely to the Mediterranean 
province of the same. ‘Throughout the entire chain, zones 
Nos. 7 and 8 belong exclusively to the Siberian province of the 
Palwarctic Region of Messrs. P. H. Sclater and A. R. Wallace. 

An analysis of the Himalayan Papilionide according to their 
zoogeographical affinities furnishes the following interesting 
results :— 

Belonging to the Indo-Chinese province of the Indo-Malayan 
Region: 38 species (of which 9 also occur in the Indo-Malayan 
province). 

Belonging to the Hindustani province of the Indo-Malayan 
Region: 2 species (of which 1 also occurs in the Cingalese province). 


204. THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Belonging in equal degree to the Hindustani and Indo-Chinese 
provinces: 10 species. 

Total for Indo-Malayan Region: 50 species. 

Belonging to the Manchurian and Mediterranean provinces 
of the Palearctic Region: 1 species. 

Belonging to the Siberian province of the Palearctic Region: 
6 species. 

Total for Palearctic Region : 7 species. 

But these statistics exclude the species of Indo-Malayan 
origin which also occur in the Palearctic Region in the Hima- 
layas, which, including immigrants, amounts to about ten, 
increasing the total of the family occurring in the Palearctic 
portion of the chain to seventeen. While, if we include all those 
species which frequent the two temperate zones on the outer 
hills, which belong climatically, although not zoologically, to 
the Palearctic Region, the number of tropical and temperate 
modifications of tropical forms belonging to the Indo-Malayan 
Region would be represented by the substantial total of twenty- 
eight, some eighteen being indigenous thereto, the remaining 
ten being only casual visitors. This affords an interesting 
comparison to that which is the case in-the preponderatingly 
Palearctic province of Northern China and Japan, where in 
corresponding climatal zones, though considerably further north, 
a somewhat similar intermingling of tropical and temperate 
forms takes place. Here, however, though the Indo-tropical 
element in the Rhopalocera fauna is probably equally in evidence 
as regards the number of individuals is concerned, the number 
of temperate Palearctic species is considerably in excess. This, 
however, does not apply to the Papilionide, in which family, 
strange to say, the tropical element is most numerous in species, 
consisting, in fact, of seventeen to only five of a Palearctic 
temperate character, according to Mr. H. J. Elwes in his 
interesting paper ‘‘ On the Butterflies of Amurland, North China, 
and Japan,” published in the ‘ Proceedings of the Zoological 
Society of London for 1881,’ in which are given the names of as 
many as ten Himalayan species (including Papilio machaon), 
which are also found there. 

It was no doubt the fact of the Indo-tropical facies being so 
pronounced that induced the late Dr. Staudinger to regard North 
China and Japan as an integral part of the Indo-Malay Region, 
although I personally fully concur with my venerable friend Dr. 
Alfred Russel Wallace in considering that they should be re- 
tained in the Palearctic Region, to the Manchurian province of 
which they properly belong. 

I will conclude by stating that the number of Himalayan 
Papilionide which range southwards to the equatorial districts 
of the Malay Peninsula, the Malay Archipelago, the Deccan, 
and Ceylon (including representative forms and geographical 
varieties) consists of at least twenty species.

lum; down the middle of the latter is a fine keel. The base of the 
metapleure is smooth, the base and apex of this part with a crenu- 
lated border. Palpi pale testaceous. There is a smooth, shining, 
triangular space on the sides of the metanotum at the base. The 
front is raised and transverse above the antenne. The furrow 
separating the scutellums is narrow and moderately deep.

ON TWO NEW GENERA (ONE REPRESENTING A 
NEW TRIBE) FROM BORNEO. 


By P. Cameron. 


KUTANYCORMUS, gen. nov. 


$. Antenne probably thirteen-jointed, the last (probably two 
closely amalgamated) thicker than the others, closely shortly pilose, 
the other joints of the flagellum fringed with longish stiff hair ; they 
are placed shortly above the middle of the face. Eyes oval, malar 
space almost two-thirds of their length. Clypeus small, separated 
from the face by a wide semicircular depression. Pronotum twice 
the length of the mesonotum, not quite twice longer than wide, 
roundly narrowed in front. Mesonotum wider than long; parapsidal 
furrows distinct, running from the outer basal edge obliquely to the 
scutellum, from the base of which deep curved furrows run to the 
tegulz ; it is large, flat. Metanotum flat to the apex, which has a 
short steep slope; the lower part of the metapleurze with an oblique 
furrow, which becomes gradually widened towards the apex. Abdo- 
men flat, shorter than the thorax, the first segment almost sessile, as 
long .as the following two united. Legs moderately stout, the hind 
femora normal, not much longer than the hind cox. Stigmal branch 
large, thickened, longish ovoid; there is no post-marginal vein ; the 
margin nervure short compared with the submarginal, it being about 
one-third of its length ; from near the base of the apical third of the 
submarginal a stout nervure runs obliquely to the posterior part of the 
wing. The hind wings have nervures as in the anterior, except that 
there is no stigmal branch. The head and thorax are more or less 
striated; the mandibles apparently edentate, the apex broad, oblique. 
Ocelli in a curve. Head seen from the front longer than wide. The 
abdominal sutures are transverse. 

The female has the antenne short, stout, the third joint distinctly 
longer than the fourth, the flagellum densely pilose; its apex does 
not reach to the tegulea when turned back. There is a long, thin

ovipositor, longer than the body. There is a transverse furrow 
at the base of the scutellum, from either side of which a shorter 
oblique one runs along the sides. As in the male, I can detect 
no proper teeth on the mandibles; the apex of the latter has a furrow 
in the middle. . 


Belongs to the Torymine, in which it will form a new tribe 
sufficiently characterized by the densely pilose antenne, and, 
more particularly, by the presence of the oblique nervure issuing 
from the submarginal. The latter is a feature which I cannot 
find in any Chalcid in my collection, nor can I find any genus 
described with such an.additional nervure. 


Hutanycormus pilicornis, sp. n. 

Black, smooth, and shining, sparsely covered with longish black 
hair ; the antennal scape and legs rufo-testaceous, the mandibles and 
oral region of a slightly darker rufo-testaceous colour ; wings hyaline, 
the nervures blackish, the stigmal spot longish oval. ?, Length, 
5mm.; ovipositor, 8 mm. 


Kuching, Borneo (John Hewitt, B.A.). 


Metanotum, except the outer edges, transversely rugose ; a curved 
crenulated furrow in the centre of the smooth outer part. Meta- 
pleurze smooth above, the lower part striated at the base, the rest 
coarsely aciculated, the middle broadly depressed. There is a wide 
depression on the apex of the mesopleure, formed by the apex of the 
latter being depressed, and by the base of the metapleuree being 
raised; the depression does not reach to the top of the pleure, and 
is narrowed above; it is finely, closely, longitudinally striated ; the 
part above it is less closely striated. The collar is about one-half 
longer than wide, and is roundly narrowed at the base. 


CLEONYMIN#. 
TaoGa, gen. nov. 


Antenne thirteen-jointed, the scape not reaching to the ocelli. 
Hyes hairy, large, oval, the malar space as long as them. Parapsidal 
furrows narrow but distinct. Scutellum large, its apex broadly 
rounded. Metanotum short, its apex transverse above; it has a steep 
vertical slope. Abdomen sessile, its base transverse, fitting close to 
the metanotum; the second segment fully one-half the length of the 
first, the third as long as them both united; its apical half has a 
central keel, which is prolonged along the back of the basal segment 
of the ovipositor; the latter is keeled along the sides; it is as long 
as the basal part of the abdomen; the following segment is half its 
length ; both are densely pilose. The apical segments are apparently 
absent. Marginal branch half the length of the submarginal ; the 
stigmal short, thick, dilated at the apex; the post-marginal branch 
short. Legs normal; the tarsi five-jointed, the spurs short; there 
are two on middle tibizw ; the claws short and slender. The antennze 
issue from near the base of the clypeus, below the eyes; frontal de- 
pression wider below than the eye orbits; in the centre of the lower 
half is a wide keel, narrowed towards the top, where it is raised. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. Pay | 


Ocelli in a triangle. The abdominal segments are transverse. There 
is only one spur on the middle tibiz; it is small. Pronotum short. 
Labrum visible at the excised apex of clypeus. 


Is nearest to Wlemba, Cam., which may easily enough be 
separated from it by the eyes not being hairy, by the absence of 
parapsidal furrows, by the longer and thinner abdomen, of which 
the second segment is not as long as the first, and by the longer 
and thinner, more curved stigmal branch.

the coxee dark blue. Vertex black, tinged with blue, the occiput dark 
ereen, darker in the middle; the sides of front blue to near the 
bottom of the eyes; the lower part, face, and malar space emerald- 
green, as are also the outer orbits. The head is closely somewhat 
strongly reticulated, punctured, the vertex more finely than the rest. 
On the lower half of the antennal depression is a longish wedge- 
shaped keel, which becomes gradually narrowed from the bottom up- 
wards. Basal joints of palpi dark red; the palpi densely covered 
with white pubescence. The sides of the head, pleurze, and base of 
legs densely covered with longish white pubescence. Basal slope of 
pronotum emerald-green, bluer at the apex ; there is a narrow smooth 
line down the centre. Mesonotum, scutellum, and apical slope of 
metanotum purplish black; a bluish purple mark on either side of

the apex of scutellum, base of metanotum, apex of propleurz, base 
and apex of mesopleurz, and the metapleuree bluish purple, the rest 
of the pleure blackish purple. Abdomen purple ; the terebra black, 
the apices of the segments blue, smooth, and shining. Wings hyaline, 
iridescent, the stigma and nervures black ; a narrow streak along the 
costa. @. Length, 14 mm. 

Kuching, Borneo (John Hewitt, B.A.). 

Closely punctured, the thorax slightly more coarsely than the 
head, the abdomen more finely than either; the punctures on the 
pleure running into reticulations. Pleural tubercles large, smooth, ~

rows distinct. Malar space as long as the eyes, the middle furrowed. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


Lyc@NA coRYDON IN DrvonsHtrE.—Neither in the recent book, 
‘The Butterflies of the British Isles,’ nor in the late C. G. Barrett’s list 
in the ‘ Victoria History of Devon,’ do I see any mention of the occur- 
rence of Lycena corydonin Devonshire. It may therefore interest you 
to know that I caught a male specimen of this species on the Devon 
coast, about two miles west of Beer Head, on August 6th, 1908. I 
gave the specimen at the time to a friend who was with me, and he sub- 
sequently wrote to me that he took another example of L. corydon 
at the same spot, on August 17th, 1908. The particular sea-bank 


212 - HE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


is much favoured by butterflies, and Leucophasia sinapis, Adopea 
acteon, and Lycena adonis, together with other local species, can be 
taken in plenty at the proper seasons. I have also seen Zephyrus 
betule there.—(Rev.) F. L. Buatuwaytr; 1, Stonefield Avenue, 
Lincoln, July 12th, 1909. 


ExtTENDED Pupat PERIoDS IN THE GENUS EupitrHEcia.—Prof. 
Meldola’s experience with Hupithecia togata, recorded in the current 
‘ Entomologist,’ p. 182, is by no means unusual for that species and 
several others of the genus. The following occur to me as prone to 
go over two winters in pupa: H.. venosata and pulchellata (particu- 
larly Scottish), H. haworthiata (isogrammaria), fenestrata, expalle- 
data, and, I think, plwmbeolata. I have just had an interesting 
experience with H. cretaceata, the American variety or representative 
of fenestrata. From a number of larve collected in Vancouver 
Island in August, 1907, I bred fifteen moths between June 6th and 
July 8th, 1908; then no more emerged until yesterday (July 4th, 
1909), when five appeared with a rush, within three or four hours 
of one another. No doubt the cold weather of June is largely 
responsible, but the effect is rather curious. There are few, if any, 
still left to emerge. I ought to add that several other species which 
T have bred largely have invariably, in my experience, emerged after 
a single hibernation, e.g., H. castigata, absinthiata, denotata (cam- 
panulata), gasioneata, &amp;e.—Lovis B. Prout; 246, Richmond Road, 
N.H., July 5th, 1909. 


GYNANDROUS SATURNIA PAVONIA (CARPINI). — From a hundred 
healthy Denbighshire cocoons of this species—only fifteen per cent. 
of which yielded imagos, the rest are lying over—I got a fine female, 
in May, ornamented with male antenne. In all other characters the 
appearance of the moth is feminine.—J. ARKLE; Chester. 


ENICMUS MINUTUS, Linn., ATTACKING CryPToCcoccUS FAGI, Bar.— 
During June, 1908, I noticed this beetle repeatedly among a strong 
colony of the Coccid upon the bark of a large beech-tree in my garden 
here. Upon one or two occasions, by the aid of a lens, I actually 
witnessed H. minutus masticating Coccids. This was called to my 
mind by to-day again noticing several individuals in the same posi- 
tion, but now both insects are much scarcer than at the corresponding 
period last year: I could discover but half a dozen beetles where 
there then were as many hundreds. The Coccid, too, is much sparser, 
which circumstance is doubtless due to the ravages wrought among 
it by the clavicorn in 1908. Among the Hnicmus and Cryptococcus 
to-day I saw a couple of specimens of the rare Hemipteron, Mzcro- 
physa pselaphiformis, Curt., which is suggestively stated to occur 
‘‘on lichen-covered trees’’; it was some time before I could satisfy 
myself that the bark was whitened by a Coccid and not lichen.— 
CuaupE Morurey; Monk Soham House, Suffolk, July 4th, 1909. 


Curious SexuaL Conpuct or Weervints.—On Saturday last 
(June 19th) I was surprised to find on a low bush two green weevils 
(presumably of the Polydrosus family, but the precise species I know 
not) apparently 2 cop. with two females of a much larger species, 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 913 


which I identify as Polydrosus micans. My first impression of a 
startling difference between the male and female of mzcans was 
momentary only, but the possibility of a hybrid between two such 
dissimilar species appeared to warrant further investigation, and the 
two pairs were accordingly placed in separate glass-tubes and taken 
home. On my arrival home I found that one pair had separated, and 
the male had apparently lost all interest in his companion; but in 
the other tube attempts at copulation continued from 7.30 to 
11.30 p.m. uninterruptedly, but at the end of that time I shook the 
tube up, which separated the insects, and no further attempts were 
apparently made. In the morning the two were at different ends of 
the tube, each apparently ignoring the presence of the other. I am 
satisfied from a careful examination through a strong lens whilst the 
attempts were being made that copulation did not actually occur. 
The male organ was for the greater part of its length too inflexible to 
allow of the penetration of the female organ of the different species, 
the angle was not right. Save for this, the violent and repeated 
efforts of the male could only have ended one way. If two insects 
sexually ripe but of different species are isolated together, the 
abnormal may occur, but it did strike me as very strange that 
attempts of this sort should be made right out in the open, where 
one would have thought the females of the green Polydrosus would 
have far out-numbered the females of micans.—C. G. Doventy; 
27, South Molton Street, W., and Eghams Farm, Beaconsfield, 
June 22nd, 1909. 

[It is frequently noticed that Coleoptera of two distinct species 
are in the position of copula without copulation subsequently oc- 
curring.—D. 8.] 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


ABUNDANCE OF PIERIS BRAssIc#.—During the last three weeks 
of May Pieris brassice daily increased in numbers until the end of 
the month, when in this part of south-east Essex a perfect swarm 
occurred, but nearly all that I observed were males, it was only 
during the last few days of May that the females appeared in any 
number; until then I had not seen half a dozen, while the males 
were flying in hundreds. Pieris rape was equally prolific, but the 
sexes of more equal proportion.—F. W. Fronawxk; July, 1909. 


PROPORTIONATE NuMBER OF SEXES OF THANAOS TAGES.—Although 
the males of most or all species of butterflies appear on the wing 
some days before the females, I think the following note is worthy of 
record, considering the date of observation and the fact that I noticed 
the species flying over the same spot six days previously. On May 
21st last I captured forty-five Z'. tages over a small patch of rough 
ground about fifty yards long by ten yards wide; out of this com- 
paratively large number only one was a female, which deposited a 
quantity of eggs. Last year, on the evening of June 10th, in the 
corner of an adjoining field, I found this butterfly in such abundance 
at rest on the heads of grasses that in some instances there were as 


914 THE ENTOMOLOGIST, 


many as five resting together on the same grass-head; on ‘this 
occasion both sexes were-about equal in number.—F. W. Frouawk ; 
July, 1909. J 


ACRONYCTA ACERIS LARVA) FEEDING ON Prum.—In August last 
year I found four small larve of A. aceris feeding on the foliage 
of a plum-tree in the garden here. They were transferred to a 
breeding-cage and supplied with twigs from the plum. Pupation 
occurred in due course, and two male specimens emerged in late 
June of the present year. These are perhaps rather small, but they 
are certainly not less in size than some examples I have reared in 
former years from larvee that had fed on sycamore.—RicHARD SOUTH ; 
96, Drakefield Road, Upper Tooting, S.W. 


CIDARIA MIATA EMERGING IN JuLy.—A small batch of the ova of 
this species were received from Burniston, Yorkshire, on April 25th 
last. Larvae from these hatched out April 29th, fed well on sallow, 
and by June 26th all had pupated. A male specimen emerged on 
July dth, followed by another the next day, and two examples of the 
same sex on the 8th of the month. Between July 11th and 20th 
two other males and seven females appeared.—RicHarD SouTH. 


Insects 1n Siciny.—With the Editor’s permission I should like 
to thank my numerous entomological friends for their sympathy with 
me in the sorrowful time of the earthquake at Messina, which 
terrible event put a-stop for some months to pleasant entomological 
excursions in the country. ‘The first months of the year proved 
exceptionally wet, and as I had lost all my entomological apparatus, 
it was Haster (April) before I could resume collecting. I was then 
domiciled at Catania, and my first excursion was to the back of 
Mount Htna, stopping at several towns on the return journey from 
. the medieval town of Randazzo. A most interesting place for lovers 
of the antique—not to say ignorant and backward. Situated 3000 
or 4000 ft. above the sea-level, the climate somewhat resembles that 
of England, and warm clothing was a necessity. Mount Etna rises 
over 10,000 ft., with snow on the upper half, while the nearest moun- 
tain to the west is less than 5000 ft., and is sown with corn to the 
summit. Amongst the boulders separating the cornfields we found a 
“tiger ’”’ caterpillar crawling about on the short grass, &amp;c., very much 
resembling that of A. fuleginosa, but with black bands. I collected a 
dozen out of hundreds, and to my surprise I bred what I call the 
“black burnet”’ moth—Syntomis phegea. This insect seems generally 
distributed in Sicily; the first specimens I came across were in the 
plain of Catania, in May, almost on the sea level, and subsequently 
I found it plentifully at Taormina and also at Messina, where it can 
be picked off the flowers readily by its antennew, being one of the 
most obtrusive of the Lepidoptera. The female readily deposits its 
eggs loosely in a pill-box, and when I reached England on the 16th 
of June I found that a batch of eggs laid the week before had just 
hatched. The young caterpillars resemble those of Arctia villica (the 
cream-spot tiger moth), and (imitation being the sincerest form of 
flattery) I have, in my small way, imitated the entomologists who 
are trying to re-introduce Chrysophanus dispar, whom I wish success, 


SOCIETIES. 915 


so yesterday I chose what I considered a good locality near London, 
and sowed the youthful phegea larve amongst scattered plants of 
dandelion, a food they apparently approved of in confinement. 
Should any collector meet with the species in 1910, please communi- 
cate with me, and do not exterminate it. 

Crossing the lava beds on Mount Etna between Bronté and 
Aderno, the “ orange-tip”’ was flying amongst the spurge, almost the 
only plant which grows there, but which flowers almost as brightly 
as broom, quite different to our English spurge. The orange-tips 
seemed also to be far brighter than our English species, but my 
net was packed away, and I postponed capturing the specimens 
until a future early visit which never took place. At Aderno I had 
my net and captured my first Papilio podalirius, the loveliest flier 
amongst butterflies that I have come across. It does not fly, it 
simply “soars” in the air. This may be an Irish bull, but it is true. 
Close to Catania a “procession” caterpillar on the pine-trees was 
very common whenever the pine-trees occurred. Occasionally some 
caterpillars would be blown down from the large nests on the tops of 
the trees, and instinctively they formed a line, head to tail, and 
marched off to regain their food-plant. It was curious to watch a 
line, over a yard long, crossing the dusty roadway in perfect order. 
I kept some larve, which spun up, but have not yet produced moths, 
so I am not sure of the species. 

Towards the end of May I returned to Messina and resumed my 
walks up the adjoining mountains. Hach day I was able to get three 
or four fresh species of butterflies, mainly those we get in England, 
or reputed British species. I found it difficult to get an entire 
novelty. I own up that I was quite overwhelmed with delight when 
I got my first and only Argynnis pandora; the lovely under side 
is indescribable. Charaxes jastus (one only) does not soar like P. 
podalirius, but flies hurriedly. M. didyma makes a brilliant show 
when innumbers. Our own P. machaon frequents the hills, and has 
a curious habit of settling on a culm of long grass, and floating with 
open wings from side to side like an inverted pendulum. 

As I had no means of setting my specimens, I put them in 
papers, with data. Later on I hope to set them, and shall then be 
able to make a complete list of my captures. Speaking generally 
regarding the butterflies of Sicily, it seems to me that Sicily would 
make a good appanage to Great Britain, and I am surprised to find 
that twenty degrees of latitude make so little difference—J. Pharr 
Barrett ; 30, Endwell Road, Brockley, S.E., July 10th, 1909.

CLINODIPLOSIS EQUESTRIS (Waaner); AN INSECT 
NEW TO GREAT BRITAIN. 
By Frep Enock, F.L.S. 


Ir is with feelings of anything but pleasure that I record the 
appearance of this wheat ‘‘ pest’? in Great Britain. On August 
18th, 1908, Mr. George E. Mainland, F.R.M.S., of Tenby, sent 


Wheat-stalk, showing larve in situ, and damage between each joint and to the ear. 


to me a box of wheat-stalks taken from a field in that neigh- 
bourhood. Between each joint, underneath the leaf-sheath, were 
from cix to nine apodous larve of a bright red colour, resting in 
a curled position, each in a cavity in the stalk three-sixteenths 


ENTOM.—SEPTEMBER, 1909. i 


218 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


of an inch long, with a growth at the head and bottom, much 
resembling (in miniature) a niche in the wall of a cathedral. 
The larve were actively twisting about, evidently full-grown, for 
in a few days they left the stalks and buried themselves in the 
light soil from the field. 

Specimens were sent (by the owner of the field) to the Board 
of Agriculture and Fisheries for name and information how to 
treat the pest which had attacked the wheat and barley. The 
advisers of the Board informed the owner that ‘‘ the wheat was 
suffering from an attack of the Hessian Fly!” 

As I had worked out the life-history of this destructive insect, 
I felt fully justified in flatly contradicting this statement, and 
some months after, when all the larve had buried themselves 
and so got beyond control, the advisers then informed the owner 
that the larve were those of Diplosis aurantiaca, ‘(a dangerous 
wheat pest”; but, so far as I can ascertain, this was about all 
that was done by the Board of Agriculture. 

I sent a photograph of the injured stalks to Dr. L. Howard, 
the United States Entomologist and Head of the Bureau of Ento- 
mology, Board of Agriculture; but he was glad to say that 
nothing of the kind had been seen in America, and that it was 
quite new to him. 

I kept my larve in the soil until June of this year, when I 
found several in very much the same condition as when I last 
saw them. I asked Mr. Mainland to send me a good supply, 
which he did on June 12th. Some of these I observed change to 
pup, which very much resembled the larve in colour. Previous 
to pupating, the larve, by twisting and twirling, managed to 
bury themselves and scoop out a small oval chamber, in which 
they changed to pup. Some of these I ruptured in digging up, 
but in others observed the larval skin cast and the pupa evolved. 
At first the legs were difficult to discern, as they scarcely pro- 
jected beyond the body. In the course of a week the wings and 
eyes began to darken, and the leg-sheaths were more distinct ; 
the abdomen, too, and the dark dorsal marks became visible, 
until, just a month after pupating, I bred six of the female flies. 
These, together with my original photograph of the injured 
stalks, I forwarded to Mr. C. O. Waterhouse, who placed them in 
the hands of Mr. E. E. Austen, the Dipterist at the Natural 
History Museum, who very kindly searched out the true name— 
viz. Clinodiplosis equestris (of Wagner)—whose figure of the 
injured stalk agreed in every respect with my photograph. It 
appears that Wagner obtained his first specimens in 1865 and 
1866 from Fulga, Cassel, Germany, but it has not been much 
heard of since that time. 

Being anxious to learn all I could of this extraordinary 
“pest,” I determined to visit the infected field near Tenby. On 
June 23rd Mr. and Miss Mainland visited the field, and observed 


THE LARGE ‘‘ COPPER.” 219 


a vast number of midge-like flies swarming in the ridges (the 
field having been ploughed and potatoes were then growing). A 
high wind was blowing, making capture of the flies a very 
difficult matter ; however, a male and two females were caught, 
and sent on to me. I recognized the similarity of colour on the 
abdomen of the female, but could not then say positively that 
these flies had emerged from the red pupe, though I thought 
they had. Nothing more was seen of this great multitude 
of flies. 

On July 9th I went down to Tenby, where, by the kind hospi- 
tality and guidance of Mr. Mainland, as well as the courtesy and 
assistance of Mr. Cole, upon whose field this pest appeared, 1 
obtained a supply of the larve and pupe by simply using my 
fingers to dig them up, their red colour making them very con- 
spicuous objects in the bright sunlight. I also swept a number 
of female flies from the rank herbage around the field. These, 
as well as the three caught by Mr. Mainland, were identical with 
those I bred. 

Up to the time of writing (Aug. 11th) nothing has been heard 
of its re-appearance, about which the Board of Agriculture, with 
its long list of ‘‘inspectors,”’ appears not to have taken any more 
serious interest than when first informed of its presence in the 
wheat-stalks. The only time when it could and ought to have 
been burned in the field, the wheat was left to rot, and the larve 
were allowed to enter the earth and there remain to complete 
their transformations. 

If human ‘‘Boards” are idle, insects are not, and by this 
neglect and ignorance there is now present with us (in ambush, 
maybe) a vast army of devastating insects which may yet make 
their presence felt; for, unlike the Hessian Fly, the Tenby pest 
can and has successfully passed through a very trying English 
winter. 


THE LARGE “COPPER,” ITS HABITS, AND ONE OF 
ITS PRESENT. HAUNTS. 


By W. G. SuHeupon, F.E.S. 


I suppose there is no butterfly that has a greater attraction 
for the average British lepidopterist than our long lost glory, 
Chrysophanus dispar, and this species was one of the reasons 
that turned my steps towards the Danube this summer. 

On the morning of June Ist last, at the early hour of eight 
o’clock, I walked out of the little wayside station of Kamaraerdo, 
some few miles south-west of Budapest, where I had been most 
kindly conducted by Professor Schmidt to see C. dispar alive. 
The country was very different in character to that frequented 

T 2 


220 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


by it in Britain, years ago, probably largely in consequence of 
the partial cultivation of its haunts. A valley some half-mile 
in width, the sides gently undulating up one or two hundred 
feet to its vine-clad crest on one side, and to the locally famous 
Budapest national playground, the Kammerwald, on the other. 
Except for a narrow strip at the bottom of varying width, the 
slopes were taken up by cultivation, and produced, in addition to 
grapes, luxuriant crops of wheat, barley, rye, sainfoin, potatoes, 
and maize; the remaining uncultivated portion being the 
present stronghold of C. dispar. Centuries ago this had been no 
doubt a quaking, undrained, reedy bog, where the food-plant flour- 
ished luxuriantly and the outflow from which found its way to 
the mighty Danube close by. Modern improvements had 
changed all this; down the centre ran a ditch, willow-planted, 
which had drained the water off, and into this ditch emptied at 
intervals smaller channels, each one of which played its part in 
the general scheme. ‘This drainage system had converted the 
surface, leaving it moist indeed, but firm and covered with 
a thick crop of coarse grass, intermixed with flowering plants, 
amidst which the great waterdock grew abundantly in places. 
The sun shone brightly that June morning, and we had not 
got ten yards from the railway station, when slowly flying along 
the grassy side of a ditch I saw my first large ‘‘ copper”’ in the 
flesh, var. rutilus of course, but a very different object to the 
rather puny butterfly one usually gets from a dealer if a speci- 
men is purchased; for, next to our own peerless type, the Buda- 
pest is certainly one of the finest, if not the very finest, form to 
be found anywhere. My largest male and female expand 
respectively 44 mm. and 45 mm., as against the 46 mm. and 
49 mm. expanse of my largest British specimens. 
There is no mistaking C. var. rutilus on the wing for any 
other European butterfly ; the unique coloration identifies it at 
once. It has very similar habits of flight to the other Huropean 
species of the genus, the males usually flying briskly but not 
fast over the long grass, with a jerky movement common to most 
of the Lycenide, searching for the females; if another male is 
approached, either flying or settled on the grass, the two will 
rise in the air and fight together for a few moments, then 
separate and each pursue its way. It does not seem to be partial 
to resting on, or sucking at, the numerous flowers that grow 
in its haunts. I saw two or three specimens at rest on one 
flower or other, but these were quite the exception; it is very 
fond of, especially during the afternoon, settling on a grass 
stem, and opening its wings to their full extent to enjoy the 
sratifying warmth of the sun’s rays. It is then a magnificent 
object, brilliant beyond one’s power of imagination, a patch of 
living, sparkling, ruddy gold; but even a study of the brilliant 
upper side does not reveal all the glory of C. dispar. If you see 


FOOD-PLANT OF LYCENA (LATIORINA) ORBITULUS. 221 


a male approaching, flying slowly towards you over the long grass, 
do not be in a hurry to effect a capture, but watch, and as 
it passes you will see the sparkling gem-like, red gold, upper 
side, mingle with the delicate blue-grey under side, and form a 
natural kaleidoscope, a dream of colour well-nigh incomparable. 
Certain other species of Kuropean ‘‘ coppers” are brilliant and 
most beautiful, but there is something indescribable about C. dis- 
par that, to my mind, places it in a class by itself for beauty. 

The female is, of course, not so brilliant an object. She is 
generally to be found in some corner away from the usual haunts 
of the male, presumably after impregnation: one frequently 
observes her at rest during the morning, or she may be disturbed 
out of the herbage. During the afternoon she is usually seen flying 
slowly and steadily over the grass in search of the food-plant. 

One gets the impression that C. var. rutilus is only here for 
a time, for the whole of the herbage is cut for forage every 
season when the young larve of the first brood are feeding, and 
it is difficult to understand how any large proportion can reach 
maturity. Some of the examples I captured were very small, 
one expanding only 28 mm., evidently the result of insufficient 
nutrition. 

The melodious fluting of the golden oriole, and the unmis- 
takable ‘‘ Hoo, hoo, hoo,’’ of the hoopoe, two of our rarest and 
most beautiful birds, now alas, like the large ‘‘ copper,” extinct 
with us, or visiting us only ec isually, added greatly to the interest 
and charm of a red-letter day in one’s entomological life.

THE FOOD-PLANT OF LYC4iNA (LATIORINA) 
ORBITULUS. 


By T. A. Coapman, M.D. 


Wuen | made the observations recorded in the ‘ Kntomo- 
logist’ for last May on this subject, I felt much doubt as to 
whether Androsace vitaliana was the food-plant of L. orbitulus. 
Although it was unquestionably the food-plant at Binn, it might 
be, after all, only a food-plant, one amongst others. This doubt 
was based on the fact that my memories of the various places in 
which I had met with orbitulus were unaccompanied, as a rule, 
with any recollection of Androsace vitaliana. This plant is,how- 
ever, very inconsvicuous, except when in flower, and as orbitulus 
flies after the flowering is over, it seemed quite possible that the 
A. vitaliana was really the food-plant. 

Memory is not very trustworthy on a negative point like 
this, so that my doubts were not clear enough to justify me in 
expressing them when I wrote out the notes referred to. I, 


229, THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


however, determined to investigate the point on the first oppor- 
tunity. This opportunity arrived this summer, when I observed 
L. orbitulus at several Swiss stations, and at Arolla met with it 
in sufficient numbers to enable me to follow the matter up. In 
none of these localities could I find any Androsace vitaliana; it 
was therefore evident that the food-plant of the butterfly in 
these localities must be some other species. The butterflies 
were not plentiful or the weather favourable enough to make the 
investigation an easy one, and I had to spend a whole day and 
portions of several others before I could satisfy myself as to the 
correct solution. In fact, I did not succeed in seeing one 
specimen lay an egg, but I found the females of orbitulus were 
always attracted to, and paid special attention to, one plant, 
and on one occasion, and perhaps on a second, an egg appeared 
about to be laid, but actually it was not done. The plant proved 
to be Soldanella alpina. Butterflies in captivity laid freely on 
this, and the young larve now hatched eat it readily. 

It is no doubt a fact well known to botanists, but to me it 
was quite a discovery to find that Soldanella alpina was an 
abundant plant over large tracts of the alpine pastures between 
6000 and 8000 ft., forming quite an appreciable portion of the 
herbage. The ordinary tourist, from whom botanically the 
average entomologist can hardly be differentiated, looks on 
Soldanella as only occurring at very high elevations (8000 to 
9000 ft.), and near to snow, and then rather sparingly. This is 
true, however, only of plants in flower in high summer, say 
July ; I must confess to having had some such ideas. 

The plents at lower elevations must flower very early. Not 
only the flowers, but also the fruits (if any), had disappeared in 
the haunts of orbitulus at the end of July. . 

Soldanella alpina is therefore the food-plant of L. orbitulus 
at many, if not a majority, of its habitats. On the Soldanella, 
as on the Androsace, the larva lives on the leaves and not on 
the flowers ; though assuming, as seems probable, that it hyber- 
nates half-grown and feeds up in the spring, it may at that time 
attack the young inflorescence. 

Unfortunately both my plants and larve have suffered by 
the unavoidable ill-usage of travel, and I much doubt if my 
material will enable me to carry the life-history further than I 
did last year. 

Soldanella, like Androsace, belongs to the Primulacee, so that 
it seems very probable that ZL. orbitulus may also feed on some 
other plants of that order, Androsaces or alpine Auriculas. 
Both plants have thick fleshy leaves, and the larva bores into 
these and scoops out the parenchyma through a small hole, 
much as a Coleophora would do, or as the flower-buds are treated 
by the young larve of argiolus, betica, and other flower-eating 
Lycenids.

ABERRATIONS OF VANESSA URTICA. anv V. IO. 
By T. Revss. 


Fig. 1.—V. urtice ab. luna, n.ab. Fig. 2.—V. io, ab. 


I wouup like to record that on the 26th of July I bred a 
variety of V. urtice L. (Fig. 1), which showed the following 
varietal characters :— 

Upper side: on the fore wings there are only three blue lunules 
in the median part of the black marginal band, the four apical and the 
two lunules of the inner angle being replaced by black. The yellow 
spot between the second and third costal blotches is crossed with black. 
Hind wings: again in the black marginal band the four “n the right 
wing three) blue lunules of the costal and median part are either very 
faint or have entirely disappeared. The first two lunules of the four 
in the anal angle coalesce and form a large conspicuous blue crescent ; 
the other two lunules are normally developed. The dark orange belt 
is narrowed and clouded with black in the costal part. Under side: 
slightly darker than normal; the crescent on the hind wings is 
conspicuously marked. The parts of the facies not mentioned are 
normal. 

It is of interest to note the development of the blue lunules in 
this variety as compared with other forms in which reversely the 
costal (apical) lunules are favoured at cost of the anal lunules 
(to-formity, see ‘ Ent. Record,’ pt. 4, 1909, plate vii). 

On the 8th of August I bred a variety of V.io from wild 
Hertfordshire larve, in which the ocellus of the hind wings is dis- 
integrated into three distinct bright blue lunules (Fig. 2). On the 
right hind wing a fourth blue spot is marked (as also in many 
otherwise normal specimens of io), and the place of .a fifth spot 
is indicated—thus the possibility of a chain of lunules like in 
V. urtice is suggested. The normally yellow parts of the fore 
Wings are narrowed and grey in colour; the whole breadth of 


22.4 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


the ocellus is suffused with bright metallic blue-violet ; under 
side of hind wings suffused with yellow scales along the veins 
below the discal cell in the same manner as can be seen in 
many aberrations of wrtice. 


Spilosoma menthastri, ab. 


Tats unique aberration of Spilosoma menthastri was taken by 
Mr. Brown (one of the gamekeepers of my brother-in-law, Frank 
Percy, Esq.) on Ranworth Broad, Burlingham Hall, Norwich, on 
June 21st, 1909, and sent to me. 


Jos. F. Green. 
West Lodge, Blackheath. 


[In the figure of this remarkable specimen it will be noted 
that, although typical on the right side, aberration in the 
direction of ab. walkeri, Curtis, is strongly exhibited on the left 
fore wing.—R. §.! 


Zygana trifolii, ab. 


Tue above exceedingly curious insect was reared during the 
past summer by Mr. Sydney Thorne, of Bournemouth. As 
regards the right side it is a typical Zygena trifolii, but on the 
left side all the markings are confluent, and thus forms the 
elongate blotch-like mark characteristic of the uncommon ab. 
minoides, Selys. 


DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE NEW SPECIES OF CETONIIDM. 225 


Among some specimens from Hsher, collected in 1900, in my 
collection, is a female that, so far as concerns the right fore 
wing, is typical. On the left fore wing, however, spots 3, 4, 5, 
are confluent, and there is a red dash from 3 almost effecting a 
junction with the united basal spots (1, 2). Two other speci- 
mens (males) from the same locality and taken in the same year 
may be mentioned as peculiar. Hach of these has a small red dot 
before spot 4, on the left fore wing; in all other respects these 
examples are typical.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE NEW SPECIES OF 
CETONIIDH FROM THE INDIAN EMPIRE. 


By Ouiver. E. Janson, F.E.S. 


Diceros gracilis, n. sp. 

Body elongate and narrowed behind, shining black, sides of the 
thorax with an ill-defined red marginal band more or less dilated be- 
hind; elytra with a large pale yellow central patch, pygidium and apical 
segment of the abdomen red. Head sparsely punctured at the base, 
a little impressed and obliquely striated on each side between the 
eyes; clypeus slightly dilated in front, rather coarsely punctured, the 
side margins raised, the apex slightly rounded and with the margin 
evenly reflexed. Thorax finely and sparsely punctured, a large trans- 
verse impression on each side at the base with coarse horseshoe 
form punctures. Scutellum with remote fine punctures or almost 
impunctate. HElytra with eight regular rows of horseshoe form 
punctures which do not extend to the apex, the sutural row strongest 
and the two outer rows indistinct in some specimens, the apical part 
strigose. Pygidium strongly transversely strigose. Under side and 
legs strigose and coarsely punctured ; mesosternal process very long 
and curved inwardly towards the apex; abdomen very deeply and 
broadly impressed in the male, convex and more strongly punctured 
in the female; anterior tibizw with a strong subapical marginal tooth 
in both sexes. Length, 124-134 mm. 

Tharrawaddy, Burma, and Maria Basti, Brit. Bhotan (coll. 
Janson). 

The small narrow form, punctured impressions on the thorax 
and strongly punctured elytra of this species readily distinguish 
it from D. cuvera, Newm., to which it is most nearly allied, and 
its simple unarmed clypeus at once separates it from D. childreni, 
Westw. The size of the yellow elytral patch varies a little, but 
is very similar to that in the latter species. 


Teniodera idolica, u. sp. 
Black, above dull with short grey pubescence, under side and legs 
shiny and with longer and denser pubescence. Above with ashy- 
grey markings disposed as follows: on the head two longitudinal 


226 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


bands; on the thorax a marginal band on each side from a little 
before the middle to the basal angles and a large Y-form central mark 
extending from the anterior angles to the tip of the basal lobe where 
it dilates into a large round spot; on the scutellum a central stripe 
dilated at the base; on the elytra two transverse spots at the sides 
and a broad sutural band, forked and following the margin of the 
scutellum to the base, dilated before and again behind the middle and 
continued along the apical margins; on the pygidium a very broad 
central band. The under side broadly marked with ashy-grey at the 
sides, the femora with marginal bands of the same colour. Head 
slightly shiny, densely and coarsely punctured, the clypeus dilated 
and strongly rounded in front, the apical margin reflexed and broadly 
and shallowly emarginate. Thorax rounded at the sides, broadest a 
little before the middle, the side and basal margins slightly raised 
and shiny, coarsely and closely punctured. Elytra with a distinct 
median carina and rather indistinct punctured strie. Pygidium 
closely but indistinctly punctured. Under side and legs coarsely 
punctured; mesosternal process short, obtuse, cariniform ; abdomen 
slightly flattened, but not grooved, in the centre; posterior tibiez 
very strongly produced, keeled, and with a tuft of long yellow hair on 
the inner side at the apex. Length, 14 mm. 

Maymao, Upper Burma (coll. Janson). 

Allied to 7’. zebrea, Fairm. (of which I have a co-type from 
the author), but smaller, the head more closely punctured, the 
clypeus broader, more rounded at the sides, and with the apical 
margin reflexed and less deeply notched, the thorax more nar- 
rowed behind, the elytra more truncate at the apex, the under 
side less closely punctured, the abdomen in the male not im- 
pressed, and the posterior tibie of a quite different form. The 
markings are somewhat similar but less extended, the marginal 
bands on the thorax are not directed inwardly behind, there is

not dilated at the base. ‘The name given is in reference to the 
idol-like figure of the markings on the elytra. 


Teniodera indica, n. sp. 

Black or piceous, above opaque with sparse short golden pube- 
scence and pale ochreous or yellowish markings disposed as follows : 
on the head two longitudinal bands; on the thorax an oblique vitta 
on each side and a large Y-form central mark; on the scutellum a 
broad stripe slightly dilated at the base; on the elytra a small spot 
above the shoulder, two transverse lateral spots, a small mark at the 
apex of the scutellum, an irregular transverse mark about the middle 
of the suture, and a large apical mark extending a short way along 
the suture, where it is more or less dilated; on the pygidium a 
central spot or vitta. Under side shining, with golden pubescence 
and broad pale ochreous bands at the sides. Head very coarsely 
punctured, a smooth longitudinal median carina at the base; clypeus 
dilated and rounded at the sides, shallowly emarginate at the apex. 
Thorax broadest before the middle, where it is distinctly broader than

very dense coarse punctuation, which becomes confluent and rugose 
towards the sides, the side margin behind the middle slightly raised 
and smooth. Hlytra strongly costate along the centre, depressed and 
striated near the suture, punctured at the base and sides, slightly 
rounded at the apex. Pygidium convex, coarsely strigose and rugose. 
Under side strigose and with coarse semicircular punctures on the 
abdomen; mesosternal process narrow and obtuse; anterior tibiw

Miyake (1) describes a new species from Japan of the 
Noctuid genus Latirostrum, and remarks, ‘‘ Baron Takachiho 
captured the moth in a forest on Mount Hikosan, one of the high- 
est mountains in Kiushiu. He says the moth was resting on a 
leaf of a certain tree, with its long palpi extended forwards so as 
to imitate a spine in a very perfect manner, and he supposes 
that when it settles on a branch of a tree it may pass unobserved 
even by keen eyes, showing us the significance of the long palpi 
of this species.” ‘The same author (2) revises the Japanese 
Arctiane, enumerating, with synonymy, thirty-two species, with 
a table of distribution ; six species are figured, the larve of nine 
briefly described, and the food-plants of several listed, no less 
than seven being harboured by mulberry. Three new species 
are described, the previously known forms haying apparently 
been described at length in Japanese in the extra-reports of the 
Imperial Agr. Sta. 22 (1906). 

Lovell (7) reviews the subject of colour-sense in insects with 
relation to flowers. His paper is not very amenable to summari- 
sation, but, briefly, his results confirm the usual generally adverse 
position to Plateau’s opinions. 

Japha (8) discusses the ‘ defiance-attitude’’ of Smerinthus 
ocellatus, with a coloured plate. Kosminsky (4) discusses the 
influence of external conditions on Lepidoptera. Blunk (5) 
deals with colour variation in Dytiscus. 

A new entomological periodical has appeared in California 
(11); the first number deals principally with Aphidide and 
Coccide. 

It is surprising not to have seen a review in the ‘ Entomo- 
logist’’ of Poulton’s collection of Essays on Evolution (12) ; 
these are partly reprints of papers read or delivered before vari- 
ous meetings, but also largely new, the greater part being 
directly or indirectly connected with entomology, the following 
especially: ‘‘ Thomas Henry Huxley and the theory of Natural 
Selection’ (pp. 1938-219); ‘‘Natural Selection the Cause of 
Mimetic Resemblance and Common Warning Colours ” (220-70) ; 
‘‘Mimicry and Natural Selection’’ (271-92); ‘The Place of 
Mimicry in Scheme of Defensive Coloration ” (293-382) ; with a

classification and index of the examples of mimicry quoted 
(883-479). One of the notable mechanical features in the text 
is the copious index of 85 pp. 

British lepidopterists will probably be interested in Neweomb’s 
detailed observations on the habits of a United States Chryso- 
phanus (18). Maxwell-Lefroy discusses at some length the 
Castor Silkworm, Attacus ricinit (which is probably the domesti- 
cated form of A. cynthia). The larvee differ from all other silk- 
producing Indian larve in that they do not feed on mulberry, 
but on castor leaves; the cocoon is not closed and is not reel-able 
in the same way as other kinds. On the other hand, the cocoons 
do not require to be killed to prevent the egress of the moth, as 
one end is closed only with converging loops of silk (14). 


ON TWO NEW GENERA AND SEVEN SPECIES OF 
CHALCIDIDH (EUCHARINA) FROM BORNEO. 


By P. Cameron. 


ANCYLOTROPUS, gen. nov. 


3. Antenne twelve-jointed, the joints elongated, pilose. Parap- 
sidal furrows distinct, complete. Scutellum large, triangular, the 
apex prolonged into a broad spine, two-thirds of the length of the 
basal part, keeled down the centre, the apex slightly incised. Thorax 
rugose. Abdominal petiole long, cylindrical, as long as the rest of 
the abdomen, flat above, the sides margined. The right mandible 
with four teeth, the basal not so distinct as the others; the outer 
tooth less, but dilated at the base. Abdomen projecting upwards. 
Stigmal branch short, thick. Face raised in the centre, the raised 
part narrowed into a keel below; the clypeus with a large fovea on 
either side above. The head is broader than it is long, and is a little 
wider than the thorax. 


In the table of Ashmead (Mem. Cairn. Mus. i. 269) this genus 
runs to near Psilogaster, which has the antenne eighteen jointed, 
and the apex of the scutellum is rounded. The form of the scutel- 
lum in Ancylotropus is pretty much as in Saccharissa, but that 
genus has the antenne eighteen-jointed. 


Ancylotropus cariniscutis, sp. nov. 


Head and dilated part of abdomen black, the thorax dark blackish 
blue, with coppery and violaceous tints, the antennal scape, pedicle, 
palpi, tegule, and legs, except the cox, yellowish testaceous, the 
flagellum of antennz dark testaceous at the base, the apical joints 
blackish ; wings hyaline, the nervures testaceous. ¢g. Length, 
4 mm. 


Kuching, Borneo (John Hewitt, B.A.). 


230 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Basal two joints of antenne bare, the rest densely covered with 
long fuscous pubescence. Face and clypeus smooth, the vertex and 
front longitudinally striated, the striae stout and clearly separated. 
Mesonotum and scutellum somewhat strongly reticulated, the scutellum 
more widely than the mesonotum ; the centre, and, less strongly, the 
sides of scutellar spine keeled, the space between the keels with a 
few transverse striz. Metanotum coarsely irregularly reticulated. 
Propleure coarsely reticulated, the mesopleure more finely obliquely 
reticulated ; the metapleure strongly regularly reticulated and densely 
covered with white pubescence. Sides of abdominal’ petiole with two 
or three stout longitudinal strie. The mesopleure less densely 
covered with white pubescence than the metapleuree. Wings shortly, 
closely ciliated. The metapleure are broadly rounded at the apex. 


ELTOLADA, gen. nov. 


Antenne eleven-jointed, simple in the male, the joints elongated, 
cylindrical, pilose ; longer than the body, in female not much longer 
than the head and thorax united, the basal joint elongated, as long as 
the following two united. One mandible edentate, the other with a 
long apical followed by two short teeth. Parapsidal furrows distinct. 
Scutellum large, almost semicircular, the apex prolonged into a pro- 
cess which is as wide as long at the base, followed by two roundly 
curved forks. Abdominal petiole as long as the thorax, and longer 
than the rest of the abdomen in both sexes, narrow, cylindrical, of 
equal width; the dilated apical part is turned upwards. Marginal 
and post-marginal vein thickened, the latter half the length of the 
former and narrowed towards the apex, stigmal vein short, sessile, as 
long as thick. 

The simple, non-flabellate antenne might ally this genus with 
Psilogaster, which, however, may easily be known from it by the 
scutellum not being bidentate. The simple antenne in the male 
separate it from Stibula and Schizaspidia ; from the latter it may 
further be known by the very much longer abdominal petiole, and 
by the thickened marginal and post-marginal nervures, and the 
very short, thick, stigmal vein. ; 


Hltolada trimaculata, sp. nov. 


Head blue, the mandibles and palpi yellowish testaceous, the 
basal three joints of the antennz and the apical two testaceous, the 
apical more rufous in tint than the basal. Thorax yellowish testa- 
ceous, a large blue and violaceous mark, almost semicircular, but 
longer than wide, on the basal half of the central lobe, a smaller 
oblique one, longer than wide, its base rounded, the apex straight and 
oblique onthe two lateral, a line on the apex, touching the scutellum, 
a small triangular mark on the apex of the scutellum. Length, 5mm. 

Kuching, Borneo; May (John Hewitt). 

Sides of the head, from the base of the ocelli to the middle of the 
front, longitudinally striated, the strive strong and clearly separated, 
the centre, immediately under the antenne, with three curved trans- 
verse strie. Malar space to near the bottom stoutly obliquely

are some striz between the ocelli. Thorax coarsely reticulated, the 
metanotum more widely than the rest. Mesopleuree smooth, with a 
broad band of stout longitudinal striz at the base. The reticulations 
on the metapleure are long and narrow, and, at the base, are in three 
rows, the basal having the reticulations longer than the others. There 
is a crenulated furrow, with stout raised edges, down the centre of 
the scutellum. The apical forks of the scutellum are straight, 
obliquely diverging, and are as long as the basal part. 


Eltolada leucopoda, sp. nov. 


Head and thorax blue, the blue on the mesonotum tinged with 
green and darker coloured, the blue on the pleure slightly tinged with 
violaceous, the scutellum black, tinged with green. Abdomen black, 
the ventral surface brown. Antenne testaceous, tinged slightly with 
rufous; the legs whitish yellow, the cox blackish to near the apex. 
Scutellum large, the basal part forming a semicircle; the basal part 
of the spine longer than the apical forks, which are roundly curved, 
and are for the greater part brownish. Wings hyaline, with a fuscous 
cloud, longer than wide and rounded at the apex, at the stigma, the 
apex is faintly clouded, the nervures black. g. Length, 4-5 mm.

longer than the rest of the abdomen. 


Schizaspidia ceruleiceps, sp. nov. 

Dark green, the head and the dilated part of the abdomen blue, 
the occiput green, the antennz and legs testaceous, the femora and 
hind tibize infuscated ; wings hyaline, the nervures testaceous. Scu- 
tellum larger, longer than it is wide at the base, narrowed towards 
the apex, which is not quite half the width of the base; the apical 
forks wide, curved, narrowed towards the apex, which reaches close 
to the base of the apical fourth of the abdomen; it is longitudinally 
reticulated, the transverse keels finer than the longitudinal, the 
reticulations on the apical forks finer and more irregular than on the 
basal part. Mandibles testaceous. ¢g. Length, 4:5 mm, 


Kuching, Borneo (John Hewitt, B.A.). 


Head smooth, the sides of vertex widely, weakly striated, the 
malar space finely, irregularly striated. Pro- and mesonotum trans-

which is longer on the metanotum. 


Hucharis leviceps, sp. nov. 

Dark blue, the dilated part of the abdomen almost black ; antennal 
scape yellowish testaceous, the flagellum densely pilose, fuscous, the

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


ABRAXAS GROSSULARIATA ab, LACTICOLOR IN WARWICKSHIRE.—AS 
the distribution of varieties in this county seems very little worked, 
it might be well to record that on July 23rd a specimen of A. grossw- 
lariata ab. lacticolor emerged in my breeding-cage. The specimen, 
which was unfortunately a cripple in one wing, differed from the 
example figured in ‘ South” in having the black markings on the 
costa and ‘fringe slightly less obsolete. The insect was bred from a 
larva found at Rugby, fed on hawthorn.—P. W. Wurritey; Brant- 
wood, Halifax. 


KUPITHECIA TOGATA GOING OVER TWO SEASONS IN Pupan STaGE.— 
I had a similar experience to that of Professor Meldola (antea, p. 182) 
with pup of HL. togata, obtained, I expect, from the same source. Out 
of twelve pupz, five emerged last year, and six in the early part of 
June, 1909. They were exceptionally fine specimens. I had con- 
cluded that the pupz were dried up, as they were exposed to strong 
sunlight, whenever this somewhat rare phenomenon took place.— 
G. Berrram Kersuays; West Wickham, Kent, July 27th, 1909. 


SPANISH CHESTNUT AS A F'ooD-PLANT OF THECLA QUERCUS.—On 
May 31st (Whit Monday) of the present year I found a larva of 
T. quercus on a stub of Spanish chestnut. The larva was about 
three-parts grown and fed up well, in due course turning into a 
pupa, whence emerged a fine female butterfly on July 21st. I have 
never heard of this tree as a food-plant of 7’. quwercws ; in fact, in my 
experience, very few larve seem to take a fancy to it.—GEOFFREY 
Meape-Watpo; 17, Douglas Mansions, Cromwell Road, 8. W. 


REARING CHRYSOPHANUS RUTILUS IN ENGLAND.—With reference 
to the note on Chrysophanus dispar in the ‘ Entomologist’ for July, 
the following experiment, conducted by Mr. Newnham (since dead, I 
believe) at Church Stretton, may be of interest. Mr. Newnham 
procured a large frame, and in this he grew the food-plant of 
C. dispar. He then placed within the frame some larve of C. rutilus ; 
the imagines resulting were allowed to breed in a moist atmosphere. 
At the end of two or three years, a form much nearer dispar than 


U 


aD 


Tor THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


rutilus resulted. Unfortunately a severe winter ended the experi- 
ment. JI can vouch for the truth of this statement, having had it 
described by Mr. Newnham, who showed me the series of specimens 
about the year 1898.—RaupnH Rynanps; Highfields, Bidston Road, 
Birkenhead, July 5th, 1909. 


PERONEA VARIEGANA AND ABERRATIONS IN DurHAmM.—In 1908, 
whilst staying at Bishop Auckland, in Durham, during early July, I 
found a few larvee of Peronea variegana between leaves of a pear- 
tree growing up the end wall of a house. Among the seven or eight 
moths reared therefrom, only more or less greyish specimens and one 
example of ab. asperana occurred. About the middle of July last I 
was able to visit the same town again, and on this occasion secured 
a nice lot of larve of the species from the pear-tree. The majority 
of these attained the winged state, the bulk of the specimens were of 
the blackish marked grey form known as cirrana, and it is curious 
to note that the first moth to emerge (Aug. 5th), as well as the last 
(Aug. 27th), are of this form. The typical form, and also. ab. 
asperana, are well represented, together with modifications of each 
of those forms and of the czrrana form. In addition there were 
seven beautiful white specimens of ab. albana, Westw., four of 
which emerged on August 12th, two others on the 15th of that 
month, and one on the 22nd. The original description of albana 
runs as follows :—‘‘ Measures 7 lines in expanse; fore wings silky 
white, with a few white tufts of elevated scales on the disc, the costal 
margin slightly brunneous, as well as the apical fringe; hind wings 
pale brown. Closely allied to P. treweriana, but that species has the 
costa destitute of the slender brunneous margin, and the disc has a 
few black scales scattered about near the tip.” (Westw. &amp; Humph. 
‘Brit. Moths,’ ii. 162 (1851).) 

I may mention that, although I refer my white specimens to 
albana, they differ from the type, which is in the National Collection, 
and from the above description, in having the costa of fore wings 
more distinctly marked with brownish; most of them are rather 
larger in expanse and the wings appear broader.—RicHARD SourH. 


THE PERPENDICULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAPILIONIDH IN THE 
Hrmatayas.—I shall be obliged if any readers of the ‘ Entomo- 
logist’ will supply further information respecting the approximate 
range of altitude of all Papilionides occurring in the North-western 
Himalayas, in order to fill up some of the gaps in the table on 
pp. 205-6. The following errata require correcting :—Page 197, line 
2, for twenty-five read seventy-five. Page 199, line 12, also page 205, 
line 8, for P. didoneus read P. aidoneus. Page 205, line 4, for 
Papilionidze read Papilionine; line 21, for A. polyctor read Sarbaria 
polyctor.—W. Harcourt-Baru; August 16th, 1909. 


EnromoLocicaAL Crus.—A meeting was held on July 5th, 1909, 
at the ‘Hand and Spear’ Hotel, Weybridge, Mr. G. T. Porritt in the 
chair. Other members present were Messrs. R. Adkin, Donisthorpe, 
Rowland-Brown, and Verrall. The additional guests were twelve in 


number, including two honorary members—Messrs. A. H. Jones and 
Sich.

CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


ORANGE VARIETY OF ZYGHNA FILIPENDULH.—From some three 
dozen cocoons of Z. filipendule collected at Merrow, Surrey, in 
July, a fine specimen of ab. aurantia, Tutt, emerged on August 8th, 
the spots and hind wings being bright orange, the rest of the wings 
metallic blue.—E. S. A. Baynes; 120, Warwick Street, S.W. 


SELIDOSEMA ERICETARIA IN ScoTtLaAnD.—In ‘The Moths of the 
British Isles,’ I see that the only Scotch record for this moth is the 
Isle of Arran (1882). I took two male examples at the beginning of 
this month, on the marshy ground among the hills behind Mallaig, 
Inverness-shire.—E. 8. A. Baynes. 


ANTITHESIA SALICELLA IN WARWICKSHIRE. — We have much 
pleasure in recording this somewhat local Tortricid moth for War- 
wickshire. We have taken it to-day (July 26th) beneath an old 
willow, on the River Avon, near Rugby. Last year we captured a 
single specimen (again on a willow) at Brandon, Warwick, on July 
24th. There is also a specimen in the Collection of the Rugby 
School Natural History Society, labelled ‘2nd Aug. ’98, N. V. 
Sidgwick.” It is evident, therefore, that the insect is not rare in 
this county, though hitherto, apparently, it has been unrecorded. 
Barrett gives no Midland locality for it except Cheshire; but he 
states that it occurs as far north as Yorkshire and Durham.—P. A. 
and D. A. J. Buxton; Chigwell, Essex. 


Suaarine A Farture.—lI visited Cambridgeshire from middle of 
June to first week in July, and my experience was that moths were 
entirely absent, owing no doubt to the prevailing cold and wet. 
Conyersing with a well-known collector at Bedford, his testimony 
coincided with my own experience. A general report would be 
interesting, so as to give an idea of other records.—H. Evurert ; 
Letchworth. 


ACENTROPUS NIvEUS. — When taking my usual constitutional 
along the Westcliff front last night, I noticed a small Acentropus 
miveus excitedly spinning around, on the ground, under one of the 
electric light standards. I stooped to box it, and found that the 
cause of all the fuss, excitement, and endless gyrations was the 
presence of a female, which sex I had not previously seen, alive or 
dead, in-this district—F. G. WuirtLe; 7, Marine Avenue, Southend, 
August 16th, 1909. 


ABUNDANCE OF NOLA CUCULLATELLA AND PERONEA VARIEGANA.— 
On July 20th, 1909, I walked through Richmond Park (Surrey) and 
noticed that Nola cucullatella, which is usually common there, was in 
greater abundance than in former years. The specimens were also 
of good size and nearly all in remarkably good condition. Every 
whitethorn of any size had several specimens at rest on the trunk or 
on the larger branches. I counted the moths on only one tree, and 
these amounted to ten. Among the Nolas were a few Gelechia 
vulgella, some Swammerdamia lutarea, and many worn Blastodacna 
hellerella (Laverna atra). Another common species which is attached

to whitethorn has also been, I think, more abundant this year than 
usual, or, one ought perhaps to say, is more abundant, as I believe 
Peronea (Acalla) variegana, the species I allude to, hybernates in the 
imago state. I have seen a great many sitting on whitethorn leaves 
in the hedges in Chiswick and Brentford. The parti-coloured and 
dark forms were equally common, but the browner variety was much 
scarcer.—ALFRED SICH. 


PrLusIA MONETA IN NortH LincoLnsHirE.—I took a fresh speci- 
men of Plusia moneta on July 18th, 1909, in a garden at Limber, in 
North Lincolnshire.—E. A. Cockayne; 16, Cambridge Square, W. 


CELASTRINA ARGIOLUS IN MippLEsEx, &amp;c.—In my previous note 
(antea, p. 186) I mentioned the fact that I had never seen an autumn 
example of this species here in all the years I have met with it 
common or otherwise in the spring. Yesterday (August 22nd), pre- 
paratory to a big shower, the sky was clear, and I noticed a female 
C. argiolus at rest on a flower-cluster of hydrangea; and a male 
flying rapidly over the lawn. With regard to the Pierids, reported 
by me as so common this year in Middlesex in May, and in Essex by 
Mr. Frohawk (antea, p. 213), I may add that they are even more 
abundant in this neighbourhood in the second generation, while on 
August 21st, on the beautiful Chiltern Hills between Kimble and 
Princes Risboro’, they were flying in hundreds, P. brassic@ un- 
doubtedly predominating. A fresh and numerous brood of P. napa 
was also much in evidence, while the scabious, thistles, and hawk- 
weeds—this season in great luxuriance—were visited by the follow- 
ing:—Pamphila comma, Thymelicus flavus (worn), Chrysophanus 
phleas, Polyommatus corydon (males just emerging, very late), 
P. alexis (one very fine female ab. = cerulea-angulata, Tutt), P. 
astrarche (fresh, very small), Gonopteryx rhamni (fine, just out), 
Argynnis aglaia and A. adippe (both in rags), Vanessa 20, Pyrameis 
atalanta; Epinephele jurtina; Aphantopus hyperanthus (still in fair 
condition), and Cenonympha pamphilus ; all, except the ‘ skippers” 
and the “ whites,’ under normal size. On the flower-heads Chareas 
granunis was represented by single examples; and on a windy, bleak 
day in the middle of June I also observed, at the same spot, great 
numbers of Adscita geryon on the helianthemum, and not a few 
Parasemia plantaginis ; butterflies, however, being conspicuous by 
their absence at that date-—H. Rownanp-Brown; Harrow Weald, 
Middlesex. 


PaRYXUS (DEILEPHILA) LIVORNICA AT ExETER.—I wish to record 
taking here, on July 27th, a dead male specimen of P. livornica, under 
an electric light standard in High Street. It was in fairly good con- 
dition.—F. Port; 11, Portland Street, Newtown, Exeter. 


Curious PLACE CHOSEN BY 'TRIPHHNA PRONUBA FOR OVIPOSITING. 
—I have frequently noticed batches of ova deposited on the tarred 
stop-netting round our tennis-courts, but have never been able to 
actually see what insect chose so unpromising a place for the 
purpose. Recently, however, I was fortunate enough to observe a 
moth in the act of oviposition, and after allowing it to deposit about 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 237 


fifty ova captured it, and found it to be the common Yellow Under- 
wing. Wondering what would become of the young larve when 
they found themselves on so peculiar a “ food-plant,’’ I examined 
another batch of ova which had been laid some time previously, and 
found that after slowly eating so much of the egg-shell as was not 
attached to the tarred string, the larva spun a fine thread of silk and 
floated gently to the ground, presumably there to continue its life 
among the grass. It would be interesting to learn whether any 
other observers have noticed the moth doing the same thing in other 
districts Harry EttrrincHam ; South Shields. 

[On July 23rd last I noticed a number of the ova of Mamestra per- 
sicarié on some black thread hanging on the branches of a plum-tree 
in the garden. ‘(The thread, it may be mentioned, had been put over 
the tree to protect the blossom from bird attack in the spring.) In 
one case the eggs were arranged in beautifully neat order, side by 
side, all down a loose end for about four inches of its length: in 
appearance this was not unlike a string of tiny beads. A shorter 
row of eggs was laid on a length of thread that was still stretched 
from one twig to another. This was cut off for examination, and was 
found to have some sixty eggs upon it; of these I kept about half. 
The larvee hatched a few days later, and at first ate the foliage of the 
plum, but when supplied also with knotgrass and other weeds they 
seemed to lose their taste for plum. Larve also hatched out from 
the ova left on the thread in the open, and those that have so far 
escaped their enemies are no doubt feeding upon various plants in the 
garden. At all events I have failed to detect any on the plum-tree, 
although those from the eggs I kept are now (Aug. 27th) nearly full- 
grown.—R. 8.] 


ACRONYCTA ACERIS LARVA FEEDING ON Lapurnum. — Acronycta 
aceris, Li. is not uncommon in this district and, though it occurs on 
sycamore, its favourite food-plant here appears to be horse-chestnut. 
Last autumn (1908) I took a very young Acronyctid larva off 
laburnum, which, as Mr. South suggested when I mentioned it to 
him, turned out to be that of A. aceris, Laburnum seems to be a 
strange food-plant for this species which, however, may be more of a 
general feeder than is usually supposed. When a species is excep- 
tionally abundant it sometimes takes to unusual food-plants, but 
A. aceris was not more frequent than usual last season. I may also 
mention that from the early stage of the larva when I took it, and 
from the way in which it ate the laburnum leaves supplied to it, I 
have no doubt that the egg was laid by the parent on the laburnum- 
tree. I failed however to find any further larve of this species on 
the tree—Aurrep Sic ; Corney House, Chiswick, Aug. 18th, 1909. 


LepipopTeRA IN Hast Sussex.—For the past four years it has 
been my good fortune to spend a portion of the month of August at 
the “ancient town” of Rye. It is a place known chiefly to artists 
and golfers, and has apparently received little attention from ento- 
mologists. Yet it is perhaps better situated as a locality for the 
insect-hunter than any other spot on the south-east coast. The 
town itself rises sharply above the river Rother, and is separated 
from the sea by a mile or more of salterns, the coast being bordered 


238 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


by a long stretch of sandhills. Inland the country consists of the 
river valley—a rush-covered plain divided roughly into fields by 
ditches thick with reeds—and of well-wooded hills. Between these 
hills and the marshes lies the rock on which the town stands. Thus 
there is in its immediate neighbourhood a great variety of country, 
each district rich in the species peculiar to it. In addition, the town, 
which is very brightly lighted, serves as a beacon both to the moths 
which haunt the lowlands and to those bred on the wooded slopes. 
August does not usually appear to be a profitable month for entomo- 
logy. Large numbers of common insects are about, but the choicer 
species have mostly disappeared. During my previous visits, apart 
from some sugaring on the coast, where in 1906 Laphygma exigua 
was common, and where I took Leucania littoralis in addition to 
Agrotis valligera, A. tritict, Hadena chenopodii, C. cytherea, A. citraria, 
and many others, and from light work among the reeds, I did very 
little. During the present year, however, things have been very 
much busier. Although I was only there from Aug. Ist to 16th, and 
could not devote much time to entomology, my list of captures con- 
tains many insects which were wholly unexpected. Probably the 
cold weather of June and July caused many species to postpone their 
emergence until late. The exceptional heat of early August must 
account for the heavy “rise” of moths which took place then. It 
seems most unlikely that the season has favoured the production of 
second broods; although there has been an abundance of green food, 
this would be more than counteracted by the low temperature of June 
and July. Delay in leaving the pupal stage seems to be the probable 
cause of the appearance of certain species in my list. 

During the first part of my visit I spent most of my energies on 
the marshy salterns below the town. Here I found a place, over- 
grown with yellow Galium, in which Mesotype virgata, Cledeobia 
angustalis, and a few other species were swarming. Of the former 
the males were most numerous and in best condition on Aug. 3rd, 
while on Aug. 5th females were everywhere, and scarcely a male 
could be taken. On several nights I worked the reedy ditches and 
small reed-beds which are found all over the salterns, and the results, 
if not very striking, were at least not disappointing. The following 
species were taken:—Nudaria senex (common on Aug. 3rd; one on 
Aug. 9th), Odonestes potatoria, Leucania straminea (a few each night; 
it was not always easy for me to distinguish this species from L. 
impura, which was common, but the under side of stramznea is a good 
guide when the insect is boxed), Senta ulve (one, very worn, on 
Aug. 3rd), Luperina testacea, Miana furuncula, Noctua wmbrosa, N. 
rubt, Acidalia emutarva (not uncommon), Schenobius gigantellus, 
Chilo phragnutellus, and S. forficellus. Though I did not myself 
take S. chrysorrhwa, a nice specimen was given to me which had 
been taken on Aug. 13th by Mr. J. S. Carter at Lydd. It was at light 
that the best results were obtained. Large numbers of insects came 
regularly into the house, and the few nights on which I searched the 
town lamps were richly productive. I will give the complete list of 
captures, adding particulars where such appear interesting :—Sarvro- 
thripa revayana, Hylophila bicolorana (one on Aug. 13th, not a 
perfect specimen), Lithosia lurideola, L. griseola, Arctia cara, Cilix 


RECENT LITERATURE. 239 


glaucata, Pterostoma palpina (Aug. 13th), Pheosia dicteoides (two 
fine specimens Aug. 13th and 15th), Notodonta dromedarius (a 
beautiful specimen Aug. 15th), Cerwra furcula (a fine specimen Aug. 
13th), Bryophila perla (the commonest species at light), B. glandifera 
(a nice uniformly green form Aug. 12th, apparently not common, as 
searching the walls produced only B. perla), Acronycta psi, A. ruma- 
cis (a fine specimen Aug. 11th), Nonagria geminipuncta (one at light 
in the town on Aug. 15th; this seems unusual as there is no reed- 
bed within half a mile of the lamp at which it was taken; it is not 
uncommon in the neighbourhood), Hydrecia paludis, Apamea didyma, 
Xylophasia monoglypha, Cerigo cytherea, Agrotis puta, A. nigricans 
(this is, I believe, an uncommon insect in Sussex, one was taken on 
Aug. 11th), A. tritict, Triphena ianthina, T. pronuba, Calymnia trape- 
zina, C. diffinis (two on Aug. 13th), Phorodesma cytisaria (Aug. 13th), 
C. affinis, Hadena chenopodi, Crocallis elinguaria, Boarmia rhomboi- 
daria, Acidalia rusticata (Aug. 13th and 14th), A. bisetata, A. virgu- 
laria, A. aversata, A. imitaria, Thamnonoma wauaria, Lobophora 
viretata (at light and on walls, Aug. 13th), Hupithecia oblongata, EH. 
assimilata, EH. coronata, and Melanippe fluctuata; also several species 
of the commoner Pyralids and Crambi. 

Such is the list. If it does not contain anything very remarkable, 
the occurrence of certain of the species in August at all is peculiar, 
and an interesting example of the effect which a sudden rise of 
temperature after a cold spell may be expected to produce. I regret 
very much that I did not have time to try sugaring on the coast; 
but from my experience and that of many others this year has not 
been favourable for sugar, and consequently I preferred other methods 
of work. 

I may perhaps mention in conclusion that Rye, excellent as it is 
in itself, is within. easy reach of other famous localities. Abbot’s 
Wood, the Downs and the country round Ashford are all readily 
accessible. My only excursion, however, during the present year 
was to Folkestone, where I spent a glorious though somewhat torrid 
day upon the chalk. My success was not phenomenal. Lycena 
bellargus, which by the end of the month makes the slopes a wonder 
of glancing colour, was not yet out, but Melanargia galatea, Argynnis 
aglaia, Lycena corydon, Adopea thaumas (linea), and Argiades 
sylvanus were allcommon. Of moths the following were captured :— 
Leucamia conigera, Miana furuncula, P. enea, Gnophos obscurata (a 
nice form approaching ab. fasciata), Acidalia ornata, Ematurga 
atomaria, Aspilates gilvarva, Coremia ferrugata, and Ortholitha 
bipunctaria.—H. C. Raven; 7, Canning Street, Liverpool.

Plant Galls of Great Britain: a Native Study Handbook. By 
Epwarp T. Connoup, F.Z.S., F.H.S. With 354 illustrations. 

Pp. i-xii, 1-292. London: Adlard &amp; Son. 1909. 
In December, 1908, we had the pleasure of calling attention to 
Mr. Connold’s ‘British Oak Galls.. What we said of that work 


240 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


equally applies to the present handy and inexpensive little volume. 
The larger book, however, deals specially with galls of the oak, but 
the one under notice treats of all kinds and conditions of plant galls, 
the work of Aphides, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepido- 
ptera, Eriophyide, Anguilluilide, Fungi, &amp;e. 

The excellent illustrations, mainly from photographs, are not only 
of great value in the identification of galls when met with, but if 
any particular gall is wanted, a study of the picture of that gall will 
add considerably to the chance of finding it. 

In the opening chapters much information about galls and their 
producers is condensed, but clearly presented. There are useful lists 
of Host-plants (English and Latin names), so that if the plant is 
known, the nature of the gall thereon is, in most cases, easily 
ascertained. 

We cordially commend this book to all who desire to know some- 
thing authoritative about Plant Galls. 


The Scaly-Winged. By R. B. Henpmrson, M.A., Assistant Master at 
Rugby School. Pp. i-xii, 1-115, 22 illustrations in the text. 
London: Christophers. 1909. 5 


In the preparation of this brief introduction to the study of 
moths and butterflies the author had in view the requirements of. 
Rugbeians who wish to qualify for entering the entomological section 
of the school Natural History Society. 

Among the subjects discussed are: Classification of Organisms ; 
the Four Phases of Lepidoptera; Difference between Butterflies and 
Moths; Bionomics. The student who assimilates all that is set 
down under these heads will have acquired a good groundwork of 
entomological knowledge.

WE are glad to note that this local Society, established only some 
fifteen years ago, and with but a slender list of members for some 
time subsequently, has progressed so well that it is now in a position 
to issue a volume of its ‘Transactions.’ The publication as a whole 
is of considerable merit, and contains some interesting papers. Among - 
those more directly of interest to the entomologist are the follow- 
ing:—The Fauna of Cumberland, in relation to its Physical Geo- 
graphy,” by Frank H. Day, F.E.S. (pp.63-74); “The Butterflies of 
Cumberland,” by George B. Routledge, F.E.S. (pp. 98-118); “The

SOME POINTS IN THE LIFE-HISTORY OF ANTHOMYIA 
SPRETA, MeEtc. 


By W. J. Lucas, B.A., F.E.S. 
(Puate YI.) 


In the early summer there may not infrequently be seen 
a curious white fungus which engirdles the culm of certain 
srasses for nearly an inch of its length (pl. vi, fig. 1). This 
is parasitic on the grass, causing injury to it by checking its 
growth above the part affected by the fungus. A glance at the 
figure shews that the parasite and its host, the grass, bear no little 
similarity to a miniature bullrush, and this resemblance, we may 
assume, suggested the name Hpichloé typhina, Tul., for the fungus. 

To get rid of this fungus is not an easy matter for the 
agriculturist, but fortunately he has somewhat of an ally in 
a small dipteron, Anthomyia spreta, Meig.* This fly lays its eggs 
on the surface of the fungus. They are somewhat cylindrical 
pale bodies, one of which may be seen unhatcbed on fig. 2a 
magnified about six times. When it hatches, the egg splits 
along the side attached to the fungus, and the egg-shell does not 
fall away, but remains where it was first laid. An egg-shell may 
be seen at fig. 2b a little above and to the left of the unhatched 
egg. When they enter the world the little larve find beneath them 
an immediate supply of suitable food, on which they literally make 
incursions, traces of which may be seen below the egg-shell. 

As the larva (fig. 6a, b) grows, the egg-shell does not properly 
cover it, and it builds a waxy tunnel with the egg-shell on its 
surface, and within this it shelters when not making incursions 
into its food. In consequence of this the egg-shell, which was 
cylindrical at first, now has its two broken edges separated from 
one another. The upper surface falls in as it becomes approxi- 
mately flat, and then a ridge in the shape of a long ellipse is 
formed surrounding the depression. This is very well shewn in 
fig. 4. The traces of the incursions made by the larva to obtain 
food are also very clear in this figure, and in the preceding one

also (fig. 3), where the tunnel is inhabited by a larva of smaller 
size. In fig. 5-is depicted the tunnel of a large (if not full- 
grown) larva, the scale of magnification being the same as that 
of figs. 8 and 4. 

Partly grown larve are shewn in fig. 6, a and b. Like so 
many dipterous larve they are simple maggots, means of 
extended locomotion and so forth being unnecessary, since they 
are surrounded by a good supply of suitable food. When full- 
fed the larve fall to the ground, and form around themselves a 
reddish-brown puparium between 3 and 4 mm. long (fig. 7), 
which is again very characteristic of certain groups of the 
Diptera. From this puparium emerges in the following spring 
(though there is probably a partial autumn brood sometimes) a 
little blackish fly (fig. 8), in general appearance not unlike a 
small house-fly, though smaller, for it is but some 9 mm. in 
expanse of wing.

NOTES ON DRAGONFLY PARASITES (LARVAL 
WATER-MITES). 


By F. W. &amp; H. Campion. 


Tue presence of parasitic Arachnida has been detected upon 
insects representing each of the seven great orders. As an ex- 
ample of Hymenoptera attacked in this way, we may mention a 
European sawfly (T'enthredo maura) in the National Collection, 
to which Mr. W. F. Kirby has kindly drawn our attention. The 
Acari found parasitic upon ants and bees are so numerous, both 
in species and in number of individuals, that quite a large 
literature exists upon the subject. More than one collector has 
informed us that mite-attacked Lepidoptera are not infrequently 
met with. Among Diptera, Mr. Charles D. Soar * has figured 
a specimen of Cenia obscura, Mg., with a larval Hydrachnid 
wedged between the thorax and abdomen. Among Coleoptera, 
the same author mentions several species of Dytiscus which serve 
as hosts, and figures an example of D. marginalis with numerous 
mites on its ventral surface, and with some even on one of its

water Mites,” in Journal Quekett Micro. Club, 1906, pp. 359-870, and plates 
26-380. 


NOTES ON DRAGONFLY PARASITES. 243 


legs. All known species of Acari belonging to the genus 
Canestrinia, Berlese, are found upon insects, and mostly upon 
Coleoptera ; numerous Gamaside, when in the immature stages, 
are found wholly or chiefly upon Coleoptera. Prof. C. V. Riley 
has published an interesting account (‘American Naturalist,’ 
xil. p. 189, 1878) of his researches into the life-history of the 
North American locust-mite, to which he gives the name T'rom- 
bidium locustarum. Speaking of the newly-hatched larve, he 
says: ‘‘ These little six-legged specks crawl upon the locusts and 
fasten to them, mostly at the base of the wings or along their 
principal veins.” He adds: ‘‘ That they are often so numerous 
as to weaken and kill their victim, reports clearly prove.” Most 
aquatic Rhynchota are subject to the attacks of water-mites, and 
Prof. Riley says that over five hundred have sometimes been 
counted on a single specimen of Zaitha (Belostoma) fluminea, 
Say, a large American species. Coming to the Neuroptera, we 
may cite a female scorpionfly (Panorpa germanica) taken by 
ourselves in Epping Forest, and having a mite located on the 
under side of the right hind wing. 

It must, however, always be remembered that the word 
‘parasitic’ is used in different senses by various writers, and 
that the meaning of the word as used by most biologists is wider 
in its signification than that attached to it by the popular idea. 
It is necessary to remember this when dealing with the Acari, 
as so many of that group of creatures, particularly in the imma- 
ture stages, seek only conveyance from the host on which they 
are found, and not nourishment ; the parasitism being temporary 
and apparently for the purpose of the distribution of the species 
of mites: this is chiefly confined to terrestrial Acari, as far-as is 
at present known. There are numerous other variations in the 
nature of the relations of the so-called Acarine parasite to the 
host upon which it is found. 

Although water-mites attach themselves so freely to many 
kinds of aquatic insects, we have not yet met with any instance of 
a nymphal dragonfly being attacked by them. Weare acquainted 
with eases in which Acari have attacked imaginal dragonflies 
belonging to the sub-families Libelluline, Gomphine, and 
Agrionine. Among the Libelluline, Sympetrum meridionale is 
a notorious instance: indeed, McLachlan wrote of it that “its 
liability to have the well-known red Acari attached to the wings 
(sometimes in enormous numbers) is so marked as to be almost 
a specific character of the insect itself, few specimens being en- 
tirely free from them” (Ent. Mo. Mag. xx. p. 253, 1884). ‘Thir- 
teen examples of this species taken casually in France were ex- 
hibited by Mr. McLachlan at a meeting of the Entomological 
Society of London. Only one of them had escaped attack, but the 
remaining twelve carried between them no fewer than four hun- 
dred and eighty-one parasites. Single specimens had as many as 

x 2 


244 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


seventy-three, ninety-six, or even one hundred and eleven of them. 
‘‘They were firmly fixed on the nervures towards, and at, the 
base of the wing, and almost (but not quite) invariably on the 
under side, and whatever might be the number on any particular 
dragonfly it was always divided nearly symmetrically on the 
two sides of the insect, those much infested having a very pretty 
appearance, from the wings appearing as if spotted with blood- 
red’’ (Ent. Mo. Mag. xiii. p. 95, 1876). Two excellent plates ac- 
company a paper by M. Krendovsky on the economy of the larve of 
Hydrachnide published in a Russian periodical (Trud. Charkov 
Uniy., 1878, Tom. xii, pp. 221-286). Figure 7 on Plate 1 shows 
a specimen of S. meridionale having numerous mites, coloured 
red, distributed in a remarkably symmetrical manner along the 
principal nervures of the wings. Another figure (8) on the same 
plate represents, again in colour, three of the mites on a large 
scale. These mites are described as the six-legged larve of 
Arrhenurus papillator (Mull.), but, as will appear later, this 
determination is by no means certain. 

Krendovsky also states that Hydrachnid larve occur on the 
sternum of S. flaveolum. This is the only case which has come 
to our knowledge in which larve have been found on the body 
of an Anisopterid dragonfly. Some of the specimens of S. fons- 
colombu taken by Mr. C. A. Briggs in Surrey in 1892 were much 
affected by a dark carmine-coloured Acarus; on one of the 
dragonflies he counted as many as eighty-five parasites. Mr. 
Briggs asks, ‘‘Do these Acari extract any colouring matter from 
their host ? They exactly match the colouring of the nervures, 
and one that I squeezed gave out a similar coloured fluid” 
(Ent. Mo. Mag., ss. iii. p. 194, 1892). SS. striolatum has also 
been mentioned in this connection, but apparently in error for 
S. meridionale. 

An example among the Gomphine is afforded by a female of 
Platygomphus dolabratus from India in the British Museum, 
which has a red parasite on the left hind wing. 

But it is among the Agrionine that Acari are met with most 
abundantly, and our own collection furnishes examples of six 
species which are infested to a greater or smaller extent. Those 
species are Hrythromma naias, Pyrrhosoma nymphula, Ischnura 
elegans, Agrion pulchellum, A. puella, and Enallagma cyathigerum. 
We have also noticed an immature female of P. tenellum in the 
Stephens cabinet carrying a single mite on the sternum. 
Furthermore, Krendovsky includes Lestes in the category of 
mite-attacked dragonflies. In all the cases which have come 
under our personal observation, the parasites are attached to the 
under side of the thorax or abdomen, or both (but never to the 
wings), sometimes in twos and threes, sometimes covering the 
entire surface affected. In life they appear to the unaided eye 
as globose bodies less than a millimetre in diameter when fully

grown, colourless at first, but usually reddish or reddish-brown 
in later life. Unless they are placed immediately in a preserva- 
tive fluid, however, they quickly lose both their colour and 
rotundity. We have always noticed that mites occur most 
plentifully when their Zygopterid hosts are but newly on the 
wing, and it would seem that dragonflies rid themselves of their 
parasites to a great extent as the season advances. We have, 
however, a mite-attacked male of H. cyathigerum taken at the 
Black Pond, Surrey, as late as September 3rd. It would also 
seem that some larve leave the egg much sooner than do others, 
for we have met with teneral specimens of P. nymphula early in 
May and teneral examples of EH. cyathigerum towards the end of 
July carrying larve in the same colourless and ungrown condi- 
tion. Although, as we have seen, locusts are weakened and even 
killed by the attacks of parasites, there is no evidence before us 
of injury done to Odonata in this way. 

The occasional presence of mites upon Odonata was known 
so long ago as 1778, when De Geer figured and described red 
parasites from the thorax of a small dragonfly under the name 
Acarus libellule, and identified them with the A. gymnopterorum 
of Linneus. By these and other old writers they were regarded 
as adult forms, but it was subsequently recognised that these 
six-legged creatures were larval forms which in later life acquired 
the fourth pair of legs proper to Arachnida. As we have seen, 
Krendovsky called some larve from the wings of an Anisopterid 
dragonfly Arrhenurus papillator, and, following him, Mr. Soar 
considered parasites from the bodies of such dragonflies as Agrion 
pulchellum and A. puella to be no other than Arrhenurus globator. 
We have made several enquiries with a view to clearing up the 
doubts which still exist respecting the affinities of dragonfly 
parasites with other larval Hydrachnide, but we have failed to 
elicit any definite information, owing to these parasitic stages 
being so little understood. Three species of Zygopterides with 
mites attached to their bodies were submitted for examination 
to the eminent Hydrachnologist, Herr I’. Koenike, of Bremen. 
He has kindly informed us that the parasites belong to ditferent 
species of Hydrachnide, but to the same genus. At present he 
is unable to say with certainty into which genus the larve fall, 
but in any case he does not agree with those authors who have 
referred them to Arrhenurus. Attempts made by Herr Koenike to 
rear dragonfly parasites have not been successful, but he has bred 
the real larva of A. globator, and he is satisfied that the parasites 
in question have nothing whatever to do with Arrhenurus larve. 

It was suggested by McLachlan that the parasites may 
attain their position on the body or wings of a dragontly by 
climbing up the legs of their host while it is at rest. This 
suggestion, in itself a likely one, is rendered the more probable 
by the fact that in our experience of Zygopterides the mites 


246 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


appear on the sternum of their host earlier than on the abdomen. 
Moreover, all the Odonata carrying Acari on their wings which 
have come under our notice belong to the Anisopterid division, 
whereas all the Zygopterid dragonflies which we have known to 
be infested have borne their parasites upon the inferior surface 
of the thorax or abdomen, or both, but never on the wings. 
Also, as we have seen in the case of the Anisopterid Sympetrwm 
meridionale, mites attach themselves to the lower surface of the 
wings more readily than to the upper surface. These circum- 
stances will be better understood when it is remembered that 
Anisopterid dragonflies rest with their wings spread out hori- 
zontally, while Zygopterid dragonflies in a state of repose 
generally hold their wings erect. And the frequency with which 
the smaller dragonflies are attacked is no doubt accounted for 
by the fact that they habitually cling to rushes and other aquatic 
vegetation when not in flight, while the larger species usually 
take shelter among the branches of trees, high above the level 
of the water. 

Our cordial thanks are due to Mr. Albert D. Michael both 
for directing our correspondence with specialists and for perusing 
these notes in draft; to Mr. Francis P. Marchant for helping with 
the Russian literature consulted ; and to Mr. W. F. Kirby for kind 
and ready assistance rendered on this and many other occasions. 


Notre.—Since the foregoing was written, I have had the advantage of dis- 
cussing this matter with Dr. F’. Ris during an interview with him at Brussels. 
Although Sympetrum meridionale and S. fonscolombii are the only Odonata 
he has met with carrying Acari on the wings, he has found several imaginal 
Anisopterids—such as Cordulia enea, Libellula quadrimaculata, and species 
of Leucorrhinia—having Acari on the thorax and abdomen. Furthermore, 
he told me that a large proportion of the nymphs collected by him in Swit- 
zerland have been infested with Acarine parasites, and, in the cases of Sym- 
petrum sanguineum and Hnallagma cyathigerwm, he has actually witnessed 
the mites passing from the nymphal skin on to the skin of the imago while 
the emergence of the dragonfly has been taking place.—H. C.

SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES.* 
By W. G. SHexpon, F.E.S. 


Wirn so much of Hastern Europe at present closed to the 
lepidopterist who values his safe return home, Hungary offers one 
of the chief centres for observing certain butterflies, the area of 
distribution of which does not extend so far west as the Alps; 
and for this reason most of us get there sooner or later. 

* Among other comparatively recent papers on Hungarian butterflies 
may be mentioned two published in this Journal :—“ A Fortnight’s Collecting 
at Budapest,” by W. E. Nicholson, F.E.S. (vol. xxv. pp. 191-198, 210-212) ; 


‘Two Seasons among the Butterflies of Hungary and Austria,” by Margaret 
kK. Fountaine, F.E.S. (vol. xxxi. pp. 281-89). 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. QAT 


With the companion of several previous expeditions, Mr. 
K. F. S. Tylecote, I reached Budapest on May 29th last. The 
next day the net was unfurled on the Schwabenberg, or Svab- 
hegy as it is called in Magyar, a hill several miles west of 
Budapest, best reached by taking the electric tram from the 
west end of the Franz Josef Bridge over the Danube as far as 
the Varos Major terminus of the rack and pinion railway, by 
which one then travels to the station of Svab-hegy itself. 

Svab-hegy is a large rounded hill, rising to perhaps six or 
eight hundred feet above the surrounding country, fast becoming 
a suburb of Budapest, and already covered in parts with villas. 
But it has still considerable stretches of uncultivated land, con- 
sisting of grassy slopes, rough ground thickly covered with a 
growth of herbs and flowers, and stretches of wood, chiefly oak, 
with open glades in places; the subsoil is calcareous. 

On leaving the station one follows the line which terminates 
at the top of the hill further on by taking the road on the left 
side, running parallel to it for a few hundred yards, until 
a flight of wooden steps is seen leading to the left up the hill- 
side, at the top of which is a patch of oak scrub of several acres 
in extent, with some nice glades running through and amongst 
it. Here were plenty of butterflies, amongst them Canonympha 
iphis and C. arcania being abundant; the latter a fine, large, 
bright form; the former with the ocelli much larger than in 
French or Swiss examples; Melitea phoebe was frequent, and 
the slow flight of Leucophasia sinapis was unmistakable. A 
large Hesperiid flying plentifully rapidly to and fro was netted, 
and proved to be H. carthami ; various species of the Lycenide 
were seen, including Lycena hylas, L. bellargus, L. icarus, and 
Rusticus argus (egon), which was abundant. 

Proceeding further I came to a large open space thickly 
covered with flowering plants, almost to the exclusion of grass, 
and including the fine purple Salvia pratensis (a rare British 
plant), various species of vicia, and numerous composites. 
The wealth of insect life here was quite unusual, and, in 
addition to butterflies, one came across many moths found 
in Britain, including Lithostege griseata, Agrophila sulphuralis, 
Scoria lineata, Heliothis dipsacea, and Acontia luctuosa; an 
assemblage which it would be difficult to meet with in our islands 
in one field. With them occurred in abundance the butterfly 
which was the chief object of my visit to Svab-hegy—the lively 
little black and white skipper Pyrgus orbifer, which reaches at 
Budapest almost its western limit. My predecessors, who had 
visited Hungary in early June, had invariably found this species 
passé. On this day it was considerably past its best, and I had 
to use much selection to get a good series. I should give the 
middle of May as the best time; its habits of flight are similar to 
Hesperia malve, which was equally common with it; on the wing 


248 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


one has difficulty in separating the two species, except that 
P. orbifer is somewhat browner in colour; a few examples also 
of Hesperia alveus were flitting about with the other two species. 

The hill culminates in a bare ridge, commanding a fine view 
of the plain and the river Danube; here freshly emerged 
Parnassius mnemosyne were not infrequent, these being distinctly 
larger than my Swiss examples, and having the black blotches 
in both sexes smaller, darker, and better defined. An odd 
Chysophanid turned out to be a female of C. thersamon, a new 
species to me, and also a good example of Melitea trivia was 
netted, but not recognised until I got home. 

We paid further visits to Svab-hegy on the 8rd, 5th and 7th 
of June, and were rewarded each day by interesting species, 
including the fine form of Polyommatus orion var. ornata, not 
uncommon in the oak glades amongst the sedum plants; 
Melitea trivia was not infrequent, but very local, some of the 
specimens being already past their best. But by hard work I 
managed to get together eighteen or twenty good examples. 
M. trivia is easily recognised in flight from its confreres, for it is 
the swiftest species of the genus I have seen; and this habit, 
with its small size, makes it difficult sometimes to follow with 
the eye. From its nearest relation M. didyma, the lesser size and 
darker colour serve to distinguish M. trivia at once, whilst from 
the only species of its size flying at the same date, M. aurelia, 
it is at once separated by the more rapid flight. In one field 
M. aurelia was abundant. I used to think that specimens of 
this species, or those that I could not separate from it, taken at 
high altitudes in Switzerland, flying with M. parthenie var. 
varia, were only forms of the latter, and I do not know that this 
opinion has been much changed since; but certainly MZ. aurelia 
seems distinct enough in Hungary from any other species of 
the genus, the specimens being strictly typical and showing no 
approach to M. parthenie or to any other species; and being at 
once distinguished from M. athalia, which was flying at Buda- 
pest in early June, by size and general appearance. WM. didyma 
was just emerging; the examples were brightly coloured and 
of good size. I was much surprised to net, in a glade at 
the top of the steps before-mentioned, a fine example of Neptis 
lucilla, a species I had not expected to come across at Budapest. 

I had been provided by my friend Mr. A. H. Jones, who 
most kindly placed at my disposal the results of his successful 
visit to Hungary two years previously, a letter of introduction 
to Herr Aigner of the Budapest National Museum. Accordingly 
we called there on May 81st, but learnt that Herr Aigner had 
been unable to follow his duties at the Museum for a consider- 
able time; and I am sure all who are interested in entomology, 
especially those who have visited Hungary, will greatly regret 
that his long illness terminated fatally in June. 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 249 


- On making known that we wished to see the Museum collec- 
tion of Hungarian butterflies, we were most kindly welcomed by 
Dr. Soos, and introduced to Professor Schmidt, who was in 
charge of the insect department. To this gentleman we are 
deeply indebted for his great kindness to us during our stay at 
Budapest, for during that time he placed himself and his know- 
ledge entirely at our disposal, acquainting us with the best 
localities for the species we wished to get, and accompanying 
us there, interpreting, and assisting us in every possible 
manner. This assistance was exceptionally valuable, for Buda- 
pest is a most difficult district to work, primarily because all the 
best localities are at some distance, and also because there does 
not appear to exist a suitable map of the environs. 

On the 1st of June we accompanied Professor Schmidt to 
Kamaraerdo, our chief object being to obtain series of the two 
local species of Chrysophanus found in the Danube marshes, 
C. dispar var. rutilus, and C. thersamon. To my note on the 
former species (see ‘Entomologist,’ antea, pp. 219-220) I will 
only add that on this day I captured twelve males and three 
females, most of them in perfect condition. Of C. thersamon I 
obtained eleven males and one female, all in good order. 
C. thersamon, unlike C. var. rutilus, frequents flowers, chiefly 
those of Salvia pratensis, settlng on them and exposing its bril- 
liant upper side to catch the warmth of the sun. Great quantities 
of Aporia crategi were flying everywhere, and some of the assem- 
blies congregated on the damp patches on the road were enor- 
mous, and must have consisted of several hundred individuals. 

The country collected over was a valley extending from 
Kamaraerdo station to the village of Promontor, some three 
miles distant, and from which electric trams conveyed us to the 
foot of the Franz Josef Bridge at Budapest ; asa matter of fact, 
after our first journey we travelled by tram, which we found 
much quicker and more convenient than by taking the train. 

On a subsequent visit to this locality (June 4th), Professor 
Schmidt being unable to accompany us, Dr. Soos most kindly 
acted as our chaperon. This was very desirable and probably 
saved us some unpleasantness, for the butterflies were on 
cultivated ground, the owners of which I understand have been 
known to object strongly to strangers wandering amongst their 
crops, but the Museum authorities can go anywhere. On this 
occasion Chrysophanus var. rutilus was abundant, and my bag of 
twenty-three examples included half a dozen females. I also 
captured a fair example of Thais polyxena, and saw a few small 
larve of that species on the food-plant, Aristolochia clematitis. 
Argynnis niobe var. erts was just coming out. Chrysophanus 
thersamon was by this date practically over, and all the examples 
observed were hopeless as cabinet specimens. 

On the 6th of June we again visited the marsh; but the day 


250 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


was a bad one with little sun, and beyond a few more Chryso- 
phanus var. rutilus we did not observe anything worthy of note. 

On the 8th of June we took the early morning train to Szada, 
a residence of Baron Vécsez, who had invited us to spend the 
day there. We were met at the station by a carriage, in which 
we drove several miles to the house, where we were received 
with characteristic Hungarian kindness and hospitality, and 
enjoyed a most delightful visit. In the morning we were con- 
ducted by Baron Vécsez through a tract of country consisting 
chiefly of vineyards and orchards, in which many of the bare- 
footed and picturesquely clad peasantry of both sexes were work- 
ing, to some fine woods crowning rising ground; here we were 
pleased to come across Chrysophanus alciphron in large numbers 
and in splendid condition. The day unfortunately was cloudy with 
rain, and we had only a few minutes sun, but during that time 
managed to secure about thirty specimens and also some Melitea 
trivia and Argynnis adippe var. cleodoxa. I found at rest a 
female of Rusticus argyronomon (argus), which is certainly the 
finest form I have ever seen of that species, and has a very 
pronounced and brilliant orange band on the under side of the 
hind wings. 

In returning we were shown some banks covered with 
Aristolochia clematitis, on which the larve of Thais polyxena 
were feeding in enormous numbers; it would not have been 
difficult, I believe, to collect 1000 larve or even more, but I 
contented myself with about five dozen full-grown examples, 
which have since produced over fifty fine pups. In the after- 
noon we looked through Baron Vécsez’s collection of Hungarian 
lepidoptera, which contained some interesting specimens. 

Our last day in the neighbourhood of Budapest (June 12th) 
was devoted to the famous locality of Pészer. Before visiting 
Hungary I had a very indefinite idea where this place was 
situated ; for beyond stating that you took the train from Buda- 
pest to Dabas, a two hours’ journey, all the accounts I could find 
of those that had visited Pészer were silent, and as Baedeker does 
not mention Dabas and Bradshaw knows it not, I had not the 
remotest idea of the direction in which it lay or how to get 
there. It may therefore not be out of place to state that the 
station in the railway guide is named Also Dabas, which means 
Lower Dabas, and is situated about thirty miles south-east of 
Budapest, on the railway to Lajosmizse. 

Leaving Budapest by the early morning train we arrived on 
the ground about 10.30 a.m. I can quite understand the 
enthusiasm which this wood produces on all who visit it. 
Peszer is indeed a wonderful locality for Diurni, which were 
far more plentiful than I saw elsewhere in Hungary; in fact, 
I have not seen anywhere in Europe a locality in which butter- 
flies were in greater abundance. Various causes have probably 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 251 


produced this luxuriance of individuals. Pészer is one of the few 
spots which has probably always been uneultivated, a remnant 
of the old Pannonian Forest which once covered the whole of 
the country; the soil is of a warm sandy nature, and the 
vegetation luxuriant and varied. 

Immediately on unfolding our nets we were confronted with 
the difficulty, amidst such riches, of not knowing what to choose. 
Swarms of Brenthis hecate, in perfect condition, hovered over 
the grass, and B. hecate is not an easy species to obtain. A 
series of it was therefore one of our first objects ; they were very 
different to my Spanish examples, with much smaller blotches 
on the upper side, and with the chestnut blotches and the mark- 
ings generally on the under side of the hind wings much more 
brilliant. The fine Chrysophanus alciphron was almost equally 
numerous, flitting about in the clearings and settling on the 
flowers. A series of two dozen was soon secured, including nine 
or ten females, and then one found that numerous Theclas were 
flying round and settling on the oak bushes, presently identified 
as Thecla acacia, the first time I had seen it alive, and 7’. ilicis ; 
both of them in the finest condition. Melitea trivia was 
abundant, but going over, and good specimens required con- 
siderable selection. Bright yellow Coliads flew wildly here and 
there ; several I caught were certainly only Colias edusa, but 
one I missed looked very like C. myrmidone, and was the only 
example of the species I came across in Hungary, if it was it. 
To the Skippers flitting briskly to and fro 1 had not much time 
to devote; but Hesperia carthami was abundant, also Pamphila 
sylvanus, and either P. linea or P. lineola, or both ; Carcharodus 
lavatere was also not infrequent. 

Naturally we made a careful search for Melanargia var. 
suwarovius, but with not much anticipation of success, for this 
species has of late years become very rare at Pészer—the cumula- 
tive bag for the last three years consisting, so far as 1 could 
learn, of only seven examples, and our search was unsuccessful. 
I may here mention that Professor Schmidt informed me on my 
return to Budapest in July that M. var. suwarovius has not been 
seen this year. 

Intending visitors to Pészer should note that it is Crown 
property, and that a permit, difficult to obtain, has this year for 
the first time been required; and they should before going 
enquire at the Budapest Museum, the authorities of which can, 
and no doubt would, do their best to assist. 

On my return to Budapest on July 2nd I searched carefully 
the capsules of Colutea arborescens at Farkas Volgy for larve of 
Lycena iolas, which I was informed should there be plentiful, 
but without success; probably the bad season was responsible 


for the failure.

In 8. Ashanti, according to Dr. Graham (supra), ‘‘ very large 
numbers of these insects were found on the diseased trees, and 
not on the healthy ones. They appear to damage the trees by 
perforating the bark and so producing ‘ gumming.’”’

Black; posterior lateral margins to pronotum, base and costal 
margin to corium, irregular segmental spots to connexivum, lateral 
areas of meso- and metasterna and disk of abdomen beneath fuscous 
or brownish-ochraceous ; antenne incrassate, basal joint considerably 
thickened and shorter than fourth joint, second gradually thickened 
from base, globosely incrassate at apex and about as long as head 
and pronotum together, second and third joints very stout and pyri- 
form, third longer than fourth; pronotum slightly but distinctly 
gibbous behind the anterior pronotal angles, rugose, with scattered 
tubercles ; scutellum prominently raised, rugose and tuberculate, the 
apex robustly posteriorly produced and slightly curved downward ; 
membrane opaque, considerably passing the abdominal apex; tibize 
robust and strongly shortly pilose, the tarsi stramineous. Long

pronotum and scutellum, and the more apically recurved 
scutellum.

A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF ORNEODIDAE. 253 


Mr. Dudgeon calls the species the ‘‘ Cocoa-bark Sapper,” 
and it is thus referred to in his ‘ Fourth Report on Agricultural 
and Forest Products of the Gold Coast to Secretary of State 
Colonies, 1909.’ 


A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF ORNEODIDZ (Lep.).

Besides the above-quoted type the genus Microschismus 
contains the following new species :— 


Microschismus antennatus, 0, sp. 


3. Exp.16mm. Labial palpi very long (about thrice length of 
head), down-curved, densely scaled so that proportions of joints are 
not visible but third joint is apparently very short, fuscous. Maxil- 
lary palpi absent. Haustellum feebly developed. Head roughly

very slight yellow tinge minutely irrorated with dark-fuscous dots, 
especially evident on basal third: bases of third, fourth, and fifth 
clefts outlined in dark-fuscous, forming a conspicuous line running 
obliquely inwards across the wing; first segment crossed by two in- 
distinct dark-fuscous bands at about one-third and two-thirds of its 
length; remaining segments cut by a moderate dark-fuscous band at 
about three-fifths of their lengths, preceded and followed by slightly 
paler spaces; apices of all segments with a blackish dot. Cilia

light-fuscous mixed with darker: on costa suffused with dark-fuscous 
to about half, with dark-fuscous dots just before and beyond two- 
thirds; on all segments darker opposite dark bands. Hind wing 
cleft into six segments: first cleft from within half, second from 
about a quarter, third from beneath base of first cleft, fourth from 
about one-third, fifth from about one-sixth; segments linear: light 
fuscous irrorated with darker. Cilia light-fuscous, very long on 
dorsal margin. 

Type ¢ in Oxford University Museum. It is labelled 
‘Orange River Colony, near Bothaville, Valsch River, five 
miles from Vaal, Blockhouse No. 74, captured April to mid- 
June, 1902, and presented 1902 by E. N. Bennett.’ It also 
bears a manuscript label, ‘‘May 1st, Blockhouse.’ I am 
indebted to Professor E. B. Poulton for the opportunity of 
examining this specimen. 

M. antennatus differs from M. fortis in its smaller size and 
more dingy coloration, but is easily separated in the male sex 
by the antenne, which are only very shortly ciliated in the type 
(male) of fortis which I have been able to examine through the 
kind courtesy of Lord Walsingham. 


ON THE HYMENOPTEROUS PARASITES OF COCCIDA. 
By Cuaupe Mortey, F.Z.S., F.H.S. 


Tue extremely injurious nature of the Homoptera included in 
this family is perhaps better appreciated in warmer climates 
than in Britain, where the amount of damage annually done to 
our fruit-trees, &amp;c., by these insects is by no means at present 
fully recognized. When this is the case it will be more clearly 
seen to what a very great extent the Hymenopterous parasites 
which destroy them are our friends than we are at present 
inclined to allow. Many of our leading entomologists, I have 
no hesitation in saying, are entirely ignorant that Coccids are 
attacked by the Parasitica at all; and since so little is published 
upon the subject in my friend Mr. Newstead’s admirable ‘ Mono- 
graph of the Coccide of the British Isles’ (Ray Soc. 1900 et 
1902), no apology is, I think, needed for bringing forward in as 
succinct a form as possible what is known of this fascinating 
subject. Iam greatly indebted to Mr. Newstead for assistance 
in the Hemipterous synonymy, and to Ashmead’s paper ‘‘ On 
the Genera of the Chalcid Flies belonging to the Subfamily 
Encyrtine”’ (Proc. U.S. Nat. Museum, 1900, pp. 823-412) for 
the elucidation of at least one of the main groups of these 
beneficial insects. 

Extra-British hosts are denoted by an asterisk. 


HYMENOPTEROUS PARASITES OF COCCID. 955 


1. ASPIDIOTUS. 

From unidentified members of this genus Howard (‘ Revision 
of the Apheline of North America,’ 1895, p. 21) bred Perissop- 
terus pulchellus, and (lib. cit. p. 42) Ablerus clisiocampe, Ashm., 
which latter had been originally raised from a Lepidopteron. 
Dalla Torre says that Aphelinus annulicornis, Ratz., has also 
been bred from this genus, though Ratzeburg (Ichn. d. Forst. 
ill. 195) simply gives it as preying upon some ‘‘ Coccus.”’ 


2. Aspidiotus perniciosus, Comst.* 
Howard (loc. cit. 27) tells us that Aphelinus fuscipennis preys 
on this species, and Ashmead also represents Rhopoideus citrinus, 
How., as destroying it in California. 


3. Aspidiotus ancylus, Putn.* 


Both Prospalta aurantit and Physcus varticornis are named 
by Howard (l. c. 41 et 48) from specimens bred from this species. 


4. Aspidiotus abietis, Schr.* 

Many males and one female of Coccobius circumscriptus, 
Ratzeburg, were bred by him (ichn. d. Forst. 111. 195) from 
Coccus pini, together with his C. luteus and single male C. incon- 
spicuus (l.c. 196 et 210). Aspidiotus pint, Comst., is given as 
the host of Prospalta aurantit, How. (Revis. 41), and by Gaulle 
(Cat. Hym. France, 106) of Aphelinus agriope, Walk. 


5. Aspidiotus ostreeformis, Curt. 

The synonymous A. tili@, Bché., is said by Ratzeburg (J. c. ii. 
148, iii. 189 et 192) to have produced Hncyrtus dendripennis and 
E. hirsutus, very possibly also E. longicornis; the first is now 
synonymised with Habrolepis zetterstedtii, Westw., and the last 
with Hricydnus longicornis, Dalm. Gaulle (Cat. 106) adds 
Azotus marchali, How., and Archenomus bicolor, How., to its 
parasites, and Ashmead (p. 409) says the cosmopolitan Arrheno- 
phagus chionaspidis, Aur., attacks Diaspis ostreeformis, Sign. 


6. Aspidiotus hedere, Vall. 

This is destroyed by Prospalta aurantii, Howard (Revis. 41), 
and, under its better-known name, A. nerit, Behé., Tyler Towns- 
end bred four examples of Signiphora aspidiotii, Ashm. (p. 412) 
from it in Mexico in November, 1894; Ashmead gives (p. 411) 
his S. mexicana and (p. 409) Arrhenophagus chionopsidis, Aur., 
as attacking it, and Gaulle (Cat. 106) Aspidiotiphagus citrinus, 
Crawf. 

7. Aspidiotus uve, Comst.* 

Howard describes (‘ Insect Life,’ 1894, p. 6) his Prospalta 

murtfeldtii from this species. 


256 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


8. Aspidiotus zonatus, Frauenf. 

Under the name Maskellia zonata, Green, Ashmead records 
this species as the host of Anagyrus greenti, How., from Ceylon 
(p. 854), and A. quercicola, Bché. (probably the A. quercus of 
Signoret), is given by Dr. Giraud (Ann. Soc. France, 1877, 
p. 421 et 424) as sustaining Habrolepis dalmani, Westw., and— 
almost certainly in error—Callimome coccorum, Gir. (quoted by 
Gaulle, 100). Cf. also Howard, Proc. U. 8S. Nat. Mus. 1896, 
p- 639. 

9. Aspidiotus corticalis, Riley MS.* 

From a species so named by Ashmead, Howard (Descer. of 
N. American Chalcid. 1885, p. 18) instances Encyrtus ensifer, 
which is placed by the former (p. 888) in the genus Coccid- 
encyrtus. 

10. Aspidiotus cydonte, Comst.* 

His Floridan Signiphora flavopalliata is instanced as preying 

upon this species by Ashmead (p. 411). 


11. Chrysomphalus aurantii, Mask. 

This Aspidiotus is recorded, together with its var. citrinus, 
Coquil., as having been attacked by Aspidiotiphagus citrinus by 
Howard (Revis. Aphel. N. Am. p. 81) ; by Coccophagus lunulatus, 
How. (‘Insect life,’ 1894, p. 282); by Aphycus immaculatus, 
How. (J. ¢. p. 236) in California; and the above var. by Signi- 
phora occidentalis, How. (1. c. p. 234) from the same locality. 


12. Chrysomphalus ficus, Ashm. 


Like the last species, this is said by Howard (I. c.) to be 
attacked by Aspidiotiphagus citrinus. 


13. Howardia biclavis, Comst. 


Aphelinus thee is described by Cameron (Manchester Mem. 
1891, p. 183) from the synonymous Aspidiotus thee, Green. 
Cf. also Indian Museum Notes, 1894, p. 182. 


14. Odonaspis secreta, Ckll.* 


From this species, under the genus Aspidiotus, Ashmead in 
1900 (p. 404) records Homalopoda cristata, but I fail to follow 
Dalla Torre (Cat. Hym. v. 240), since this association is not 
given in Ashmead’s original description. 


15. Fiorinia saprosome, Green.* 


The cosmopolitan Arrhenophagus chionaspidis, Aur., has been 
bred by Howard from this species (Ashm. 1900, p. 409, &amp;c.). 


16. Draspis. 
In his Revis. Aphel., Howard records his Aphelinus diaspidis 


HYMENOPTEROUS PARASITES OF COCCIDAL. 257 


from an uncertain species—rendered ‘‘ Diaste”? by D. T.—of 
this genus. 
17. Diaspis rose, Behé. 

This has been often parasitised : by Aphelinus diaspidis, How. 
(Revis. p. 26); by Aspidiotiphagus citrinus, How. (1. ¢. p. 81) ; by 
Phenodiscus (Hneyrtus) eneus, Dalm., which was bred from it in 
Austria by Mayr (Verh. z.-b. Ges. 1875, p. 758); by Aphycus 
brunneus, How. (Descr. N. A. Chal. p. 17); by Arrhenophagus 
chionaspidis, Aur. (Ent. Tidsk. 1888, p. 146); and by Coccobius 
diaspidis, Ashm. (1900, p. 408), at Washington. The synonymous 
Aulacaspis (Aspidiotus) rose is said by Ratzeburg (Ichn. d. Forst. 
ili. 196) to have been bred by Bouché, and to have produced 
Coccobius notatus ; Gaulle (Cat. 26) quotes Cameron (Brit. Phyt. 
Hym. iil. 233) in saying that the Cynipid Allotria erythrothoraz, 
Htg., preys upon it. Newstead does not determine the Encyrtus 
(Mon. Brit. Coce. i. 81) which causes the female to swell and the 
skin to become “highly chitinised.”’ 


18. Diaspis carueli, Targ. 


This is one of the four hosts given by Howard (Revis. p. 25) 
for Chalcis (Aphelinus) mytilaspidis, Baron. 


19. Aulacaspis pentagona, Targ. 
Like A. ros@ above, this species is given by Howard (Revis. 
p. 31) as attacked by Aspidiotiphagus citrinus. 


20. Chionaspis eleagni, Green.* 

C. eleagniis a host of Physcus variicornis, according to Howard 
(Revis. p. 43). 

21. Chionaspis salicis, Linn. 

The Tridymid, Tritypus areolatus, is said by Ratz. (Ichn. iil. 
227) to have been bred by Hr. Nordlinger from a Coccus on Salix 
aurita, from which the parasite emerged through a lateral hole. 
Arrhenophagus chionaspidis is said by Aurivillius (Hint. Tidsk. 
1888, p. 146) to have emerged from this species (yuoted by Ashm. 
p- 409), and Gaulle gives (Cat. 100) Habrolepis zetterstedtt, 
Westw., as also attacking it. From a species of Coccid on willow, 
but unnamed, Ashmead says (p. 398) that Microterys bolus, Walk., 
has been bred at Hudson’s Bay. 


22. Chionaspis graminis, Green.* 
From this species Howard (Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus. 1896, p. 637) 
records his Mncyrtus chionaspidis, from Ceylon (placed in the 


genus Adelencyrtus by Ashm. p. 402), as well as his Procto- 
trypid Anthemus chionaspidis (1. ¢. p. 643).

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


THe Hasrrar or Araynnis Laopice.—The Hon. N. Charles 
Rothschild informs me that he has recently found another locality 
for Argynnis laodice, in the Réz Mountains near Cséhtelek, in the 
Bihar Comitat, Hungary. He found this species at a lower elevation 
than before, frequenting a damp situation at the edge of a wood 
where Hupatorium cannabinum (hemp agrimony) grows, the flowers 
of which were attractive to the butterflies, this making the third 
locality, but the species appears rare in the district. In the ‘ Societas 
Entomologiea,’ xxiv., nos. 4-5, is a very favourable review by M. von 
Gillmer of the life-history of A. laodice, which I published in the 
March number of the ‘Entomologist.’ This gentleman refers to 
the distribution of this species; from which we now learn that the 
most westerly limit for laodice is Massow, near Stettin, Pomerania, 
which is 124° east of Greenwich. In my paper I mentioned that 
Cséhtelek in Hungary was probably the most westerly point where 
laodice occurred. Respecting the hatching of the egg of this butter- 
fly Von Gillmer mentions that a few eggs out of several which had 
been subjected to warmth hatched in the autumn. This of course 
applies to most, if not all, eggs and cannot be considered as a proof 
that the eggs would hatch at all in the autumn under natural con- 
ditions. All the eggs I had under observation were kept in a cool place, 
and all hatched during the latter part of February.—F. W. FronAwKE. 


A Species or THE Nocruipa NEw To ScrencE.—On July 24th 
last, Mr. Esson, of Aberdeen, sent for identification a noctuid moth 
that he had taken, at sugar, on a fir tree, twelve days earlier in the 
month. As the specimen could not be referred to any species with 
which I was acquainted, it was submitted to Sir George F'. Hampson 
at the Natural History Museum. At first Sir George was inclined 
to consider the novelty referable to the N. American genus Morrisonia, 
Grote, but after further examination he decided that a new genus 
would have to be founded for its reception. This matter, as well as 
naming and describing the specimen, has been left in his hands. In 
general appearance, it may be noted, the moth suggests a pale reddish 
grey aberration of Lycophotia (Agrotis) rip@; but it has hairy eyes, 
« prominent thoracic crest, and well-defined tufts on the abdomen ; 
it cannot, therefore, be a member of the Agrotinz. Jam very pleased 
to add that the Hon. N. Charles Rothschild acquired this interesting 
specimen and has generously presented it to the National Collection.— 
RICHARD SOUTH. 


PLECOPTERA, NEUROPTERA AND TRICHOPTERA FROM THE PYRENEES 
OrtenTALES.—Dr. T. A. Chapman kindly passed on to me the insects 
belonging to these orders which he took at Amelie-les-Bains, April 
6th—21st, 1909, and at Vernet-les-Bains, April 24th to May 9th, 1909. 
They were :—* Teniopteryx seticornis, Klap., Vernet. Nemowra, 
apparently of the group marginata, two females, one from Amelie, the 
other from Vernet. Chrysopa aspersa, Vernet. Hemerobius subnebu- 
losus, Amelie. * Panorpa meridionales, Vernet. Hydropsyche pellu- 
cidula, Amelie [also from Bagnial-sur-Mer]. Philopotamus montanus, 
Amelie and Vernet. * Rhyacophila persimilis, Amelie. * LK. tristis, 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 259 


Vernet. Those with * are not British.—W. J. Lucas; Kingston-on- 
Thames. 


RaApPHIDIA MACULICOLLIS (NEUROPTERA).—In connection with my 
note on this snake-fly (antea, p. 129), I may note that I have 
received a pupa from Dr. David Sharp, which he took at Braemore 
in Scotland in June of the present year. This one is a female, and 
an interesting point about it is that its long ovipositor is folded back 
and lies closely pressed to the dorsal surface of the abdomen.—W. J. 
Lucas; Kingston-on-Thames. 


LoneEvity oF EPINEPHELE IANIRA.—I believe it is generally 
considered that the Satyridze are usually short-lived butterflies, there- 
fore it may be worth recording that a freshly emerged female H. canira 
I captured in coitw on July 2nd last lived in captivity until Aug. 28th, 
making fifty-eight 


Tar INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE Hatcuine or LEPIDOP- 
TEROUS Eaas.—As an example of the influence temperature has on 
the development and hatching of eggs of Lepidoptera, the following 
is a good instance. On May 30th last a Pveris brassice deposited a 
batch of forty-one eggs during warm weather, but on June 2nd the 
temperature suddenly fell many degrees, and cold, wet weather set 
in and continued so for the next fortnight ; consequently, the eggs did 
not hatch until June 16th, remaining in the egg state seventeen days. 
At mid-day on August 10th, during fine and very warm weather, I 
watched three P. brassice depositing; in all, five batches of eggs were 
laid. All these hatched on August 15th quite early in the morning, 
the egg state lasting only four and a half days, due to the weather 
remaining exceptionally warm throughout, thus making a difference 
of twelve and a half days in the time of hatching.—F. W. Fronawk. 


GyYNANDROUS ABRAXAS GROSSULARIATA ab. VARLEYATA.—Of the 
only two specimens of wild Abraxas varleyata I bred this year, the 
produce of seven hundred collected pupz, one has both the left-side 
wings male, 2. e. with the usual white rays characteristic of the sex, 
but the right-side wings female, 7.e. without white rays, as is usual 
in that sex. Apparently it is a gynandrous specimen.—Gro. T. 
Porritt, Elm Lea, Huddersfield, September Ath, 1909, 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


Sugar A Faure In JuNE AND Juty.— Mr. Everett (antea, 
p. 235) notes the scarcity of moths during the months of June 
and July in Cambs. My experience has been similar. I have 
“treacled”’ night after night without a single moth visiting the trees. 
This could hardly have been due to bad weather, as I caught a good 
number at ‘light’? in these months, and treacle paid well from the 
middle of August to the beginning of September (I took about fifty 
on twelve trees on August 26th), although the weather has been 
almost as bad as in June and July. I think that as flowers have 
been abundant this season, in spite of the bad weather, the moths 
may have found them more attractive than artificial sweets.—

260 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Notes rrom Stpmourn.—I was pleased when at Weston Beach, 
near Sidmouth, on August 4th last to see a few examples of that 
now very local butterfly Pararge egeria. Colias edusa was there, too, 
but not in any numbers. Adopea acteon occurred, but not at all 
freely, as can be judged from the fact that it took me two hours to 
get a dozen specimens, all of which were males, for the most part 
in only fair condition. Pyrausta punicealis was common amongst 
the thyme near the base of the cliffs —F. G. Wairre; 7, Marine 
Avenue, Southend, September 7th, 1909. 


ABRAXAS GROSSULARIATA ab. LACTICOLOR.—On July 29th I took 
a perfect specimen of A. grossulariata ab. lacticolor Raynor, as figured 
on plate 104 in ‘Moths of the British Isles’ (second series), and I 
thought this occurrence might be sufficiently interesting to report.— 
P. H. Harvey; 9, Church Street, Warwick, August 27th, 1909. 


Harty APPEARANCE OF TRIPHHNA PRONUBA. — Whilst sugaring 
on the 24th of April of this year for a female munda, although already 
rather late for that insect, I boxed a freshly emerged example of 
7’. pronuba. Is not this an exceptionally early date for this species ? 
Probably the mild spell in February may account for their early 
emergence.—R. T. Baumann; ‘“ Glendale,” 70, Station Road, Ching- 
ford, Essex. 


ABUNDANCE OF VANESSA 10.—The sudden appearance of Vanessa 
zo in such numbers as it is at the present time is, I think, worthy of 
record after so many years of comparative scarcity. In South-east 
Hissex it is in greater abundance than I have seen it since the 
“seventies.” I hear it is very common in many places, and it would 
be interesting to learn if it is equally abundant throughout the 
country.—F’. W. FrRoHAwkK. 


VANESSA ANTIOPA IN Kmnt.—Mr. Siegfried Sassoon captured a 
specimen of V. antiopa on September 3rd last behind a blind of a 
skylight in his house at Paddock Wood, Kent. It is in fair condition, 


with cream-coloured margins; the blue submarginal spots are smaller 
than usual—F. W. F. 


Nore on Nonaaria Geminipuncta.— While working for pupe of 
this species at Lewes on the 31st July last, I cut one reed con- 
taining no fewer than nine pupe. It is by no means uncommon to 
find two or three on one reed, but so large a number as nine is 
certainly more or less of a record. Can any of your correspondents 
go one better ?—-Huau J. VINALL; Torbay, Park Road, Lewes. 


SPILOSOMA LUBRICIPEDA var. ZATIMA IN WARWICKSHIRE.—About 
the middle of June last I had the good fortune to take, in the town 
street, a very nice specimen of the zatima form of S. lubricipeda. It 
was kept alive for a day or two in the hope of finding a typical female 
and so obtain a pairing if possible. In this, however, I was not 
successful.—cC. Baker; 25, Long Street, Atherstone. 


DaAPHNIS NERI IN DEVONSHIRE.—It may be of interest to record 
that a specimen of Daphnis nerit was caught at Ilfracombe on 
September 22nd. It was sitting on a fig-leaf in a garden there. 
When brought to me it was a little rubbed on thorax, and had one of 


SOCIETIES. 261 


the antenne damaged, but otherwise was a fine specimen.—H. §. 
Hepsert; Berrynarber S8.0., Devon, September 25th, 1909. 


Nore on EvurirHECIA ASSIMILATA.—A vigorous hop, said to be 
of the kind known as the ‘Kentish Golding,” was planted in the 
garden here about five years ago. ‘The main object in growing it 
was to obtain a sun screen for the wooden construction in which are 
housed various boxes, cages, &amp;c., used in rearing Lepidoptera. For 
this purpose it has proved very suitable, but since 1905 moths have 
found it a convenient shelter during the summer, and the larve of 
several species feed on the foliage; among the latter is Hupithecia 
assimilata, with which species the present note is more especially 
concerned. HH. assimilata was first observed in the garden on July 
1st, 1907, when a female specimen was noticed on the paling near 
which the hop grows. In 1908 a worn female was seen on the same 
fence in early June, and in July a few larve were found on the under 
sides of the hop-leaves. These produced moths the last week in July 
and early August. Over a score of larvae were collected from the hop 
in the autumn, but the pup died during the winter. No example 
of the first flight of moths was seen this year, but on August 3rd a fine 
male was taken off the fence, and a worn one was noted on the 12th 
of the same month. Between July 20th and September 4th the 
foliage of the hop had been examined from time to time, and on each 
occasion larvze were found. These were of all sizes, some being only 
in their first or second instar, whilst others were nearly full-grown. 
These various stages of growth were not only observed on the earliest 
date mentioned, but also on the later one. Between forty and fifty 
larve altogether were secured, and all the healthy ones have pupated ; 
a rather large proportion were parasitised. One moth emerged on 
August 22nd, on which date several larvee ranging in size from newly 
hatched to half growth were seen on the hop. 

Presumably the two moths referred to as found on the paling and 
also the one that emerged in confinement were of the second genera- 
tion—that is, descendants of parents that had wintered in the pupal 
state. It seems then that the first and second generations of larvee 
have this year overlapped, and that larve of the second generation have 
been in point of time somewhat earlier than usual. Perhaps delay 
in the emergence of moths from some of the wintered pup, due 
possibly to unfavourable weather conditions, may have contributed 
to the overlapping. On the other hand, it is probable that some 
moths of the second generation may have been on the wing earlier 
than August 3rd, even about mid-July, and these have been the 
parents of the very juvenile larve found with the almost mature ones 
on July 20th.—Ricuarp Soutu; 96, Drakefield Road, Upper Tooting, 
5.W., September 22nd, 1909.

RECENT LITERATURE. 


Catalogue of the Lepidoptera Phalene in the British Museum. 
Vol. viii. By Sir Georce F. Hampson, Bart. Pp. i-xiv, 
1-583. With Atlas of fourteen plates in colour. London: 
Printed by Order of the Trustees. 1909. 


As mentioned in our notice of vol. vii. of this important work, 
the author stated that the noctuid subfamily Acronyctine would 
occupy three volumes. In the volume now before us a further 
contingent of 723 species and 104 genera is comprised, thus bringing 
up the total number of species so far described in the subfamily to 
1563. It is expected that vol. ix., the last of the three dealing with 
the Acronyctinz will be published during the present year. 

There are 43 genera with only a single species assigned to each. 
Of the 15 new genera the largest is Omphaletis, Hamps. (t. florescens, 
Walk.), comprising 11 species from Australia and ethiopica, n. sp., 
from British East Africa. 

Over 120 species, chiefly North American, are here referred to 
Acronycta, Treit., and these are arranged in three sections as 
follows :— : 

Sect. 1. Hyboma, Hiibn. (t. strigosa, Schiff.) = Viminia, Chap. 
(type rwmicis, L.). 

Sect. 11. Triena, Hiibn. (t. psz, L.) = Cuspidia, Chap. (t. pst, L.). 

Sect. ui. Acronycta, Treit. = Acronicta, Ochs. (t. leporina, L.). 

The European species in Sect. ii. are tridens, Schiff.; cuspis, 
Hiibn.; aceris, L. (type of Arctomyscis, Hiibn., and of Apatela, Hiibn., 
Tent.) ; alu, L. (type of Jocheera, Hiibn.) ; auricoma, Schiff. (type 
of Pharetra, Hiibn.); menyanthidis, View.; megacephala, Schiff. ; 
and euphorbre, Schiff. The North American species cretata, Smith, 
with leporina, L., constitute Sect. iii. 

Another large genus is Athetis, Hiibn. (t. furvula, Hiibn., = lenta, 
Treit.). Among the 107 species embraced therein are ambigua, 
Schiff., alsines, Brahm., blanda, Schiff., clavipalpis, Scop., = quadri- 
punctata, Fabr., and morpheus, Hufn. 


264 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Hridania, Cram., is fixed as the type of Xylomyges, Guen., a 
genus with only four species, all of which are South American. 

The type of Petzlampa, Auriv., is minima, Haw.,= arcuosa, Haw., 
and Acosmetia morrisit, Morris, Naturl. ii. p. 88 (1837); Humphrey 
and Westwood, Brit. Moths, i. p. 245, pl. 54, fig. 12, is quoted in the 
synonymy. 

The 89 species under Monodes, Guen. (t. nucicolor, Guen.), are 
divided up, on antennal characters, into four sections, but as regards 
the first two and the last, only one species is assigned to each. All 
the others are included in Sect. iii, and are largely South American 
species ; venustula, Htibn., alone is European. 

‘““ Agriopis”’ viridis, Leech, is the type of Daseocheta, Warren 
(1907), and “ Diphtera” pallida, Moore, the type of Diphtherocome, 
Warren (1907). The latter is merged in the former, and the two 
species mentioned with twelve others, including alpiwm, Osbeck, = 
orion, Kisp., referred by authors to Diphthera, Hiibn., are here in- 
cluded in one or other of the five sections of Daseocheta. 

Gemella, Leech, originally described under Perigea, Guen., is the 
type of Dysmilichia, Speiser (1902); Phalacra, Staud. (1892), and 
Milichia, Sneller (1898), are both preoccupied names. _ 

The 448 excellent figures in the Atlas, drawn by Horace Knight, 
are capitally reproduced in chromo by West, Newman &amp; Co.

flies (Order Odonata). By Outver 8. THompson (New York 
State Museum, Bulletin 124, pp. 249-263). Albany. 1908. 

TuIs is a most useful paper on the unique structural arrange- 
ments for copulation in the Odonata. Forms of the appendages in 
the different divisions of the order are fully illustrated, but in some 
cases fuller references to the figures seem to be called for.

Lonainos Navas (Mem. de ‘x Real Acad. de Cien. y Artes de

An important paper of fifty-five pages, with two plates, devoted to 
this strange and not too well known group of the Neuroptera 
(restricted sense). They are a small group of insects near the 
Hemerobii, chiefly found in the Old World. The male possesses 
pectinated antennz, and the female has a long ovipositor.

SOME AUGUST BUTTERFLIES OF CANTAL AND 
LOZERE. 


By H. Rownanp-Brown, M.A., F.E.S. 


Sen on the map, the country to the south of Mont Doré, and 
especially that within the region of the mountains of Cantal, sug- 
gests tempting ground for entomologists who wish to add to 
their knowledge of the fauna of Central France—terra incognita, 
it seems, alike to French and British collectors. In bygone 
days one or two members of the Entomological Society of France 
appear to have given some attention to the butterflies of Cantal; 
and supplementary to Maurice Sand’s excellent Catalogue I find 
a list of captures made at le Lioran by M. Achille Guenée. 
With this slight material before me I had intended to visit 
the higher parts of the range in the early months of the 
summer, but again a variety of causes conspired to keep me in 
England until August was well in sight. The delay was doubly 
vexatious. It deprived me of the companionship of Mr. R. 8. 
Standen, one of the pioneers of Continental butterfly hunting. 
and also brought me to the appointed spot at a date when, as I 
was presently to discover, the better part of the local butterflies 
was over and done with. To stay more than a week in such a 
promising-looking locality as le Lioran and actually meet with 
no more than two members of the Lycenid family is an experi- 
ence without parallel in the several expeditions I have been 
fortunate enough to make abroad in previous years. But it is 
a fact that, apart from a single battered Lycena arion, T netted 
no other ‘‘ blue” there except Polyommatus alexis, and this very 
rarely. 

I travelled from Paris on the night of the 29th of July, and 
as I noticed on the return journey made by day, I had already 
passed through some fine scenery, when I awoke at Viescamp- 
sous-Jallés, the little junction where the main line to Figeac and 
Toulouse is crossed by the central road connecting Clermont- 
Ferrand and Bordeaux. Already the character of the country 


ENTOM.—NOVEMBER, 1909. Z

was indicated: the heavily cultivated meadows and pastures 
strewn with occasional volcanic boulders; and, as the train 
laboured slowly up the steep gradient from Aurillac, accidental 
rocks and green-shouldered hills dignified by the name of moun- 
tains—the craters and cones of long-dead volcanoes. The country 
round Vic-sur-Cére, the only intermediate place of any import- 
ance, offers some good collecting-ground, as I found when I paid 
a day’s visit there on August 4th; but the bad first fortnight of 
July which had brought such execrable weather even thus far 
south did not apparently affect the emergence of the local species, 
and, although Polygonia c-album and Pamphila sylvanus were still 
fresh, Satyrus circe was already passé, as well as most commoner 
things—Pararge mera, &amp;c. On the grassy slopes above the 
pretty village typical Melanargia galatea swarmed, and near a 
little spring, feeding quite a respectable cascade, I observed 
L. alcon, though never would the fast-flying males come within 
reach of the net. I mention these butterflies here because I did 
not meet with any of them except M. galatea higher up. 

Le Lioran (8780 ft.)—with its several ‘‘ Plombs,”’ and on the 
eastern declivity of the massive central group connecting 
Auvergne with Lozére—by situation and the altitude of its 
mountains running up to something over 6000 ft., had con- 
jured up visions of collecting by no means to be realized. I do 
not think I was ever in any. place presenting such attractive 
features, and so well adapted, climatically speaking, productive 
of poorer results in Lepidoptera; and Mr. Paulson, who was in 
the hotel collecting botanical specimens, informed me that the 
same state of things ruled among the flowers and plants, which 
disposed of the idea that the phenomenal first fortnight of 
July alone accounted for the dearth. Brooms of all kinds I 
regard with suspicion, where they flourish to the exclusion of 
other shrubs, for it is really surprising how very few butterflies 
appear to be attracted on the sunniest days and in the warmest 
localities even by the luscious scented golden blossoms of the 
larger species. Here the dwarf Genista sagittifera was ubiquitous 
in the pastures and upon the hill-footways of Upper Cantal, and 
appeared as distasteful to insects as to cattle. Otherwise the 
pleasant note of colour struck by the flowers of alpine meadows 
elsewhere was wanting; only the close-cropped green turf 
getting browner and more barren as it approached the summit 
of the mountains. 

My first day—in every respect an ideal day for collecting—I 
devoted to climbing the Plomb du Cantal, the highest peak, or 
rather cone, of the chain. The lower forests yielded practically 
nothing, except at one spot where a little spring had induced some 
growth of rank herbage. Here Melitea parthenie in twos and threes 
was flitting about, and occasional Chrysophanus virgauree, the 
males of which, now and thereafter, proved to be the commonest

species on the wing. A little further up, Hrebia stygne—the 
first Hrebia of the year for me—put in an appearance, and was 
almost common at about 5000 ft. The form differs materially 
from that of Digne and the Midi—it is much smaller, and, I 
think, blacker—more resembling examples from the Vosges in 
my collection, taken last year by Mr. Barraud and Mr. Gibbs 
(antea, p. 115, &amp;c.); the ocellations, moreover, are decidedly in-

ferior, often reduced to the merest pin-points. Flying with it was 
Erebia epiphron vay. cassiope, mostly of the form nelamus, Bsdv. ; 
but several females taken show a remarkable fine band on the 
fore wings, with large spots, which might be regarded as var. 
valesiana, M-D., after Mr. Wheeler’s description. But with these 
two butterflies, a single Hesperia serratule and a form of H. car- 
thami with very pale under side coloration, the catalogue for the 
day came to an end, save for an extremely battered Hipparchia 
semele circuiting the topmost Plomb, where the tremendous wind

collector. Disappointed on this the southern side of le Lioran, 
I next experimented on the north, under and upon the well- 
wooded slopes which lead to the grassy plateau beneath the cone 
of the Puy Mary (5860 ft.). Three days in all I spent upon 
this ground, but again results were discouraging. However, 
there were rather more butterflies on the wing here when the 
furious wind permitted them to fly, and on the first occasion 
I discovered Parnassius apollo by no means uncommon, though 
unfortunately I captured but a single example worth bringing 
home, and this save in so far that it is more heavily scaled than 
my typical Swiss specimens presents no special characters. 
Indeed, nothing in Cantal I met with could be described as 
approaching a distinctive form, all the common August butter- 
flies responding accurately to their typical representatives in the 
British Islands. 

The downward road to Murat suggesting possibilities, I took 
special pains to work upon the verdant banks now thick with 
full-flavoured wild strawberries. Hrebia ligea was not rare, and 
among the few things taken here I find a single example of 
E. euryale, while lower still I spent a fruitless hour endeavouring 
to stalk the apparently magnificent Apollos haunting the sides 
of a deep and almost inaccessible ravine. Later, a day spent at 
Murat produced nothing worth record, though it is mentioned 
by Sand as a locality for H. neoridas. Higher up C. virgauree 
was also generally common, and above the hotel one morning I 
took a single perfect example of C. alciphron var. gordius, save in 
smaller size presenting no superficial difference to the common 
form of the Midi. Rumicia phleas also was rare and ordinary in 
appearance. In the roadside pastures, however, M. galatea was 
very abundant, with the common Hesperids, Pamphila comma 
and Thymelicus lineola. My Cantal catalogue, therefore, remains 
wholly incomplete, but, as indicating more fully the species to be 
met with at le Lioran, I include in the following short list some 
observations (marked *) made by M. Achille Guenée and M. Sand, 
at a time when I expect the country was more open and wild, 
and the excellent cheese of the Department, therefore, a less 
conspicuous feature at tables d’hdte all over the central and 
southern regions :— 

Hesprripm®.—Carcharodus lavatere, Murat,* Hesperia car- 
thami, H. alveus, H. serratule, H. cacahe* (2?); Pamphila 
sylvanus, P. comma; Thymelicus lineola, T’.. acteon.

Alagnon, Murat.*

C. alciphron var. gordius, C. phleas; Lycena arcas, Murat,* 
L. euphemus,* L. alcon (Vic), L. arion; Cupido sebrus, Murat* ;

Saryrip#.—Satyrus circe (Vic); Hipparchia semele (one) ; 
Erebia epiphron var. cassiope, E. ceto, Murat* (rather doubtful, 
I should think, more likely to be H. medusa), HE. styyne, EH. eury- 
ale, E. ligea, E. ethiops,* E. neoridas, Murat.* 


With regard to some of the records, that of H. cacalie, re- 
ported from Murat, must be accepted with reservation. This 
‘‘ skipper ” is essentially alpine. Murat is but 3000 ft. above 
sea-level, and the nearest mountain of any altitude is the Puy 
Griou (5560 ft.). The two or three Pieris napi observed by me 
on the Plomb du Cantal were typical, but no doubt the form 
bryonie wight occasionally be developed here. 


(To be concluded.) 


LUPERINA NICKERLII, Freyver, AB. OR NEW 
SPECIES ? 


By RicuHarp SoutuH. 


Twenty years ago Mr. T. Baxter sent to me, for identification, 
a specimen of a Luperina that he had captured at St. Annes-on- 
Sea, Lancashire. 

After comparing the insect with some examples of L. nickerlit 
then in the collection of the late Mr. J. H. Leech, now in the 
National Collection, I concluded that the Lancashire specimen 
was a form connecting nickerlii with guencei, Doubleday, and 
that all were therefore forms of L. testacea (Entom. vol. xxii. 
p. 271). 

In 1891 Mr. Baxter obtained another specimen similar to the 
first but having an ochreous tinted pale greyish coloration, and 
this, I believe, was the type of L. testacea var. incerta, Tutt 
(Brit. Noct. vol. i. p. 140). 

During September last Mr. Baxter and a friend—Mr. W. 
- Gates—secured at least a dozen specimens. ‘Two males were 
submitted to Mr. F. N. Pierce, the well-known author of ‘ The 
Genitalia of the Noctuide,’ and he reports that the insects are 
certainly not referable to L. testacea. He is now most anxious 
to obtain one or two male specimens of nickerlii and also of 
gueneei. It is to be hoped that the necessary material will be 
available so that the question of variety or species may be de- 
finitely settled. 


270 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Gueneei is generally recognized as a form of L. testacea, but 
it might equally well be set down as a form of L. nickerliit. The 
Lancashire specimens, in fact, certainly seem to connect gueneet 
with nickerlii, and until it can be shown that these two can be 
separated one from the other, and from the Lancashire Luperina 
on structural differences in genitalia, I am inclined to accept all 
three as forms of one species. 

If it should subsequently be established that Mr. Baxter’s 
Luperina is specifically distinct from both nickerliit and gueneet, 
then it will have to be known as ZL. incerta, Tutt, and I propose 
to name the paler greyish specimens taken this year ab. bazteri. 

Some figures of the moths are being prepared, and these, 
together with drawings of Mr. Pierce’s preparations of the geni- 
talia, will be published in the ‘Entomologist ’ for December. 


THE ORDERS OF INSECTA. 
By D. SHarp, M.A., M.B., F.R.S., &amp;e. 


Tue question of the number of Orders that should be adopted 
in the Class Insecta has been much discussed, and a considerable 
- variety of views expressed about it. The subject has just been 
treated by Handlirsch in his great work on Fossil Insects, and 
it will no doubt be of interest to enumerate the Orders he adopts 
we existing insects. They amount to no fewer than thirty- 

Ve, viz. :— 


1. Arthropleona. 18. Mantoidea. 25. Plectoptera. 
2. Symphypleona. 14. Blattoidea. 26. Megaloptera. 
3. Dicellura. 15. Isoptera. 27. Raphidioidea. 
4, Rhabdura. 16. Corrodentia. 28. Neuroptera. 
5. Machiloidea. 17. Mallophaga. 29. Panorpate. 
6. Lepismoidea. 18. Siphunculata. 30. Phryganoidea. 
7. Gastrotheoidea. 19. Hymenoptera. 381. Lepidoptera. 
8. Orthoptera. 20. Coleoptera. 32. Diptera. 
9. Phasmoidea. 21. Strepsiptera. 33. Suctoria. 
10. Dermaptera. 22. Embioidea. 34. Hemiptera. 
11. Diploglossata. 23. Perlaria. 35. Homoptera. 


12. Thysanoptera. 24. Odonata. 


A few words of explanation and comment may be acceptable 
about this very formidable list. Nos. 1 and 2 are the two great 
divisions of the old Order Collembola; 8 and 4 are the Campodeid 
forms, Japyx, Campodea, &amp;e.; 5,6, and7 are divisions of Thysa- 
nura (7 being altogether doubtful), the old name Thysanura being 
still used by Handlirsch as that of a ‘Class’? composed of these 
three Orders; 8, Handlirsch limits the Orthoptera to the old 
Saltatoria, treating each of the other great divisions (viz. 9, 10, 
11, 13, and 14 of our list) as a separate Order, and interpolating 


THE ORDERS OF INSECTA. 971 


12, Thysanoptera, among them; 15, Isoptera or Termites; 16, 
Corrodentia limited to Psocide; 17 to 25 call for no remark ; 
96 consists of the forms allied to Sialis and Chauliodes ; 27 in- 
cludes only Raphidiide ; 28 consists of Hemerobiid forms; of 
29-35 it is only necessary to remark that the name Suctoria is 
applied to the fleas. 

For Handlirsch’s purposes it was desirable to adopt more 
Orders than are perhaps really necessary from the morphological 
and developmental points of view, and I think the following list 
may be considered sufficiently ample at the present day, viz. :—

272, THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


In view of the great advantage of having a uniform system of 
terminations, I have added in this list certain alternative names 
in brackets. They are mostly those proposed by Prof. Shipley 
in Zool. Anz. xxvii. 1904, and made use of in Prof. Sedewick’s 
recent ‘ Text-book of Zoology,’ vol. iii. 1909. 


A NEW SPECIES OF MORPHOTENARIS FROM 
DUTCH NEW GUINEA. 


By Preroy. I. Latuy, F.Z.S:, F.E.S. 


Morphotenaris adamsi, sp. nov. 

3. Upper side. Fore wing pearly white; a wide curved fascia 
from base to inner angle, the part within cell being blackish brown 
and beyond cell orange-brown. Hind wings pearly white, with tuft 
of brown hairs near base and below cell. Under side. Fore wing as 
above, but fascia darker in colour, and above fascia three submarginal 
white-centred black spots. Hind wing white, tinted with ochreous, 
particularly along costa and inner margin, a series of five sub- 
marginal ocelli, of which the upper is the largest and the next two 
smaller than the two lower ones; these ocelli are ochreous, faintly 
ringed with black, and contain a white-centred black spot. 

?. Similar to g¢ but larger, the orange-brown of fascia more 
suffused with black, and no tuft of hair on hind wings. Exp. 
36 110mm. 2? 128 mm. 

Hab. Ninay Valley, Dutch New Guinea. 

This fine new species was captured by Mr. A. E. Pratt, 
during the months of November and December, 1908, and 
January, 1909, at an elevation of 8500 ft. Mr. Adams’ series 
consists of one male and eight females. 

The nearest ally is M. schonbergi, Fruhst., from which it 
may easily be distinguished by parti-coloured fascia, the black 
spots on fore wings below, and smaller ocelli of hind wings 
below. 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 
By W. G. SuHeupon, F.E.S. 


(Continued from p. 251.) 


On June 14th we entrained for Herculesbad. I had been 
told by Budapest entomologists that the season in Hungary was 
a bad one, but not until Herculesbad was reached did I realise 
how bad it was, for there, in my judgment, not more than 
twenty-five per cent. of the specimens I ought to have met with 
were seen—a calculation made by comparing the results of 
those British lepidopterists who had preceded me with my own. 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 273 


I should strongly recommend anyone working Herculesbad to 
secure at the outset a very good map of the district, which can 
be purchased at the Bazaar for two krones = 1s. 8d., and which 
shows the position of the various localities well known to lepi- 
dopterists, but otherwise difficult to determine. 

We spent several days collecting by the road (above Hercu- 
lesbad) which traverses the Cserna valley. Here Neptis aceris 
was common, but worn; which was only natural, for Dr. Fischer, 
whom we met and who kindly gave us the benefit of his experience 
at Herculesbad, informed me that the first brood is often out by 
the end of April, and I understood that to get it in perfect 
condition one ought to be in its locality not later than the 
middle of May. Here, also, were Brenthis daphne in plenty— 
with Melitea athalia and var. mehadensis the most abundant 
butterflies. Lycena arion, a small obscure form, occurred in a 
dingle where a stream crossed under the road just beyond a hot 
sulphur spring, where also Hveres argiades var. coretas was not 
infrequent, and a solitary example of Brenthis hecate was netted, 
the only one seen in the district. A clearing on the left side of 
the road, just before we reached the dingle, was gay with 
flowers and large numbers of Lepidoptera, including several 
examples of Carcharodus althee, a species that has always been 
rare with me, and one or two C. alce@; a fine form of Chryso- 
phanus virgauree occurred, and plenty of Thecla acacia, T’. ilicis, 
and 7’. w-album; near this spot, too, Chrysophanus alciphron was 
common. On comparing my specimens of this species from the 
three localities in which they were taken, I found a rather 
striking difference between them. ‘Those from Pészer -are the 
most extreme of the three, with the strongest purple tinge and 
the least indication of copper in both sexes; those from Hercu- 
lesbad had the purple less strongly developed, with a much 
larger amount of copper; and one example that I saw some 
2000 ft. above Herculesbad, but did not capture, struck me as 
very little darker than some Swiss C. var. gordius that I have 
seen ; the Szada specimens are intermediate between those from 
the other two localities. 

A couple of Limenitis popult var. tremule were taken at rest 
on the road near the town; and two or three Apatura ilia var. 
clytie were observed in the same place. Mr. Tylecote the day 
before he left for England (June 22nd) captured on the road, 
about a mile above Herculesbad, a fine Hugonia xanthomelas, the 
only example either of us came across, though Dr. Fischer 
informed me that a Hungarian lepidopterist, a few days before 
our advent at Herculesbad, had taken several. 

A fine brood of Polyommatus orion var. ornata was abundant, 
generally extending as high as the Quelle. Amongst the species 
not usually recorded from Herculesbad was a specimen of 
Chrysophanus thersamon, taken on June 29th in good condition 


274 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


in one of the meadows on the Coronini hill; probably one of a 
second brood. 

Pieris napi var. nap~e was abundant everywhere, especially 
in the ravine leading up to the Quelle; the examples were large, 
many of them having an expanse of 55 mm., whilst one expands 
57 mm., and the females were heavily spotted. From ova 
deposited by captured females I reared a few examples after 
my return home; these were var. napee of course, and closely 
resembled their parents. At the higher levels on the first few 
days of my visit I came across a few typical specimens ; evidently 
these belonged to an earlier brood; they were not in good 
condition. 

Pieris rape was equally abundant with its relative, but did 
not, within my observation, extend much above the valley. The 
form was a very handsome one, with pronounced black tips to 
the front wings, brilliant canary under sides to hind wings, and 
heavily spotted females. 

I spent the morning of June 17th on the Coronini hill, but 
did not add much to my knowledge or collecting-boxes, for the 
day was unfavourable and the grass in the meadow had been 
cut. Doubtless earlier in the summer the hill is more prolific. 

I was told at Budapest that J’hais polyxena did not occur at 
Herculesbad, and was therefore surprised to find that the larvee 
were quite abundant on the banks of the Cserna just below the 
town. A species I much wanted was the elusive Libythea celtis, 
which almost eluded me, for although several specimens were 
seen near the town on June 21st, and one was netted, they dis- 
appeared from there mysteriously the next day, and except for 
one taken at the Domogled Quelle on June 22nd I did not see 
another example. Lvidently there was an emergence about 
June 20th, the specimens of which seem to have migrated to 
another locality a day or two afterwards. 

After June 21st all the better insects deserted the roads, and 
I had no option but to work the higher ground. The best collect- 
ing at Herculesbad seems to be centred upon the slopes of the 
Domogled, a mountain which lies south-east of the town, and 
rises to some 38000 ft. above it. Mr. Jones in 1907 having 
made a very successful ascent of this mountain under the 
auspices of a local guide, Nicholas Kolopenza, I thought I could 
not do better for a start than to send for him, and stipulate 
that I should go up the mountain by the road Mr. Jones had 
patronized. Iam afraid, however, something went wrong, for 1 
was taken down the road leading to the station for a mile or so 
until we got to a place where some mining operations were going 
on; here we assaulted the mountain from the south-west, a very 
steep, dry, hot route, on which I did not see a single butter- 
fly I wanted, and by the time the summit was reached I had had 
enough of it. After my experience I should advise anyone work- 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. O75 


ing the Domogled to steadfastly refuse to go up by any other 
way than that past the Weisses Kreuze ; the path by this route 
is good, the slopes are easy, one is in shade practically all the 
way, and, best of all, the butterflies that affect the mountain are 
there found most abundantly. 

My chief object in working the Domogled was to obtain a 
good series of Neptis lucilla, which is usually abundant there, 
though rare in the Cserna valley; judging by Mr. Jones’s 
experience I ought to have obtained my object in one journey ; 
I did certainly eventually obtain about two dozen fine examples, 
but I made eight ascents for them, during which I calculate 
I climbed not less than 18,000 ft. I suppose the books are right 
in giving the food-plant of this species as Spirea salicifolia, and 
that of N. aceris as Orobus vernus, but I could not see any- 
where at Herculesbad a plant that I should consider a Spirea, 
nor did I ever see a specimen of Neptis aceris near a plant of 
Orobus vernus, which was abundant in certain places there. 
The habits and haunts of both these butterflies are similar, 
except that Neptis aceris rarely rises much above the Cserna 
valley, whilst N. lucilla is scarce until one gets up at least 
1000 ft. Both seem to delight in small clearings in the forest, 
and if one of these is found overgrown with Clematis vitalba or 
bramble, one or two specimens of a Neptis is pretty sure to be 
there sailing slowly round the bushes on motionless wings, 
except for an occasional flap to give impetus, and from time 
to time settling upon some spray or approaching the resting 
place of another specimen, which will thereupon rise and toy or 
fight with the intruder, both soaring to a considerable height, 
then separating, and each proceeding on its way, which did not 
usually take it out of the clearing. Both species not infrequently 
settle on the ground in dry weather, probably for the sake of 
moisture they find there. The flight being so slow would lead 
one to suppose they are easy to capture; this is not so, how- 
ever; the very slowness of the motion leading one to strike in 
advance, and at Neptis lucilla especially I missed quite a number 
of apparently ludicrously easy shots. 

Beyond N. lucilla I did not see much of note on the Domogled ; 
most of the species previously noted in the Cserna valley were 
there in some numbers, and on the peak itself Hrebia medusa 
var. psodea was not infrequent, the males in bad order, the 
females fairly fresh; this species was not confined to the peak, 
one example being netted by Mr. Tylecote a few hundred feet 
above Herculesbad, whilst I found two or three in an alpine 
meadow on the way up the mountain at an altitude of about 
2000 ft. On the peak Melitea trivia was fairly common, and 
still in good condition on June 21st. The Quelle clearing, 
where in most years good insects usually swarm, was an extra- 
ordinary failure, and beyond a few M. maturna, one example of 


276 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Libythea celtis, and two Neptis lucilla I saw there absolutely 
nothing I cared to net. 

One of the chief entomological lions of Herculesbad is of course 
Pararge roxelana, which is hardly known to occur elsewhere in 
Europe outside the Balkans. This fine species is found in most 
of the woods, possibly in all of them, up to six or seven hundred 
feet above the river, but the best locality is said to be the wood 
in which is the path leading up to the Weisses Kreuze. At 
Herculesbad it is essentially a wood frequenter, seldom being 
seen in the open. ‘The ground is exceptionally difficult to work, 
for it slopes up at an angle of from 50° to 60°, and following a 
lively butterfly, which P. roxelana is, under those conditions is 
absurd; one’s only possible plan therefore is to. try to find 
a level spot in his haunts, and to endeavour to net him as he 
passes it. Such an opportunity is offered by the path leading 
up to the Weisses Kreuze. The orthodox manner of catching 
P. roxelana, I was told, is to watch until he settles on a 
tree-trunk, and then to cautiously put your net over him, 
holding the end of the bag in the left hand to enable him to fly 
into it, when of course the rest is easy to perform. ‘This is 
admirable in theory, and possibly under certain conditions, 
such as large trees and small nets, it might act; but I tried 
it on half a dozen occasions, and missed as many butterflies. 
The large trees in the Kreuze wood are mixed with a great 
number of small ones, and P. roxelana would invariably insist 
upon resting upon these latter, with the result that when I had 
succeeded in covering the front door with the net the intended 
victim just quietly slipped out by the back. There are, however, 
certain conditions under which P. roxelana is as tame and stupid 
as a barndoor fowl, though he is usually as lively and wild as a 
March hare. On a certain day I was descending from the 
Domogled towards noon, and whilst in the higher part of the 
Kreuze wood was overtaken by a terrific hailstorm, during which 
IT obtained what shelter I could from a bush and a bicycle cape. 
Whilst the storm was at its height to my amazement a magnifi- 
cent P. roxelana fluttered down from somewhere, and settled on 
the ground within a yard of me. I made no mistake with him!

Leucaspis pinifolie. 


24. Chionaspis furfurus, Fitch.* 
Ablerus clisiocampe, Ashm., originally bred from Bombyces, 
is said to prey upon this species by Howard (Revis. p. 42).

30. Myrimaspis. 
From an unnamed species of this genus on Salix Howard 
records (Revis. p. 26) Aphelinus abnormis, and from another 
specimen of the same genus (/.c.) his A. diaspidis was bred. 


31. Mytilaspis pomorum, Bché. 

Several parasites have been described from this destructive 
species in America: Aphelinus abnormis (How., Revis. p. 26), 
A. fuscipennis (l. ¢c. p. 27), A. mytaspidis (l.¢. p. 25), Chiloneurus

from it by Howard (Revis. p. 27). 


33. Mytilaspis beckii, Newm.* 

From Aspidiotus citricola, Pack., Ashmead (‘Orange Insects,’

his Prospalta auranti is given by Howard (Reyvis. p. 41) from North 
America. 

35. Mytilaspis eucalypti, Crawf.* 

This species is attacked in Australia by the same parasite as 
the last. 

36. Hriopeltes lichtensteinit, Sign.* 

Gaulle (Cat. 99) gives this species, under the genus Hriophorus, 
as destroyed by Sceptrophorus cyanifrons, Dalm., in France. 


37. Hriopeltes festuce, Fonse. 

The same author brings forward (p. 106) Aphelinus abdomi- 
nalis, Dalm. (nee Nees) as a parasite of Coccus festuce, but later 
(p.97) simply instances Hetroma rufum, Dalm. (lindus, Walk.) 
and Beocharis pascuorum, Mayr., as attacking Coccids on grasses. 


38. CEROPLASTES. 
Unspecified members of this genus are said by Ashmead to 
be attacked by Asteropeus primus, How., in Mexico (p. 405), and 
Aphycus mexicanus, How. (p. 887 et Revis. Aphel. 1895, p. 22). 


39. Ceroplastes rusci, Linn.*

I Have received some specimens of this species (identified for 
me by Mr. G. J. Arrow) from Mr. Kenneth J. Cameron, which is

a pest to cotton near Zomba, Nyasaland. Mr. Cameron, writing 
under date of August 24nd, 1909, says:—‘‘ Fully a month ago I 
found what I considered to be a small weevil crawling along a 
cotton plant. I found them in the stem just on the point of 
emerging, but not until a week ago had I time to collect sufficient 
specimens to send you. ‘These weevils do most damage just 
where the cotton-stem enters the soil, but I find they are also in 
the joint of stem and branches, or what was at one time a branch 
bud. I am afraid this plague is more serious than I at first 
anticipated. It may be a difficult matter to keep a cotton planta- 
tion clear of them.” Mr. Cameron also sent me a piece of 
cotton-stem showing holes made by the weevil when emerging 
from cell, and another ‘‘ with insect formation or cell, like that 
on beans.” 
Alcides arcuatus, Boh., var. 


This beetle (identified for me by Mr. Guy Marshall) was also 
received from Mr.Cameron. Heinforms me :—“ For some years 
back I am aware that a beetle lays its eggs in bean-stems when 
the bean is only a few weeks old. The larve from these eggs live 
on or consume the bean-stem, and thus reduce the crop con- 
siderably. At times, with the cutting up of this beetle to lay its 
egos, the stems become broken down; at other times the larve 
to the number of ten, sometimes even twelve, develop in the 
stem without much apparent notice, unless attention is directed 
to it. About the time the beans are fully ripe the larve have 
assumed the perfect condition, but can easily be destroyed before 
that time. However, the cultivation of beans in this country, 
so far, is of little importance.”

NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 


British CAaraBip#.—I am making an inquiry as to the variation 
of the wings in Carabide, and so far as I have gone at present the 
results are promising to be of interest. But I cannot hope to make 
it satisfactory without the assistance of other entomologists, and I 
shall be greatly obliged if anyone will send me fresh specimens. I 
prefer them unmounted, and they should not be kept long in laurel. 
One of the points is whether there is local variation. Specimens of 
species, even the commoner, from out-of-the-way localities would be 
very acceptable. Specially glad should I be to receive localised 
species, which we may presume to be isolated from other colonies of 
the same species.—D. SHarp; Brockenhurst, October 11th, 1909. 


ACIDALIA DEGENERARIA IN DEvoNSHIRE.—Last year Mr. J. Walker, 
of Torquay, was good enough to send me a pair of A. degeneraria that 
he had reared, with others, from eggs laid by a female moth captured 
in the Torquay district. Just recently he forwarded two other speci- 
mens that he had netted during the present year; these are a trifle 
larger but not so good in condition as the bred examples. Mr. Walker 
states that he first met with the species in 1897, but did not see it 
again until 1904. ‘Since 1904,” he writes, ““I have taken and bred 
them from wild females every year.’’ He considers that A. degene- 
rarva in Devon is of a different form to that occurring in Portland, 
and thinks that it should have a varietal name. Except that the 
purplish bands are dusky rather than reddish tinged, I do not find 
any particular difference between Torquay specimens and examples 
of a second generation from Portland parents, reared in September, 
1904, by Mr. Hyde, of Weymouth.—RicHArp Sours. 


ZEPHYRUS BETULH, ab.—I should like to record the following :— 
From some larve of Z. betule obtained last June near Peterborough 
I have bred a female imago which has an orange band along the 
entire costal margin, tapering to a point at the tip of the wing, and 
reaching in width to the orange blotch in the middle of the wing. 
The hind wings are rather thickly sprinkled with orange, and the 
specimen is somewhat small, about the size of the male.—J. B. 
Morris; 14, Ranelagh Avenue, Barnes, October 14th, 1909. 


THE GeneRIc NAME LomocrapHa.—There is a serious discrepancy 
in the usage of the name Lomographa, Hiibner (‘ Verzeichniss,’ 
p- 311) by our leading workers. It was originally a mixed genus, 
consisting of bimaculata, Fab. = taminaria, Hib., trimaculata, Vill. 
= permutaria, Hib., and levigata, Scop. = renularia et levigaria, 
Hiib., and was allowed to lie dormant until Meyrick (Trans. Ent. Soe. 
Lond. 1892, p. 110) resuscitated it for tremaculata and its congeners, 
removing the other two. Thus trimaculata ought to be the type of 
the genus, and I beg to “select ”’ it as such, in accordance with the 
requirements of the International Code, unless this be considered to 
have been done already by Meyrick. Warren has been using the 
name erroneously in place of Bapta, Steph., and has a note in Noy. 
Zool. vi. p. 842; he ignores Meyrick’s first work (published March, 
1892), though referring to a later one (June, 1892), and his suggestion 
that bimaculata is “the proper type of Lomographa”’ is untenable. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. 981 


He does not seem to “select a type,’’ but merely bases his assumption 
on a mechanical rule of “first species = type,” which has no force ; 
Grote’s citation of temerata as type (Allg. Zeit. Ent. vii. p. 471, 1902) 
is of course ultra vires, and Meyrick’s usage has seven years’ priority 
over Warren’s and ten over Grote’s. The correct synonomy is :—(1) 
Bapta, Steph. (1831) = Corycia, Dup. (1829, nom. preeoce.) = Lomo- 
grapha, Warr., Grote (nec Hiib., Meyr. restr.), type b¢maculata, Fab. 
(2) Lomographa, Hib. (1826 ?, Meyr. restr.) = Stegania, Guen. = 
Terpnomicta, Led., type trimaculata, Vill. — Louis B. Prout; 246, 
Richmond Road, N.E., October 13th, 1909. 


Tue Foop-Prant or Lyc#NA PHERETES.—I have been reading in 
the ‘Entomologist’ (antea, p. 221) of Dr. Chapman’s interesting dis- 
covery that Soldanella alpina is the food-plant of Lycena orbitulus. 
I feel that I should put on record that on July 15th of last year 
(1908), in the Roseg Thal, Ober-Engadin, I found LZ. pheretes in 
considerable numbers on a very limited area of ground, and always 
associated with Astragalus alpinus, L. (Phaca astragalina, DC.). It 
was a damp dull day, and late in the afternoon, and I did not see the 
females laying on the plant while at large; but several females, which 
I easily boxed, when in captivity afterwards laid very freely on sprays 
of the plant, while only one ovum was placed upon a piece of Lotus 
corniculatus which I offered them in addition. The larve fed freely 
on some Astragalus which I brought home, but I was unwisely 
tempted to try to rear too many for the plants, and when the latter were 
eaten I could find no allied plant, either in my own rock-garden nor 
in several of our English nurseries, that would satisfy them, and one by 
one the larvee disappeared—hybernated, as I hoped. But none showed 
when spring came round, and I think they perished before they were 
ready to go into winter quarters. When I saw them last some of the 
larve were in their third stage; they closely resembled the pale green 
hairy pinnas of the Astragalus foliage. This fact, coupled with their un- 
willingness to take to any of the several other dwarf plants of the family 
which I offered them, justifies me, I think, in assuming that this is the 
food-plant of ZL. pheretes.—W. H. Sr. Quintin ; Scampston, York. 


CUCULLIA UMBRATICA, A FmeRTILIZER OF ORCHIS MACULATA.—At 
Onich, Inverness-shire, in August, I found at rest on a post a speci- 
men of the above moth with one of the pollen masses of the orchid 
named attached to the head just above the eye. The observation is 
of interest, since the chief authority on this subject, Hermann Miller, 
gives no lepidopterous visitors for the orchid in his ‘ Fertilization of 
Flowers’ (1883). C. Darwin records as insect visitors Cerambycide 
and humble-bees, and Empide (George Darwin). Muller says the 
flower is chiefly visited by Diptera. The only orchid in flower at the 
time of the observation was O. maculata, which was quite common in 
the district. A comparison of the pollen mass on the moth with some 
extracted from the flowers proved their identity. My earliest recol- 
lection of C. wmbratica as a flower-frequenting species was during the 
summer of 1868, when I first commenced collecting. The moth was 
seen every evening in abundance over the honeysuckle growing in 
our garden at Leyton, in Essex.—R. Metpoua ; 6, Brunswick Square, 
W.C., October 16th, 1909.

CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


EXTRAORDINARY ABUNDANCE OF, AND DESTRUCTION BY, THE 
Larv# oF PIERIS BRASSIC#.—One noticeable entomological feature 
of the past autumn has been the extraordinary abundance of the 
larve otf Pieris brassice, which have done an immense amount of 
injury to cabbage and other cultivated plants of the Brassica genus 
in fields and gardens. A farmer told me of an instance where six 
acres of kale were completely destroyed by these caterpillars; every 
leaf had been devoured, the stalks alone remaining, which presented 
a curious and melancholy spectacle. The larve have committed 
great havoc with the cabbages in our own gardens.—JOSEPH ANDER- 
son; Chichester. 


Larva or Manpuca atropos AT CHICHESTER.—A larva of Man- 
duca atropos just on the point of pupating was brought to me on 
September 16th. It was dug up with potatoes. The interference 
was probably inopportune, and resulted in death before the last 
ecdysis. This is the only instance of the occurrence of Manduca 
atropos in any stage known to me this year in this locality.—_Josmpa 
ANDERSON; Chichester. 


APATURA IRIS AND VANESSA ANTIOPA IN Essex.—A female speci- 
men of Apatura iris was seen in this neighbourhood this summer by 
a young collector, Mr. Webster. It had settled on the ground but a 
short distance from him. As there is a good deal of oak and some 
sallow in the vicinity, it is quite possible that this was a wild in- 
dividual. Mr. P. I. Lathy informs me that he saw a specimen of 
Vanessa antiopa at Broxbourne. Another individual of this species 
was observed within the precincts of the Royal Small Arms Factory 
at Enfield.—GrorcE Tausot; 11, Palace Gardens, Enfield. 


A Few Insects From BrarmMAar.—Dr. D. Sharp was kind enough 
to give me a few insects which he took at Braemar in June of this 
year. They were :—Neuroptera: Raphidia maculicollis, two males 
and two females, together with a female pupa. Plecoptera: Dzcty- 
opteryx mortont, five males and a female; Dictyopterygella recta, a 
nymph almost certainly, and three imagines ; Chloroperla grammatica, 
one; Teniopteryx risi, two; Nemoura variegata, a male and a female. 
Trichoptera: Brachycentrus subnubilus, two.—W. J. Lucas. 


Notes ON THE SEAson.—I was able to spend the morning of 
Saturday, August 7th last, one of the few really favourable collecting 
days in the past season, in Folkestone Warren. Peronea aspersana 
was flying among the Poteriwm; Pyrausta anguinalis, Coleophora 
lixella, Lozopera dilucidana, fi. francillana, and other species were 
about. I think I saw more insects on this particular morning than I 
had seen during a whole fortnight spent in Lincolnshire in the middle 
of July, when the only interesting Lepidoptera noticed were Tapino- 
stola elynv, at Mablethorpe, and a few Scoparia ulmella, near Wil- 
loughby.—F’. G. Wurrrte ; 7, Marine Avenue, Southend, October 9th. 


ABUNDANCE OF VANESSA 10.—In July, along the roads around 
Sidmouth, the larve of this insect were abundant on the nettles. I 
could have taken hundreds.—A. H. G. NETHERCOT. 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 983 


ENNOMOS AUTUMNARIA AT RAamsGATE.—Seeing that this insect is 
far from common in a wild state in Britain, I thought it would be 
interesting to note that ten specimens have been taken at light 
between September 23rd and October 2nd. —N. C. E. Minurr; 66, 
Ellington Road, Ramsgate. 


ACRONYCTA ALNI AND CIRRH@DIA XERAMPELINA NEAR SHREWS- 
BuRY.—I have to record the occurrence, in the middle of August last, 
of two larvee of Acronycta alni, one found by myself in my garden at 
Meole Brace, the other by Mr. H. EH. Forrest at Bayston Hill, about 
a mile distant, in both instances feeding on roses. Also at light, on 
the evening of September 5th, a fine but rather pale variety of C. 
xerampelina. Both species are mentioned in Mr. Newnham’s Cata- 
logue of Church Stretton Lepidoptera, but, so far as I can gather, 
neither have been yet noticed so near the town of Shrewsbury. I 
may add that both larve of A. alnz pupated healthily a few days after 
they were found.—J. Cosmo Mrtvinn; Meole Brace Hall, Shrews- 
bury, October 15th, 1909. 


ABRAXAS GROSSULARIATA ab. LACTICOLOR.—A female specimen of 
this insect was taken on July 30th of this year by S. Carlier in 
Gladstone Road, Dorridge, being the third specimen recorded for 
Warwickshire in 1909.—E. Wack Cartier. 


PuRYXUS (DEILEPHILA) LIVORNICA AT BLAcKPooL.—A very fine 
specimen of Deilephila livornica was brought me yesterday by a 
friend of mine; it was taken by a man who was playing bowls at the 
No. 3 Hotel, Blackpool, who picked it up on the green there, and it 
was alive when it reached me in a tumbler tied over with paper.— 
T. H. SHEPHERD; 17, Slope View, Carr Lane, Shipley, Yorks, Oct. 19th. 


Sucar A Faure, JuNE AND Juty.— My experience has been 
somewhat similar to that of Mr. Jones (antea, p. 259), with perhaps 
the exception of June. In that month, up to the 21st, I found moths 
came freely to sugar. At the same time some of the oak and ash 
trees were absolutely bare of leaves. The first half of July I spent at 
Sidmouth, but neither on the hills nor in the woodg a few miles 
inland would sugar attract. On my return home the same fate befell 
me, and it was not until August 27th that I took any moths at sugar ; 
even then they were quite common sorts and few in numbers, although 
on August 10th moths were attracted to light in profusion, and a 
large quantity were boxed off the window fronts. Since the middle 
of September the weather has been so bad that collecting had to be 
abandoned. I do not think the reason suggested is the correct one, 
inasmuch as the flowers at Sidmouth and Swindon have not been so 
abundant as in other years, when better luck attended one’s efforts. 
I may mention, too, that at Harpford Woods, where in 1908 Argynnis 
paphia, Melanargia galatea, Epinephele vanira, E. tithonus, Aphan- 
topus hyperanthus, Adopea linea, and Augiades comma swarmed, I 
only saw during this summer one Pararge egeria and a few H. ianira.

October 15th, 1909. 


Notes From INVERNESS-SHIRE, 1909.— During the month of 
August collecting was carried on at Onich in the above county, and 


984 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


as this district appears to have been very little investigated from the 
entomological point of view the following notes may be of interest :— 

In the way of captures the most noteworthy species were: P. in- 
terrogatioms, N. castanea, N. glareosa, EL. lutulenta (a melanic form), 
and S.anomala. N. ditrapezium, taken at light, adds another Scottish 
locality for this species. In addition to the common and widely 
occurring Geometers, the following were taken: D. obfuscaria, 
L. salicata, Eup. expallidata, EH. castigata, E. nanata, and E. cen- 
taureata (oblongata). As Vanessa atalanta was so abundant last 
autumn in the southern counties, it may be recorded that this 
butterfly was also common in the north this year, every nettle-bed 
examined furnishing the larva of this species and of V. wrtice in 
profusion. Special attention was paid to the bog-myrtle, which 
grows abundantly in all the marshy hollows in the moorland districts 
about Onich. The first point noted was that the larva of Hadena 
pist prefers this plant to broom. The latter also grows luxuriantly 
on the drier parts of the moors, but no H. pis? larvae were ever seen 
or beaten from it; they were quite common on Myrica on which 
they fed freely in confinement in preference to broom supplied at the 
same time.. The larva of A. menyanthidis occurred also commonly, 
and a number fed upon Myrica have now pupated in the breeding- 
cage. The larva of M. hastata occurred sparingly, and generally 
ichneumoned. On the same plant the larva of P. lipsiana was 
abundant, but the majority were ichneumoned, and a small percen- 
tage only emerged as imagos in September and October. The food- 
plant of this species is generally stated to be Vacciniwm. With respect 
to Tortrices the occurrence of G. negromaculana may be recorded, 
and the list of food-plants of P. sponsana extended. Although birch, 
oak, hornbeam, and mountain ash have been mentioned, the last- 
named species of Peronea is generally stated to feed upon beech, but 
pup found between the spun-up leaves of sallow and of sycamore 
also yielded this moth. The leaves of one particular sycamore tree 
were quite riddled by these larvee, a large percentage of which proved 
to be ichneumoned.—R. Mernpoua; 6, Brunswick Square, October 
12th, 1909. 


HUNTINGDONSHIRE DraGonrulEs, 1909.—My visits to Hunting- 
donshire this summer afforded very few opportunities for collecting, 
in consequence of the persistence of dull and rainy weather. I was 
fortunate enough, however, to make acquaintance with Libellula 
fulva as a living insect. This was the only Anisopterid species met 
with, and a few specimens were seen, including a pair 7m cop., flying 
over the River Ouse at Hartford; but they were extremely active, 
and two or three days were consumed in their pursuit before a 
specimen could be secured (July 2nd). It was a fully matured male, 
having the abdomen wholly blue; the eyes were slaty-blue above, 
with a greenish tinge below. The only previous record which I can 
find of the occurrence of this species in the county is that given in 
Stephens’s ‘Ill. Brit. Ent.’ (VI. Mand. p. 93, 1836), where L. bimacu- 
lata (= L. fulva) is stated to have been ‘taken in the neighbourhood 
of Whittlesea Mere in June.” &lt;A few pairs of Lestes dryas were again 
obtained from ditches near Ramsey (June 28th), but they were in an 
immature state. The pterostigmata, which in the adults are blackish, 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 285 


were in the earliest stages yellowish, and none of the males had 
developed the pruinose condition proper to the sex. The eyes of 
fully matured males are remarkable for their exquisite blue coloration, 
but the eyes of the examples taken this year were, alike in both sexes, 
chestnut-brown. L. sponsa was apparently not yet on the wing. 
The following Agrionids were also collected (June 23rd to July 2nd) :— 
Calopteryx splendens (in fine condition and unusually common, Hart- 
ford); Hrythromma naias (one female, Hartford); Ischnura elegans 
(abundant, Hartford and Ramsey) with its female forms rufescens 
and wnfuscans ; Agrion puella (not common, Hartford and Ramsey) ; 
and A. pulchellum (common, Hartford and Ramsey). A female of 
C. splendens (July 2nd) was exceptionally large, measuring 47 mm. 
in length and 69 mm. in alar expanse.—F. W. Campion; 33, Maude 
Terrace, Walthamstow, October 2nd, 1909. 


LEPIDOPTERA FROM THE ISLE OF ANGLESEY.—I understand that 
very little is known of the Lepidoptera of Anglesey, and hope that 
the following notes on collecting done on the north side of the 
island during the months of April, August, and September may be 
of interest. 

Taking the butterflies first, it may be noted that P. brassice and 
P. napi are common everywhere, while P. rap@ is not so frequently 
found. Specimens of H. cardamines and C. edusa have been seen, 
and some seasons P. cardwi and P. atalanta are common. V. urtic@ 
is always abundant, while V. zo is only occasionally taken. The 
Fritillaries are represented so far by single specimens of A. paphia, 
A. aglaia, and A. adippe. On the moors and heaths S. semele is 
abundant, while P. megera, E. janira, LE. tithonus, and C. pamphilus 
are to be found everywhere. C. phleas, L. astrarche, L. icarus, and 
A. sylvanus are also obtained. The sallows, birches, and alders 
growing on the heaths are very productive of larve, the following 
being found in greater or lesser abundance: S. populz, S. ocellatus, 
C. furcula, D. vinula, P. dicteoides, N. ziczac, N. dromedarius, 
LL. camelina, N. cucullatella, A. leporina, S. libatrizx, and A. betularia 
(no example of var. dowbledayaria has yet been obtained); also 
M. rubi, M. pisi, and A. myrtilli on the heather; D. capsincola 
feeding on the seed-heads of Lychnis; C. glaucata, B. bimaculata 
(rare), and B. temerata (common), on hawthorn. (It may here be 
mentioned that a curious variety of L. camelina emerged on March 
29th, 1908, the right wings being of a pale buff colour, while those 
on the left are the typical reddish brown.) On hazel the larve of 
P. bucephala are found in large numbers, while those of D. coryli, on 
the same tree, are of rare occurrence. Larve of D. pudibunda, 
P. similis, M. neustria, A. pst, and A. rwmicis have also been 
obtained. In the spring the sallow catkins are a great attraction to 
P. rubricosa, T. gothica, T. stabilis, T. incerta, T. pulverulenta, 
7’. munda (not very common), 7’. gracilis, X. areola (a curious chalky- 
white form), together with O. vaccinit, E. satellitia, X. socia (one 
specimen), C. vetusta, and C. exoleta. At the same time of year 
searching low plants at night produces larve of N. triangulum, 
N. baia, N. primule, N. rubi, N. xanthographa, T. comes, T. pronuba, 
T’. fimbria, E. lichenea (feeding on stonecrop on the sand-hills), and 


286 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


B. lichenaria (on lichens growing on apple-trees). Later in the year 
numerous moths come to “sugar,” and besides those already men- 
tioned as larvee are H. derasa, T. batis, A. segetum, A. exclamationis, 
A. ypsilon, N. glareosa, N. depuncta (a single specimen), N. c-nigrum, 
N. brunnea, N. plecta, T. tanthina, E. prasina (four examples only), 
EH. occulta (one specimen), EH. nebulosa, B. brassicae, M. oleracea, 
C. graminis, C. matura, M. strigilis, M. literosa, M. bicoloria (rather 
scarce), X. lithoxylea, X. monoglypha (ab. perfusca, one example), 
A. lutulenta, P. chi, P. meticulosa, M. maura, N. typica, L. pallens 
(reddish form), LZ. wmpura, L. lithargyria, L. conigera, C. quadri- 
punctata, M. tragopogonis, and X. circellaris. Flowers are also very 
attractive—lavender to A. triplasia, H. sylvina, &amp;e.; sage to N. wm- 
brosa and C. taraxact; while ragwort produces plenty of Z’. znterjecta, 
H. nictitans, H. micacea, &amp;e. A strong acetylene light and a sheet 
have been the means of obtaining D. falcataria, C. glaucata, S. lubri- 
cipeda, S. menthrastri, L. lurideola, A. agathina (one specimen), 
EH. popularis, T. cespitis, L. testacea, S. anomala, C. xerampelina, 
A. lunosa, A. lychnidis, X. fulvago, X. flavago, P. chrysitis, P. gamma, 
H. proboscidalis, P. pruinata, G. papilionaria, H. strigata, A. aversata, 
A. bisetata, O. linutata, C. brumata, T. dubitata, L. prunata, L. tes- 
tata, C. truncata, C. siterata, C. miata, L. suffumata, C. ferrugata, 
A. viridaria, M. didymata, X. montanata, X. fluctuata, X. sociata, 
P. alchemillata, C. bilineata, H. furcata, A. badiata, EH. vulgata, 
HE. rectangulata, A. sylvata, A. grossulariata, L. marginata, L. adus- 
tata, C. pusarva, M. margaritaria, H. almaria, S. bilunaria, C. bidentata, 
C. elinguaria, O. sambucaria, O. luteolata, EH. apiciaria, H. marginaria, 
A. escularia, B. gemmaria, B. repandata, and one example of H. fusco- 
nebulosa ab. gallicus; also, on the sand-hills, P. dictea, A. vestigialis, 
A. cursoria, A. tritici, A. strigula, A. precox, EH. lichenea, T. fulva, 
G. obscurata, and X. galiata. The following moths have been taken 
on the wing :—WM. stellatarum, C. potatoria (one specimen on the 
sand-hills), O. qwadra (one example; one larva has also been found), 
P. interrogationis (one example on heath), H. humuli, and H. lupu- 
lina. In April the pup of M. thalassina are abundant under moss 
on rocks and stone walls, and in August the tall marsh thistles con- 
tain the pupee of O. ochracea. 

On the whole it may be said that Anglesey is fairly productive of 
Lepidoptera, much, however, depending on the season.—H. §. A.

EntomoLocicaL Society or Lonpon.— Wednesday, October 6th, 
1909.—Dr. F. A. Dixey, M.A., M.D., President, in the chair.—Mr. 
Hugh Scott, B.A., Trinity College, and the Museum of Zoology, 
Cambridge, and Mr. Carlton C. Goudey, B.Sc., Uganda, British Hast 
Africa, were elected Fellows of the Society.—Sir George Hampson 
brought for exhibition the unique example of a Noctuid moth new to 
science, captured in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen by Mr. L. G. 
Esson, and presented to the National Collection by the Hon. N. C. 
Rothschild. It would be necessary, he said, to constitute a new 
genus for it, as it presented characters not known to exist in allied 


SOCIETIES. 287 


species.—Mr. A. H. Jones exhibited examples of Melit@a deione, from 
La Grave, and aberrant forms of MW. didyma, from Digne, taken in 
July last. This is the first record of the former species occurring so 
far north in the French Alps, and it is noteworthy that the speci- 
mens showed a nearer affinity to the meridional form than to the 
var. berisalensis of the Rhone Valley in Switzerland—Mr. G. C. 
Dudgeon sent for exhibition a case containing examples of new and 
little-known butterflies from West Africa, together with notes and 
descriptions.—Professor T. Hudson Beare exhibited specimens of the 
very local and rare Trechus rivularis, Gyll., taken at Wicken Fen on 
September 15th, 1909; also of Pseudopsis sulcata, New., taken at 
Sandown, Isle of Wight, in haystack refuse, in August last. This 
genus and species were originally described by Newman on speci- 
mens taken in the Isle of Wight. The species has never been taken 
in the island since that date until the present capture —Mr. H. St. J. 
Donisthorpe showed examples of the following :—(a) Tychius poly- 
lineatus, Germ., taken at Ditchling by Mr. Dollman and himself on 
September 9th; (6) Trechus rivularis, Gyll., taken as above; the rare 
Dipteron (c) Meigenia floralis, Fall.; also (d) Phytodecta pallida, 
bred from larve taken at Chilworth in July last, with the pupa-case 
on the larval-skin of the beetle; and the following Braconidex (e) 
Huphorus bistigmaticus, Morley, n.s. male type bred from F. rufa 
nest from Weybridge, June 15th, 1909; females taken hovering over 
F. rufa nests at Weybridge, July 7th, and Beaulieu Forest, July 
21st, all of this year. (f) Spelomma falconivibrans, Morley, n. g. 
et s. male and female bred from fF’. fusca nest from Porlock, July 
29th, 1907; and (g) Pachylomma buccata female tuken at St. Helen’s, 
Isle of Wight, hovering over nests of Lasiws niger—Mr. W. J. Lucas 
showed a male and female example of Ascalaphus coccajus, and a pair 
of the same insect near the var. lewcocilius, with the golden yellow 
markings replaced by white. They were taken by the Rey. F. D. 
Morice, with other specimens, in June of this year, at Geneva.— 
Mr. G. Bethune-Baker showed a series of Chrysophanus dorcas, 
which occurs in North America from Labrador, and Alaska down to 
Michigan, in marshy localities, and pointed out the peculiar charac- 
teristic of the egg, which is more Thecloid than Chrysophanid. He 
also exhibited a finely radiated example of Chrysophanus hypophleas ; 
also a North American species.—Mr. G. F. Leigh exhibited the female 
parent and twenty-one specimens of the offspring of Charazes 
zoolina neanthes. This result was obtained from ova deposited by 
the zoolina form of the female, and produced four males and two 
females like the parent, and fifteen males and nine females of the 
neanthes form. Last year the same result was obtained in a smaller 
degree, but the eggs on that occasion were obtained from the neanthes 
form of the female. Mr. Leigh remarked that although the zoolina 
forms are consistent in both the wet and dry season, there are two 
quite distinct forms of the neanthes variety.—Mr. H. Eltringham, 
M.A., F.Z.8., read a paper on “ Edibility Experiments with Larvee 
and Lizards.’’—Mr. F. Enock, F.L.S., read a paper on “‘ New British 
Mymaride,”’ and illustrated his remarks with a number of lantern- 
slides of both sexes of the species discovered and described by 
him. The following papers were also communicated :—‘‘ On the

OBITUARY. 


Henry WituiaM Barker, who for some years had resided at 171, 
Gordon Road, Peckham, died of pleurisy after about a week’s illness 
on the 21st September last at the comparatively early age of forty- 
nine years, leaving a widow and two daughters surviving. 

From 1886 to 1893 Mr. Barker occupied the position of Hon. 
Secretary of the South London Entomological and Natural History 
Society. During this somewhat critical period of the Society's 
existence he proved himself of the greatest assistance, and when he 
retired from that office in March, 1893, owing to pressure of business, 
he was the recipient of a written testimonial of thanks from practi- 
cally every member of the Society. 

In the year 1887 he became a Fellow of the Entomological 
Society. 

He was a good type of the hard-working field Naturalist, and got 
together a nice collection of British Macro-Lepidoptera, mostly 
taken or bred by himself, and which we understand is destined for 
“Stevens” at an early date. ' T- W. H.

LUPERINA GUENEEI, Dsu., anp var. BAXTERI, 
VAR. NOV. 


By Ricwarp SoutuH. 
(Prats, VIT): 


Tue original description of gueneet as published in the 
‘Entomologists’ Annual’ for 1864, p. 123 :— 


‘* LUPERINA GUENEEI, H. Dbl., n. sp. 


‘* Alis pallide testaceis albo nigroque irroratis, strigis duabus 
ex lunulis confertis nigris, pallide extus adnotis, compositis ; 
ciliis maculatis. 

‘* Expansio alarum 1 une. 5 lin. 

‘“‘Thorax pale griseous, mixed with white. Abdomen very pale. 
Anterior wings pale testaceous, irrorated with black and white 
atoms—an indistinct interrupted pale striga before the middle— 
then a second arcuated striga composed of black lunules, edged 
externally with whitish; the first striga terminates in a rather con- 
spicuous black dot on the inner mar gin of the wing, the ordinary 
stigmata are placed between these strige, the reniform one being 
distinctly edged with white. Between the black dots on the 
inner margin. of the wing and the thorax is a slender black line. 
Hinder margin pale testaceous, with an indistinct undulating 
pale line, commencing at a pale patch on the costa near the 
apex. A distinct row of black marginal lunules, cilia spotted 
with deep and pale fuscous. On the costa near the apex are two 
oblique white spots. Posterior wings pure white in both sexes, 
with black marginal lunules. Antenne of the male rather 
strongly ciliated.” 


The late Mr. J. B. Hodgkinson, in a note on Luperina guencei, 
published in the ‘Entomologist’ for 1885 (xviil. 54), wrote :— 


ENTOM.—DECEMBER, 1909. Aa 3 


290 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


‘In 1860 or 1861, T. Porter (still living) brought me two fine 
specimens of a moth I did not know. They were of both sexes. 
I purchased them from him, and sent them on to the Rev. H. 
Burney, who forwarded them to Henry Doubleday. From him 
they went to Guenée, and he returned them with the remark that 
he had a specimen in his collection marked as a variety of 
L. testacea, but he was quite satisfied they represented a good 
species when he saw both sexes. H. Doubleday then named 
them after Guenée, as the latter was evidently the original 
captor. I saw Porter again, and he told me another man, by 
name H. Stephenson, hadone. They took three in all near the 
ferry at Rhyl, North Wales. I sent Porter again, and went 
myself, but we failed to find more afterwards. I bought the 
specimen from Stephenson, and sent it to Miss Sulivan, of 
Fulham, where, I suppose, it remains. I think it was a female.” 

Barrett (Brit. Lep. iv. p. 835), in referring to the three North 
Wales specimens, states that they ‘‘ were raked from overhanging 
edges of sandhills.” 

The foregoing then appears to be all that was definitely known 
of the British history of gueneet up to 1889, in which year Mr. 
Baxter sent me a specimen which, as already adverted to (antea, 
p. 269), I then thought was a link connecting gueneeit with 
nickerlii. It was this specimen, Mr. Baxter informs me, that 
Mr. Tutt described as Luperina testacea var. incerta, and not the 
1891 example. In my remarks on the specimen (Entom. xxii. 
p. 271) the ground colour was noted as being pale grey. Tutt 
(Brit. Noct. 1. p. 140) describes the ground colour of the fore 
wings of incerta as ‘‘ greyish fuscous, with a slight ochreous 
tinge.” At the present time the 1889 and the 1891 specimens 
are both distinctly tinged with ochreous. These two specimens, 
however, are referable to LL. gueneet, Doubleday,* a female 
type of which is in the National Collection at South Kensing- 
ton. I may add that Sir George Hampson concurs in this 
identification. The specimens obtained this year are of a 
rather different form ; therefore, as it is largely due to Mr. 
Baxter’s patient investigation that the Luperina muddle of 
twenty years’ standing has been cleared up, I propose that this 
form be known as :— 


Var. baxteri (Pl. VII., figs. 3 g, 4 ?).— Ground colour paler, 
and without the ochreous tinge of gueneev. The black edging of 
the whitish transverse lines varies in intensity, but in two of the 
six specimens this is inconspicuous ; the reniform stigma is more 
or less outlined in white, but this character is less evident than in 


** This was from the Burney collection; a co-type was acquired by the 
late Mr. P. B. Mason from the same collection, and this subsequently passed 
into the possession of Mr. E. R. Bankes when Mason’s collection was dis- 
persed in 1905. 


LUPERINA GUENEEI VAR. BAXTERI. 291 


L. nickerlii. The fringes are pale, chequered with dark grey, their 
tips sometimes dotted with blackish. In two females a blackish bar 
extends from the claviform stigma to the post-medial line, and in 
these specimens the area beyond the white submarginal line is pale, 
almost whitish. White dots on the costa between the post-medial 
line and the apex are present in some of the specimens. Expanse, 
3S 32-34 millim.; ? 36-38 millim. 


The following is an abstract from Mr. Baxter’s note sent with 
the insects referred to above :— 


“In 1891 I captured a second specimen of the Luperina 
thought to be a form of nickerlii, but from that time until the 
present year I had not been lucky enough to see any others. 
This was chiefly, perhaps, because I had not been working in the 
right kind of place. ‘This year a friend of mine and brother 
collector, Mr. W. Yates, while out with me one evening, came 
across a Luperina which, on his showing it to me, I at once recog- 
nized to be the same species as my two previous captures. Since 
then I have taken six, and I believe Mr. Yates has taken five or 
six more. Some entomologists who saw the first specimen seemed 
to think that it was an immigrant, but this year’s experience 
completely disposes of this, as I found one evidently just 
emerged, as it had a small piece of the pupa-case adhering to 
it, and on another occasion I found one drying its wings. Mr. 
Yates also found one drying its wings. I also found a crippled 
female which was certainly incapable of flying from the Conti- 
nent; all which conclusively proves, I think, that the insect is 
British. The moths were not found all on one spot, but nearly 
two miles apart. 

** All that Mr. Yates and I have found are similar in character 
to the 1889 one, and although they vary slightly in the depth of 
colouring, all are bright silvery grey, with very little trace of 
ochreous, except one, a rather worn male, which I have sent to 
Mr. Pierce, of Liverpool, who has kindly undertaken to examine 
the genitalia; this one was slightly more ochreous than any of 
the others. At the first glance the specimen might almost be 
taken for the light grey form of Agrotis ripe. This Luperina is 
decidedly a coast insect, and I have only seen one L. testacea 
where it is found.”—T. Baxter; Min-y-don, St. Anne’s-on-the- 
Sea, Lanes. 


In addition to the ochreous specimen mentioned in his note, 
Mr. Baxter forwarded a second example to Mr. Pierce, whose 
report thereon is appended :— 


‘‘] have examined nine specimens of Luperina testacea, all of 
which are exactly similar, and two specimens of a new species 
which agree inter se, but differ from testacea in five very distinct 
points as follows :— 

2B 2 


292 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Trestacea (PI. VILI., fig. 6). New Specigs (Pl. VIL, fig. 5). 
Harpe angulated, without corona, Harpe angulated, without corona, 
apex rounded. apex bluntly pointed. 
Clavus angulated to a point, Clavus roughly rounded, smooth, 
densely clothed with short hairs. | with a few scattered hairs. 
Uncus cygnated. Uncus cygnated, larger than tes- 
tacea. 


/Adwagus scobinated, with fowr Aidceagus scobinated, with a

rows along the vesica, then ex- _—_— wards its opening. 
tend in a double line towards 
the opening. 

Vesica with a number of small Vesica with a number of cornuti 
cornuti. larger than testacea. 


‘‘T have therefore no hesitation in pronouncing these light 
specimens to be absolutely distinct, and apparently constant. 
Whether they are identical with the Luperina nickerlit of Freyer 
or not I am at present unable to say, as I have so far failed 
to obtain specimens of this species for examination.” —F. N. 
PIERCE. 


Since the above report was communicated, Mr. Pierce has 
obtained a pair of nickerlit from Messrs. Watkins and Doncaster. 
I also sent him a male specimen from Bohemia that I received, 
together with an example of the female, from Hermann Rolle, of 
Berlin. I, too, have a male specimen through the same source 
as Mr. Pierce. 

Examination of the genitalia is not yet complete, but so far 
as it has gone Mr. Pierce has decided that nickerlii is not the 
same species as the Lancashire Luperina, and he is further of 
opinion that nickerlit, as represented by the specimens he has, 
may prove to be a form of L. testacea. L. gueneei then will stand 
as a distinet species, and the status of nickerlii must await the 
result of further examination. In the meantime I present, on 
Plate VII., figures of two of the nickerlii that I have. Fig. 2 
represents a male which was in an old collection in Vienna, and 
was originally taken by Herr Nickerl, in the neighbourhood of 
Prague, about fifty years ago. Fig. 1 shows a female specimen 
from Bohemia. The ground colour of all the specimens is 
brownish grey suffused with deeper brown; this suffusion is 
deeper in the male figured than in the female. The male sent 
to Mr. Pierce agrees in colour with the female figured. 

Concerning the distribution of nickerlit very little is known ; 
it has been recorded from Germany and South France, but its 
home seems to be in Bohemia. L. gueneet appears to be almost 
exclusively British.

NATURAL ORDERS OF INSECTS. 
By W.. J. duucss, B.A JF 3K.S: 


THosk who are interested in any group of insects coming 
within the Neuroptera (sensu lato) will welcome Dr. Sharp’s pro- 
nouncement in last month’s ‘ Entomologist’ on an arrangement 
of the Natural Order of Insects that falls in line with present- 
day opinions. At first sight the list seems somewhat revolu- 
tionary. A second glance, however, shews that the changes 
from the well-known nine are really slight. They are mainly 
two: (1) Breaking up the old Neuroptera into the parts, which 
everyone who has had to do with them has always recognised, 
and which many have long been accustomed to consider distinct 
orders. (2) Placing together and giving ordinate rank to three 
groups of apparently degenerate, but at any rate distinct, insects, 
about which verhaps further may be learned in the future. The 
old Aptera comprising the first three orders in the new list 
differ so much from one another that probably if they had their 
due they should be still further sub-divided; but their numbers 
are so few that in practice this is unnecessary. For the orders 
containing normally winged insects it seems well to adopt names 
ending in -ptera if possible; perhaps it might be wise to do the 
reverse with the rest. This could be done with very little 
change in nomenclature, except in the case of the Siphonaptera 
and Odonata. 


THE DRAGONFLIES OF EPPING FOREST IN 1909. 
By F. W. &amp; H. Campion. 


Notwitustanpine the deplorable weather, we collected during 
the past season as many as fifteen species of Odonata in the 
Epping Forest district; none of these, however, were new to our 
local list. It will be noticed from the following remarks on the 
species observed that exceptionally late dates were recorded for 
Pyrrhosoma nymphula (August 15th), Agrion puella (September 
12th), Cordulia enea (August 4th), Erythromma naias (August 
Atk), and Anax imperator (August 15th). 

(1) Pyrrhosoma nymphula.—Immature specimens were met 
with plentifully on May 9th, at which time females preponderated 
greatly over males. By May 23rd pairs were flying in couple and 
ovipositing. Teneral individuals occurred as late in the season 
as June 13th, and the species continued in flight until Aug. 15th 
at all events, on which date an aged male was taken. This is 
the latest date for P. nymphula within our experience, although 
we have previously taken it in August (August 1st, 1904). The 
form of the female named /ulvipes was taken on May 9th, 16th, 


294 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


and 30th, and August 8th. The last-named specimen was very 
small, as it attained no more than 82°5 mm. in length and no 
more than 43°5 mm. in expanse. 

(2) Agrion puella was not met with until May 23rd, when 
some mature males were taken. The period occupied by the 
emergence of the various individuals was an unusually pro- 
tracted one, swarms of immature examples occurring at some of 
the ponds as late as May 30th, and the species was still emerg- 
ing on July 4th. On July 18th quite a remarkable series of 
melanic males was obtained from one small pond; the addi- 
tional black spots were mostly irregular in shape and position, 
and the different specimens varied in the amount of melanism 
exhibited. A male was taken in another part of the Forest with 
the moth Vortrix viridana in its clutches: we made an identical 
observation on June 28th, 1908. Again on July 18th a female 
had her abdomen thickly encrusted with mud, and it was inferred 
that she had been ovipositing in wet clay. On August 29th a 
female was obtained with the green ground-colour becoming 
blue; the blue was strongly marked at the wing-bases and on 
segments 1 and 2. Females with cuneiform green or blue spots 
on segments 3 to 6 were taken on May 23rd, July 4th and 18th, 
and August 22nd. A solitary male, in fine condition, was obtained 
as late as September 12th: this date is eleven days later than 
our previous latest date for the species (September 1st, 1903). 

(3) Ischnura elegans.—When the species was first met with 
(May 23rd), it was already in mature condition, but an immature 
male occurred as late as August 4th. The female form called 
rufescens was taken on July 4th, and the form distinguished as 
infuscans on July 4th and September 5th. The female having 
segment 8 coloured as in infuscans, but haying the humeral 
stripes on the thorax obsolete, was obtained on August 4th. 

(4) Cordulia enea.—The earliest capture was made on May 
23rd, when the specimens come across showed a strong dis- 
position to fly about the tree-tops. ‘he species remained on 
the wing an unusually long time, and males were taken on 
July 18th, and another was observed in flight as late as 
August 4th. Females were, as usual, seldom seen, and only 
one capture could be effected (June 18th). The total length of 
this example was 48°5 mm., and the alar expanse 68°5 mm. 

(5) Libellula depressa.—The flight of this dragonfly was 
observed to extend from May 28rd to August 4th. 

(6) Brachytron hafniense (= pratense).—An evacuated nymph- 
skin, referred to this species, was obtained on May 28rd. ‘Ihe 
first imago was taken on May 30th, when as many as five 
specimens were seen. The insect was taken again on June 13th. 
An examination of several fresh specimens caught during the 
year showed that the current description of the colours of 
B. hafniense needs amendment or amplification in these re- 


THE DRAGONFLIES OF EPPING FOREST IN 1909. 295 


spects:—¢: The following parts are apple-green, not yellow— 
longitudinal stripes on thorax, sides of thorax and of segment 1, 
wing-bases and prominences between them. ¢ (Adult): Eyes 
blue above and brown below; sides of thorax and of abdomen 
apple-green. 

(7) Erythromma naias.—Two freshly emerged females taken 
on May 30th exhibited a dull-green coloration, with purple- 
bronze on the upper surface. The eyes of some fully adult 
females taken on August 4th were noted as being reddish- 
brown above and yellowish-green below. One specimen was very 
small, its length being only 84°5 mm., and its expanse only 
45 mm. It is interesting to compare this female with an un- 
usually large one netted in the same locality on June 14th, 1908 
(length 38 mm., expanse 51 mm.). 

(8) Enallagma cyathigerwm was not observed until August 
4th. On August 15th a blue female was obtained, as well as a 
male having the spot on segment 2 entirely disconnected from 
the circlet behind. A male caught on September 12th was dis- 
covered to have prey in its jaws, which turned out, upon exami- 
nation by Mr. Charles 0. Waterhouse, to be portions of a gnat 
(Culex sp.). 

(9) Anas imperator was first seen on August 4th, and a 
male was taken on the 15th of the same month. 

(10) Afschna grandis.—On August 4th a newly emerged 
female was found and mature specimens were seen in flight. On 
August 8th and 29th females were busy ovipositing. 

(11) Sympetrum striolatum.—On August 4th, when the species 
was first met with, a fully-matured male was found, as well 
as teneral specimens. A partially consumed insect, determined 
by Mr. Waterhouse as the remains of a Muscid fly, was extracted 
from the jaws of a male taken on September 5th. The last 
specimens, a male and female, were taken on October 24th. 

(12) Calopteryx splendens. — A visit was paid to the River 
Roding on August 15th, and a fine male of this species was 
secured ; a female was also seen, but not taken. 

(18) Afschna cyanea was taken for the first time on August 
15th, and for the last time on September 12th. 

(14) Sympetrum sanguineum. — Three males were obtained 
on August 29th. One of them was of the largest size, and 
another was exceptionally small, measuring only 380°5 mm. in 
length, and 49 mm. in expanse of hind wings. Some of the 
males taken this year, like others taken in previous years, show 
the strongly marked constriction of the abdomen, at the suture 
between segments 8 and 9, seen in Charpentier’s figure of his 
Libellula nigripes (= sanguineum, Mull.). 

(15) Lestes sponsa was found to be present in some numbers 
when Coopersale Common was visited on September 7th. In 
view of the Abbé Pierre’s discovery of the gall-making habit of 


296 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


L. viridis, a prolonged search was made among willows and 
other plants growing near the water for any similar gall-like 
swellings of the twigs caused by L. sponsa. There was, however, 
nothing to indicate that the remarkable habit referred to is 
shared by the British insect. 

A. puella, I. elegans, H. cyathigerum, 4. grandis, di. cyanea, 
S. sanguineum, and L. sponsa, were all taken for the last time on 
September 12th. 

Larval water-mites (Hydrachnide) were observed upon P. 
nymphula (May 9th and 16th), A. puella (May 28rd and 30th, 
and June 18th and 20th), and E. cyathigerum (August 29th). In 
most, if not in all, of these cases the parasites were confined 
to the sternum of their host.

BUTTERFLIES OF CANTAL AND LOZERE. 297 


Sitowski (8) publishes a brief note on his experiments in 
giving wool together with an aniline dye (‘Sudan III.”) to the 
caterpillars of Tincola biselliella, causing their bodies to be 
coloured red, the adipose tissue being the most intensely stained. 
The pup and moths resulting continued to preserve the typical 
red colour. There was an accumulation of dye in the ovary, and 
the eggs were also stained. 

Fernald (2) advocates tarring the seed of maize, then placing 
it ‘in a bucket containing fine dust and Paris green mixed in 
such proportions that the corn [maize], after being shaken up 
in the bucket, showed a greenish colour.’ The treatment is 
doubtless applicable to other seeds. 

Silvestri (7) gives an exceedingly interesting detailed report 
on his observations on a tour to investigate economic entomo- 
logy in the United States. A translation of the principal part 
has appeared in the ‘ Hawaiian Forester.’ 

Busck (1) gives a summary of Boving’s researches on the life 
history of the Donaciide. 

The caterpillars investigated by Forbes (3) were daplidice, 
rapé, and brassice. 

The other titles are self-explanatory. 


SOME AUGUST BUTTERFLIES OF CANTAL AND 
LOZERE.* 


By H. Rowzanp-Browy, M.A., F.E.S. 
(Concluded from p. 269.) 


Looxine through my old entomological note-books, I find 
that when in 1901 I visited the northern parts of Lozére, in 
company with Mr. A. H. Jones, I scarcely did justice to the 
possibilities of Mende and the surrounding mountains.+ On that 
occasion we arrived there from the Gorges of the Tarn the last 
week in July, and the weather was most unsettled ; the two days’ 
collecting afforded, therefore, but a very poor idea of the pro- 


* Ab. escherinus, n.ab.—Since writing the above, and the publication of 
the figures at p. 267, I have discovered among the females of P. eschertv in 
my collection a magnificent example taken at St. Martin-Vésubie, July, 1902, 
corresponding to the aberration of the male taken in Lozére. Under side: 
ground colour rich fawn-brown ; antemarginal spots, upper wings, reduced 
irregularly, two only on the right, one on the left wing; lower wings, ante- 
marginal spots, left wing, wholly obsolete; right wing, one very small near 
the anal angle. 

+ The first mention I can find of Mende as an entomological centre is to 
be found in a paper by M. C. Oberthiir, included in the Ann. Soc. Ent. 
France, 41 sér. tome iv. 1864, pp. 181-194, entitled ‘‘ Excursion Entomolo- 
gique dans le Lozére,” which gives some account of the butterflies met with, 
but chiefly deals with the fauna of Florac further south. 


298 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


fusion of butterfly life at this particular central spot of France, 
which in so many respects preserves the characteristic flora and 
fauna of the Midi. In the earlier weeks of the summer I have 
no doubt that it would well repay my ‘ palearctic”’ friends who 
spend their holidays each year in the better-known departments 
of the south and south-east to investigate Lozére, and in the last 
nine years the lines of approach have been greatly extended. 
Mende, then but to be reached by the tortuous, dilatory trains 
of the west, is now in direct touch with the P. L. M. from 
la Bastide, on the Paris-Nimes line. Florac has been linked 
up by a new branch of the same line from St. Cécile d’Andorge, 
and will benefit immediately by the new clean hotels which 
have, I understand, superseded the unclean hostelries of a 
more primitive era. Recognizing, therefore, that the season 
was now far advanced, and anxious to maintain a decent altitude 
in consequence, on August 6th I took train for Mende, en route 
passing over the Garabit viaduct, once famous as possessing 
the longest span of any bridge in Europe. With every hour 
thence the landscape took on some pleasant feature of the south ; 
the volcanic soil disappeared, and presently in its place the 
cuttings and little hills displayed the unmistakable limestone 
formation dear to the heart of the entomologist. 

After the cool, unproductive green country of Cantal, the 
change to the limestone hillsides of Lozére was welcome indeed. 
For the slopes of the Causses, however barren and wind-swept 
the plateaux themselves, are a feast of colour and flowery 
luxuriance where they fall to the valleys. As I have so often 
observed elsewhere in the higher alpine regions of Central 
Europe, the most favourable haunts for butterflies are the deep 
inset gullies which reach as a rule from summit to foot of the 
escarpments, and in spring, when the snow melts, are the water- 
courses by which the upland levels are drained, and the torrents 
carried off from the mountains. On the cloudless, still August 
morning of the 7th the lavender was in full bloom, the air 
musical with the sound of myriad insects, and every spire of 
fragrant bloom alive with countless butterflies—the rearguard for 
the most part of the seasonal broods. Occasional small forests 
of Austrian fir have sprung up, testifying to the skill of the de- 
partment which is working with such success to reafforest the 
dry uplands of France, while here, there, and everywhere grows 
a species of Hhamnus which serves for Gonopteryx cleopatra and 
G. rhamni—taken together on the 9th—one male only of the 
former, anda female which might have belonged to either species; 
the male of rhamni being decidedly common on this and suc- 
ceeding days. Anthyllis, the great white Medicago, and in- 
numerable Papilionacee, seldom seen upon the volcanic formation 
at le Lioran, all suggested Lycenid visitants, as well as the 
cytisus and laburnum trees, now laden with red-green pods,

Here also were the prickly blue thistles to lend a decidedly 
meridional touch of colour among the lavender ; while the 
scanty hedges which divide the cultivated lucerne and sainfoin 
fields of the main valley of the Lot from the stony approaches 
to the Causse were hung with scented clematis, with a dense 
underwood of wild gooseberries, exuberant of thorns, but jewelled 
with tiny luscious gold and crimson fruits—welcome dessert to 
the al fresco luncheon in a land where no water is to be found. 
The butterflies about were largely composed of Satyride ; Satyrus 
alcyone perhaps the most in evidence, but Hipparchia semele and 
circe running it close in point of numbers. S. hermione was 
hardly less abundant with briseis, chiefly males, and just coming 
on in full force. But for sheer beauty of colour they had no 
chance with Pyrameis atalanta and P. cardui, whose folded wings 
as they banqueted blended in perfect harmony with the delicate 
pearly greys and lilac shadow of the lavender. 

On this well-remembered ground nothing is more curious 
than the extraordinary localization of species. I recall having 
taken ‘J'hymelicus act@on in 1901 at a certain corner where 
there was a little waste of scrub and rushes. The bushes had 
grown considerably, but the intervening spaces provided me with 
half a dozen examples or so, and precisely the same rule ap- 
peared to govern the limitations of Polyommatus dolus, for neither 
was to be taken, now or then, outside these curiously restricted 
areas, though by walking the whole way to Balsiege along the 
Causse I struck several colonies of the lovely and little-known 
“blue,” which, taking the form var. vittata, Oberth., and extend- 
ing from the Atlantic slope of the Lozere Mountains, seems, at 
Ytrac and Aurillac, in the valley of the Cére, to reach its north- 
western limit in France, though the discovery of the species at 
Aguessac (Aveyron) by M. René Oberthur’s collector may con- 
tinue the ‘‘life-line,” so to speak, further south-west than at 
present suspected. The first day I was on the dolus ground at 
Balsiége—a dry torrent-bed, filled with lavender, white melilot, 
wild mallow, and other herbs, about half a mile towards Mende 
from the village—I arrived at noon, but the sky was temporarily 
clouded, with high wind, and it was not until four o’clock that 
I suddenly espied a wasted male flitting in company with some 
beautifully fresh P. corydon, ab. aurantia, to which, on the wing, 
it bears a close resemblance. Tvidently 1 was too late by a good 
ten days, and of the eight or nine males selected but two have 
attained to ‘‘cabinet rank”! As for the females, to separate 
. the which from P. damon is a standing entomological puzzle, 
not one could I discover. Yet one would have expected a few 
surviving with the last of the males, for they were flying here 
nine years ago in profusion. In vain I searched the scanty 
sainfoin patches which are its habitat. I could find only males 
of P. damon, with occasional flashes of P. hylas, surely one of 


300 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


the most exquisite of Lycenids, if not as variable in the depth 
and quality of its colour as another very common Causse 
member of the family, P. escheri; escheri, indeed, appearing to 
exhaust the whole gamut of the colour tones we describe loosely 
as “‘blue.” The most usual, I suppose, is the rather mazarine- 
tinted form of the French Alps; then there is the deep steely- 
blue form with dark suffused borders from the Simplon, while 
examples from Bosnia exhibit the silky azure familiar in our 
alternative form of bellargus. On the under side it appears to be 
among the most constant of the ‘blues,’ but this year at 
Mende, where it occurred always in great abundance—and I 
even netted a few females from plants of Anthyllis, though I 
never found the sexes flying together —I took one male (figured, 
p. 267), which in general appearance of the under side is not 
unlike that of the form of C. var. gordius, ab. midas, Lowe; the 
antemarginal spots have entirely disappeared ; the discoidal spot 
is large and pronounced. We might venture to call this ab. 
escherinus, new ab., I think, though perhaps it is commoner than 
I suppose, for I have seen a similar aberration from Bérisal in 
Mr. W. G. Sheldon’s collection. Another distinctive form of 
Lycenid in Lozére is the female P. alexis, which reproduces in 
miniature the warm, rich, uniform brown upper side and con- 
tinuous orange-spotted marginal bands of the lovely and larger 
unnamed summer race from Ajaccio, which I should like to 
denominate ab. flavocinctata, though I fancy, so far as Corsica 
is concerned, accepted asa form of P. alexis, it will some day 
be differentiated from the type as a constant variety at the 
least. 

Meanwhile a few battered P. baton were sharing the little 
patches of wild thyme with Thecla spint and Epinephele lycaon, 
the latter worn but still in countless profusion. Nor was Par- 
nassius apollo by any means rare—a fine form—the best capture 
I made being a magnificent female = ab. nevadensis, Obth., three 
and three-quarters uf an inch from apex to apex of the extended 
wings, on which the normal red spots are changed to a brilliant 
orange-yellow. The piece of waste on which I took nevadensis 
was, indeed, an ideal hunting-ground. It is situated on the 
slope of the Causse, a point about midway between Mende and 
Balsiege, where the railway crosses the road near a lonely farm- 
house sort of inn, which provided me with the requisites for a 
sufficient déjeuwner in a vine-clad harbour—bread and butter of 
the best, a cheese rather suggestive of Dorset ‘‘ blue vinny,” 
sardines, and light beer in bottles cool, and the veriest nectar for 
these burning August days. Above the lane the hill rises abruptly 
through ‘‘ garrigues ” (abandoned vineyards), well provided with 
sweet-smelling herbs and the universal lavender; and here, 
after eight years, I resumed acquaintance with the dainty 
Zygena sarpedon, the rarest of its kind hereabouts, flying briskly 


BUTTERFLIES OF CANTAL AND LOZERE. 301 


in the sunshine with Z. carniolica, Z. fausta var. faustina, Z. 
hilaris, and, more rarely, Z. lonicere, fausta being perhaps the 
most active, and allin goodorder. Both Colias edusa and C. hyale 
were also plentiful, and S. cordula, quite fresh, showed con- 
spicuously with their dark velvet wings on the daisies, which 
still supported a few Melanargia galatea ab. leucomelas, decidedly 
commoner than the type, though invariably too broken for the 
collecting-boxes. FF ritillaries were few and far between: A. 
adippe, A. aglaia, and A. niobe var. eris; A. selene—one almost 
unrecognizable example—with M. athalia and M. didyma, were 
only ‘‘ occasionals’”’ ; Canonympha dorus very common, but all 
shabby fellows, and almost vanished before the week I spent on 
Causse was finished. I may add that the ‘ Hotel des Voyageurs’ 
at Mende offers good accommodation (in the dépendence), and 
the abundant fruit supplies and trout from the Lot (by the 
banks of which charming river I found Papilio machaon one 
sunny morning in some numbers) afford the chef opportunities 
of which he is not slow to take advantage. Seven frances a day 
for a good room and full pension reminds one of the palmy days 
of Switzerland as we remember it thirty years ago, with an 
infinitely better cuisine included ; and prices generally in this 
part of France rule decidedly low, even small tips being received 
with civility and gratitude. 

Leaving Mende on the 14th, I passed the night at Bort 
(Correse), a small town prettily situated on another good 
trout-stream, the Upper Dordogne, and having a couple of 
hours before the Paris train left, though it was tropically 
hot I strolled up towards the forests which encircle the 
perpendicular cliffs known as the Orgues de Bort, but, with 
the exception of Dryas paphia, Ll eptosia sinapis, Melitea par- 
thenie, and abundant H. tithonus, I saw nothing on the wing; 
and next morning found me back at Paris, where the short 
spell of August summer was already at an end. From all 
accounts the weather from June onwards in France north 
and south was abnormally cloudy and wet, and this no doubt 
accounted largely for the meagre results of my collecting this 
year. But I think it worth remarking that at le Lioran the 
extraordinary flights of dragonflies in general and of Anax 
imperator in particular may have assisted to exterminate the 
already none too plentiful Rhopalocera. Often did I come upon a 
likely corner to find a couple of these fine insects in possession, 
and as they remained hawking over the flowers and low shrubs 
it appeared as though the butterflies instinctively dropped to the 
earth or took to covert. At all events, when Anax was about 
I had extremely poor luck with the Order of which I was in 
search. 

Of the Mende butterflies taken or observed by me the follow- 
ing is a complete list :—

SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 


By W. G. SuHeupon, F.E.S. 
(Concluded from p. 276.) 


SHortiy afterwards, the storm having ceased, I proceeded 
towards the hotel, to which I had only gone a few yards when 
another example was observed on the trunk of a tree. This 
was rendered practically torpid by the hail, and allowed me 
without difficulty to scrape it into the net, the only instance in 
which I succeeded in effecting a capture by this method. 

The first example was taken on June 19th, after which I did 
not see another until June 25th, on which day two were taken ; 
after this date, until I left Herculesbad, a few were taken each 
day, the total amassed being fourteen fine specimens, all males, 
and which I suppose involved about as many hours’ work. I 
believe P. roxelana is in some years quite abundant in the 
Kreuze wood; but it certainly was not so in 1909, and except at 
two spots I did not see more than three or four examples each 
day. At each of those exceptions grew a large oak tree, the 
upper parts of which were dead and preyed upon by various 
insects, chiefly the larve of Coleoptera, and no doubt it was the 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 303 


frass exuding that was the attraction to butterflies; on these 
trees every time I passed some five or six P. roxvelana were to be 
seen; but, except on one occasion when I netted two of them, 
they refused to come within reach, and, if disturbed by stones, 
flew away. I saw two examples at the top of the Coronini wood, 
one of which I captured. When not disturbed P. roxclana has a 
typically satyrid flight, and is much like in appearance a large 
P. mera, which haunts the same localities at the time of its emer- 
gence: when alarmed it makes a headlong rush through the sur- 
rounding trees and undergrowth, usually straight uphill or straight 
downhill, and on such ground as it frequents it is quite useless 
to pursue it if missed at the first stroke. I did not see anything 
that I could consider looked at all like Pararge climene, and I was 
told by Professor Schmidt that this species, for which Hercules- 
bad was noted, has not been seen there for the last ten years. 

The handsome Syntomis phegea was very abundant at Hercu- 
lesbad, contrary to the usual habits of the Zygenide, frequent- 
ing chiefly the shade of thick woods; on one occasion I 
observed an unusual instance of assembling with this species, 
sixteen males of which were flying and crawling round a space 
of a few inches on a bank in a wood. On. looking for the 
cause I found a erevice partly filled with a spider’s web, and in 
it, in the clutches of a large spider, an unfortunate female of 
S. phegaa. Other Zygenide noticed here were Zygena filipen- 
dule, Z. trifolii, Z. scabiose, Z. carniolica, and Z. achillee. A 
quite unexpected and gratifying sight at dusk was the quantities 
of fireflies which frequented the banks and woods. I captured a 
few of these, and found they were the male of a Coleopteron, 
Luciola mingrelica, very similar in size and general appearance to 
the male of our own glowworm. The light was not continuous, 
but as the insect flew along, at intervals of about three seconds, 
it had the power to cause a flash like that of an electric spark, 
and a very bright one, to issue from the under side of the anal 
segments of the abdomen. I was told that the majority of 
Hungarian entomologists were coleopterists, and when one sees 
the magnificent coleopterous fauna of that country one is not 
surprised; the Longicorns and rose beetles were especially 
grand, one species of the former, which was not uncommon, 
was as large as our stag beetle, and had antenne at least three 
inches in length. 

I left Herculesbad for Budapest en route for the Hohe Tatra 
on July 1st, Mr. Tylecote having returned to England a week 
previously. A rather quaint incident arose in connection with 
the visitor’s tax. This is payable by all who stay in the Bad for 
more than five days; the amount, varying from 2 to 24 krones, 
is assessed by the local authorities on their views as to each 
person’s means and position; the evidence on which they proceed 
being contained in the form which all visitors are asked to fill up 


304 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


immediately on their arrival, and which includes their occupa- 
tion. I filled mine in without any thought of the result, but on 
my fifth day found myself called upon to pay 16 krones, whilst 
my friend, who is fortunate enough not to have an occupation, 
got off for 8 krones. I strongly protested at this manifest 
injustice, but was met by the argument: ‘‘ But you put yourself 
down as a ‘director.’ I hastened to explain that however digni- 
fied such an occupation might be in Hungary, in England there 
were plenty of very poor directors ; but it was of no use, I had to 
pay the 16 krones, and to console myself with thinking that some 
at least of my entomological predecessors visiting Herculesbad 
had paid considerably more. 

The Hohe Tatra is that portion of the great chain of moun- 
tains, the Carpathians, which rises out of the plain north-east of 
Budapest, at a distance of some 140 miles as the crow flies; it 
is the highest portion of the chain, rising in some of its peaks to 
an altitude of nearly 9000 ft., and although not covering a large 
area—which I suppose may measure roughly twenty miles by 
ten—it contains some of the finest mountain scenery to be found 
in Kurope. Strange to say, in spite of this and that it also con- 
tains some of the best hotels I have seen anywhere in Kurope, the 
Tatra is very little known to British tourists, and hardly at all to 
those of us who are entomologists. For although I happen to 
know that one or two British lepidopterists have visited it, there 
do not seem to be any published reports in English of the 
insect fauna of the region; at least I have been unable to dis- 
cover any, though of course it is well known to the Hungarians, 
and in a lesser degree to the Germans.* 

It was therefore with considerable curiosity and anticipation 
of something interesting that I proceeded thither. Unfortunately 
during my stay of eleven days, from the 38rd to the 18th of July, 
the weather was the very worst I have ever experienced in 
continental Europe, and I was only able to get amongst the 
alpine species on two occasions; on the first I only had a few 
minutes’ sunshine, and on the second occasion, although there 
was a fair amount of it, the temperatvre was so low I did not see 
a single butterfly on the wing. Eventually, after several days 
of almost continuous rain and mist, I had to give it up and come 
away. 

The Tatra from the treeless plain, which has an altitude 
of about 2000 ft. up to about 5000 ft., is thickly covered 
with forests of spruce; the hotels, of which there are a 
number, are principally scattered about these forests at an 
altitude of about 38000 ft. The climate is much colder than 
at a corresponding level in the Alps, and the whole district 
reminds one forcibly of some parts of Scotland. The moun- 
tains are chiefly of a granite formation, though in the east

SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 305 


there is a limestone range. The flora is a most interesting one, 
including many species familiar in the garden at home, especially 
of the Campanula group, whilst the great stretches of Spirea 
aruncus in the forest glades are among the finest natural floral 
effects I have seen. The cold climate and abundant rainfall is 
accountable no doubt for the rather scanty insect fauna, as 
compared with other parts of Hungary; and the specimens, 
though many of them are very interesting, have a tendency to 
run to obscurely marked forms and small size. I speak of the sub- 
alpine species, for it was only amongst these that I was able to 
make any observations. 

I arrived at the Palace Hotel, Tatra Lomnitz, about 7 a.m. 
on the 3rd July, after travelling all night from Budapest; the 
rain which had descended continuously for thirty-six hours was 
still in evidence, and after selecting a room and having a con- 
versation with the manager, during which he imparted to me 
the cheerful intelligence that it had rained off and on for the last 
three weeks, 1 decided to get some sleep. Awaking about noon 
I was delighted to see that the sun was shining, and after 
partaking of lunch sallied forth. I may mention here that the 
eround immediately around the Palace Hotel, ‘‘ Nagy Szal- 
loda,”’ in Magyar, especially on the side nearest Tatra Fured, 
is the best I could find in the Tatra. Leaving the hotel I bore 
to the left, and found myself in a grassy ride running through 
the spruce forest, with seats at intervals, and plenty of flowers; 
here butterflies were quite abundant, the first one netted being 
Erebia medusa var. hippomedusa, perhaps the most abundant 
species met with in the Tatra, and occurring everywhere I 
collected. . ligea var. adyte was not infrequent, and equally 
widely spread; a dark form of Cenonympha iphis, with the 
ocelli on the under side strongly developed, flitted here and there ; 
and around a swampy spot covered with rough tussocky grass I 
saw a Cenonympha of slightly different flight and somewhat 
browner tint; netting this I was delighted to find I had run to 
earth a butterfly taken by but few Britishers—C. hero; this 
species, which had evidently been out some time, was widely 
spread on the granite, wherever swamps covered with the rush- 
like grass were to be found. A flight familiar, but not seen for 
years, was that of Carterocephalus palemon, of which I came across 
a few specimens each day. I was surprised also to meet with Chry- 
sophanus hippothoé, type, and with no approach to the mountain 
form var. eurybia; the females had a fair amount of copper on 
the upper side, and the males well marked dark margins to the 
wings, and in one or two of them the inferiors are more strongly 
shot with purple than any specimens I have seen. Perhaps the 
most interesting species I took in the Tatra was a Melitea 
with the upper side as dark as M. dictynna, but which has an 
under side very suggestive of M. aurelia, which the Rev. G. 

ENTOM.—DECEMBER, 1909. JEG 


306 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Wheeler, who has seen the specimens, informs me are the 
M. var. ? dictynnoides of Horrnuzaki, included by Staudinger in 
his Catalogue as a var. of M. aurelia, but which Mr. Wheeler 
believes to be a distinct species, an opinion receiving support 
from very typical specimens of M. aurelia, taken at Tatra 
Lomnitz, for which I am indebted to Baron Vecsez. The dark 
Hungarian form of Pararge méra, which somewhat resembles P. 
hiera, butis not that species, was common and in good condition; 
Nomiades semiargus was fine and typical; Brenthis ino was found 
at rest not infrequently on the raspberry bushes; Pararge egeria 
var. egerides flew here and there, but was going over; Brenthis 
selene was still in good order; B. euphrosyne plentiful but passé. 

On July 4th I paid a visit to Count Teleki, who has a 
residence at Tatra Fured, and who is interested in entomology 
and Nature study generally. I was very kindly welcomed and 
hospitably treated by the Count, who knows the district 
thoroughly, and whom I have to thank for much useful informa- 
tion as to localities and species. On this day not much collect- 
ing was done, but Count Teleki proposed that we should take 
our nets and work a small swamp in the neighbourhood of his 
house for Cenonympha hero until lunch was ready ; only one or 
two of this species was met with, but I was delighted to find here 
the fine form of Brenthis pales var. arsilache, which was abundant 
and in fine order. 

I was anxious to try the chalk range at the eastern end of 
the Tatra, where I had been informed! that, amongst other 
species, the much-wanted Canonympha leander was to be found ; 
accordingly on the evening of this day I took a carriage and 
moved on to Tatra Hohlenhaim or, as it is more usually called, 
Barlangliget, its Hungarian name. This locality, judging from 
the flora, looks a very good one, given fine weather, but the four 
days of my stay were almost continuously dull or rainy, and I did 
not see very much, and very little indeed that was new to me. 
The only species taken here, not found at Tatra Lomnitz, were 
Lycena arion, a small but bright blue form, and one or two 
Melitea dictynna, which were quite typical. The morning of 
July 9th broke fairly cloudless, and I made an attempt to get at 
the higher-ground-frequenting species, but by the time I arrived 
at the upper edge of the forest clouds had gathered, and with the 
exception of a glint of sunshine for a few minutes, during which 
I netted two specimens of Brenthis pales, collecting was hopeless 
for the rest of the day. This form of B. pales does not appear 
to correspond with any of the named forms very closely ; the upper 
sides resemble var. arsilache in the large blotches, but the speci- 
mens are smaller than those of that form taken on the lower 
ground at Tatra Fured, whilst the under sides are quite distinct and 
resemble closely the type; I suppose they might most correctly 
be styled as intermediate between the type and var. arsilache. 


SIX WEEKS AMONGST HUNGARIAN BUTTERFLIES. 307 


On July 9th I removed my quarters to Tatra Fured, which is 
distant from Barlangliget about fifteen miles, and to get to 
which one has to go through Tatra Lomnitz. The weather 
during my stay at Tatra Fured was equally bad with that I had 
experienced elsewhere in the Tatra, and not much could be 
done. The day after my arrival, although there was some sun 
in the morning, the signs were ominous, and I could only get a 
few more Brenthis pales var. arsilache in the swamp where | had 
previously found them. Then the rain commenced to descend 
in torrents, and continued for the rest of the day. Professor 
Schmidt had told me that there was a good locality for 
Parnassius apollo var. carpathica between Tatra Fured and 
Tatra Lomnitz, about midway between the two places and on 
the left side of the road travelling from the former to the latter, 
and there being glimpses of sun on the morning of July 11th I 
made my way thither. After beating about on some foothills, 
which approach close to the road, and rise perhaps 300 ft. 
above it, I kicked up a pair of this magnificent form, one 
of which I captured ; I afterwards saw some half dozen others, 
of which two were netted. The specimens, which are all males, 
expand 88 mm. as against 78 mm., which is the average of my 
Swiss specimens, although they are not quite so large as my 
largest Albarracin Sierra example, which expands 92mm. On 
the same ground I came across Polyommatus optilete. On 
July 12th the weather broke up again, and the outlook was 
so hopeless that I felt it was no use my staying longer, and 
accordingly on the following morning I entrained for Vienna on 
my route to England. 

At Tatra Fured I again came across luminous Coleoptera of 
two forms, one of these was the apterous female of Phausis splen- 
didula which was abundant, sitting amongst the herbage on the 
roadsides in the forest; the whole of the abdomen of this sex, 
which was white in colour, was phosphorescent, and the light 
resembled that of our glowworm. The other form was the male 
of the same species, which flew slowly amongst the trees in the 
forest, the phosphorescent portion, which was only small, being 
on the under side of the abdomen ; the light, which was much less 
than in the female, was continuous, and as the flight was steady 
and in a straight line it had the appearance of an electric spark 
running along a wire. 

The species of Rhopalocera observed in the Hohe Tatra, 
thirty-three in number, were: Parnassius apollo var. carpathica, 
Apori crategi, Pieris rape, P. napi, Euchloé cardamines, Leuco- 
phasia sinapis, Gonepteryx rhamni, Melitea dictynnoides, M. dic- 
tynna, Brenthis selene, B.euphrosyne, B. pales and var. arsilache, B. 
ino, Argynnis aglaia, Aglais urtice, Huvanessa antiopa (hybernated), 
Pyrameis atalanta, Polygonia c-album, Erebia medusa vay. hippo- 
medusa, HE. ligea var. adyte, Enodia hyperanthus, Pararge mera,

A NEW BEE OF THE GENUS HABROPODA FROM 
ASSAM. 


By T. D. A. CockEeretu. 


WHEN collecting in Assam in September 1908, Mr. Rowland 
K. Turner obtained a very fine species of the genus Habropoda, 
which was recognized by the late Colonel Bingham as unde- 
scribed. The type, herewith described, will be Ieee in the 
collection of the British Museum. 


Habropoda turnert, n. sp. 


?. Length about 17 mm., anterior wing 11; robust, but with 
the abdomen much longer in proportion to its breadth than in 
H. zonatula, Sm.; black, with the pubescence of the head, and 
thorax above as far back as the level of the hind wings, black ; 
posterior to this, beginning abruptly, the pubescence is sulphur- 
yellow, and the same, very dense, covers the first two segments of 
the abdomen; the third segment has the hair short, dense and coal- 
black; the fourth and fifth have it reddish, more or less black at 
sides; there is a little pale tomentum at sides of face, and the lower 
part of the cheeks is covered with long white hair; a peculiar feature 
is a small patch of appressed white hair just above (a little mesad of) 
each antenna, surrounded on all sides by erect long black hair; the 
pleura is covered with long white hair; hair of legs mainly black, 
but some long white hair on anterior femora beneath ; brush at end 
of hind basitarsus orange-fulvous. Clypeus prominently densely 
punctured, but the punctures irregular and largely in grooves ; 
antennee black, third joint a little longer than 4+ 5; tegule black ; 
wings fuliginous, third s. m. broader than second; marginal cell 
long; hind tibize broad and flat, not produced at end, the scopa coarse 
and dense. 


Hab. Shillong, Assam. 

A very distinct species, not closely resembling any of the 
four (7H. montana, Rad., H. magrettii, Bingh., H. moelleri, 
Bingh., H. fulvipes, Cam.) known from India. There is a 
certain general resemblance to H. tarsata, but that has the hair 
of the thorax entirely orange-fulyvous above.

VARIATION IN VANESSA URTICA, L.: SEASONAL 
(CLIMATICAL) AND LOCAL VARIATION IN VJ. 
CHIC A AND? INS VCTOO Es BY “WHICH THE 
TWO SPECIES SHOW A TENDENCY TO MEET 
IN FACIKS. 

By T. Reuss. 


Variation in Vanessa urtice, L. 


Tue above figures represent the marginal markings on the 
hind wings of nine varieties—figs. 1-9—of V. urtice, L., which 
I reared this season from wild Hertfordshire larve. Fig. 10 is 
the hind wing of an aberration I bred on the 14th of August, 
1906, from wild Continental larve, and figured as ab. woproto- 
formis in the Ent. Ree. pl. vii. fig. 5, last April, without at the 
time describing the specimen. 

All the marginal markings depicted are those of female 
imagines, with two exceptions—figs. 1 and 9. The markings of 
each specimen in figs. 1-7 were otherwise, as in typical urtice, 
and the ground colour exhibited its usual variability in different 
shades of brownish, reddish, and yellowish orange. Figs. 8 and 
9 are only slightly aberrative in other details, but in fig. 10 the 
whole facies is changed. 

The width of these marginal markings, as I measured them 
across the fourth median lunule in different specimens, varied 
from 2°5 mm. in ab. pygmea, Ruhl, measuring 18 mm. along 
costa of each fore wing, to a little over 4 mm. in a giant form 
with the fore wings each measuring 28°5 mm. from base to tip. 
In medium-sized specimens the margin seems to be most often 
just under 4 mm. broad—almost as broad therefore as in the 
largest forms. 

All the margins here figured vary only very slightly in width, 
despite the differences not only in the shape and size of the 
lunules, but also in the size of the whole wings. In fig. 3 the 
large lunules narrow the outer border (which together with the 
costal lunules is typical in fig. 1), while in fig. 8 the border 
is widened and disintegrated, the original brownish suffusion 
becoming plainly visible, which (also in the other figures) links 


310 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


up the lunules in a band. In the Corsican variety ichnusa, 
Bon., the brownish suffusion often confines itself to the parts 
between the fringe and the base of the lunules, leaving the black 
triangles round the lunules separated towards the apex by the 
red ground colour. The margin consequently has a very jagged 
outline. Occasionally it appears also in British specimens. The 
opposite development is shown in fig. 2 (parvilunulata, Rynr.). 

Besides appearing in an otherwise typical facies, fig. 2, 
the margin associated itself with a fine brown ground colour. 
A specimen of this kind, which I reared in the beginning of 
last June from larve collected full-sized on May 28rd (this is 
perhaps an early date for full-grown larve of urtice in England) 
exhibited a very dark under side, with the two median puncta 
of the fore wings each marked by a deep brown blotch, in the 
Same manner as is often exhibited in the under side of another 
species, V. xanthomelas. On the upper side of the fore wings 
the puncta are large and conspicuous; the inner marginal blotch 
is, however, obsolete. I suggest for this aberration the name 
ab. subtuspuncta (female). 

Fig. 8, for which the varietal name ab. magnilunulata, Rynr., 
appears appropriate, has a yellowish ground colour, and the 
lunules are sometimes greenish. I reared three specimens of 
this variety, which were all females, and I am inclined to think 
that this form with the broad, almost trapeze-shaped blue spots 
is in truth a ‘‘female variety,’ and perhaps the same may be 
said of fig. 4. 

The ground colour of fig. 4 is brownish with shining light 
blue lunules. I have also reared this form with violet markings, 
and sometimes groups of white scales form conspicuous spots 
among the violet or blue scales of the lunules. In the ocellus 
of the hind wings in JV. io occasionally white spots or streaks 
appear in a somewhat similar manner, and three of these spots 
ave there so placed that they evidently form a continuation of 
the chain of white spots already present on the fore wings, 
which sometimes is made complete by an extra spot near the 
inner angle. 

Fig. 5, female, with crescent-shaped lunules is associated 
with a fiery red or rich orange ground colour, and all the finest 
specimens I reared were females. 

Fig. 6, female, has violet lunules, and only on one hind 
wing do the anal lunules coalesce as depicted. Fig. 1 shows a 
transitory form in a male; in transitory females no points 
protrude from the lunules, but instead they are separated by a 
narrow black line, the ‘lean to”’ of the lunules being quite diffe- 
rent. Such transitory females occur sometimes with lunules 
shaped as in fig. 2. 

In other specimens the two largest median lunules tend to 
coalesce, and on the fore wings, at the apex, broad square blue 


VARIATION IN VANESSA URTIC. SL 


spots show a similar tendency. This sort of development—very 
different from that in ab. luna (see antea, p. 228, fig. 1), which 
presents quite another aspect with its tsolated crescent—points 
out the possibility that a continuous blue band might border the 
wings. I believe that such a variety (if it does not exist 
already ?) could soon be bred by pairing some of the transitory 
specimens obtainable from wild larve. I would mention here 
that normal British V. io, male and female—as, for instance, 
they are figured from photographs in Mr. South’s ‘ Butterflies of 
the British Isles’—have a black-blue spotted margin at the apex 
of the fore wings, as in urtice, but that a variety may some- 
times be captured in which these blue spots spread and form an 
unbroken blue band with black outer border (see figures of V. io, 
2 and 3). 


Climatical (Seasonal) and Local Variation in Vane:sa io, L., and what it tends to. 


Cold induces an urtice-form facies ; heat and contrasts in temperature 
(cold nights and hot days, cold winters and hot summers), on the other hand, 
bring ocelliformity near perfection, and efface all resemblance to wrtice. 

Fig. 2, induced by comparatively cool seasons, is the normal form of 
V. vo in tie British Isles. Fig. 3, induced by hot seasons, occurs with many 
transitions to Fig. 2 as a variety in Britain, but is, on the Continent, the 
most common form in many localities, especiaily in the South, where V. io 
is often double-brooded, and is therefore often figured as typical in Conti- 
neutal butterfly books. Fig. 1is V. to ab. fischeri, Stdfss., induced by cold 
(temperature experiment representing exaggerated seasonal influence) ; it 
exhibits the ocellus disintegrated into its constituent parts, with a complete 
chain of marginal lunulés as in var. ichnusa, the local heat form of V. 
urtice. This form, obtained under such conditions, is, however, only an 
exaggerated form of Fig. 2, which latter often exhibits traces of the median 
marginal lunules, and is a common form in the field wherever the summers 
are cool and the climate generally contrastless. Fig. 3, with the perfect 
banded ocellus (as in the peacock’s feather) on the fore wings, seems to 
represent the culminating point of ocelliform development in V. 70; also 
the hind wings show a fine blue ocellus. But this latter ocellus seems still 
capable of an exaggerated development, as shown in Fig. 4, induced by 
exposure of the pup to tropical warmth for three days, in which the re- 
maining black bar is suffused with blue. This ocellus contains three small 
white spots, correlated, evidently, with those of the fore wings. For the 
latter unusual and beautiful variety (Fig. 4) I suggest the varietal name ab. 
splendens. Figs. 2, 8, and 4 were bred by me from wild Hertfordshire larvie 
last July and August. Fig. 1 was bred by Prof. Standfuss by exposing the 
pup to a low temperature (cf. Standfuss, ‘ Handbook of Palearctic Lepi- 
doptera,’ 1896). The very large local (heat) form of Sardinia, V. zo ab. 
sardoa, Staud., exhibits variation of the grownd colour instead of the ocelli. 


a2 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


The ocelli appear to be intermediate between figs. 2 and 3, the light ring 
round the ocellus of the hind wings darkens almost to the colour of the 
border (exactly as in most heat-forms bred by experiment from northern 
pup), and the dark-coloured fore wings are suffused with fulvous. Northern 
pupe of V. 0, bred in a high temperature, occasionally produce specimens 
even darker than ab. sardoa, and sometimes the ground colour is suffused 
with brown. 


This variety exhibits a much more “ peacock-like”’ ocellus 
than the normal fly, and to breed it, almost to the exclusion of 
the type, I found it usually only necessary to keep the larve and 
pup in a sunny, warm room, in which the windows must be 
kept shut against cold during the nights. On the other hand, 
not one specimen of this perfect form emerged from pup which 
I kept in a dark, sunless, comparatively cold place, though 
it appeared from other pupe which I subjected to - 38° C. three 
times during the first days of their development. ‘‘ Contrasts 
in temperature ” here take effect. In this connection I would 
suggest that almost all kinds of ‘indoor conditions,” even if 
not purposely modified, differ so essentially from “wild” con- 
ditions, that their influence may be considered sufficiently 
abnormal to help in accounting for the fact that apparently the 
imagines reared in captivity are oftener given to variation than 
in open nature. 

Fig. 7, female, has violet lunules curved and pointed like 
teeth, ‘but I have also reared specimens with blue and whitish 
‘“‘teeth.” These imagines were of both sexes, and several other 
forms intermediate between figs. 7 and 8 were all males with only 
one exception. It seems that very large lunules appear much more 

easily in the female than in the male, especially on the hind wings; 

but generally the extent of variation in the size, shape, and 
position of the lunules is in both sexes as remarkable as is also 
the variation in the colour of these markings. Grey, yellow, 
metallic white, green-blue, blue or violet in many shades—all 
these tints have appeared in the margin of urtice, and, appar- 
ently, quite independent of other facial development. Some- 
times, also, the lunules are wholly black, while another time 
they disappear altogether, and the whole hind wing is then 
fuscous, as in ab. nigra, Tutt, ab. atrebatensis, Boisd. Occasion- 
ally the lunules of the fore wings differ in colour from those of 
the hind wings in the same specimen. This is the case, for 
instance, in ab. ioprotoformis, fig. 10, the lunules of the hind 
wings being blue, those of the ‘fore wings yellowish white. 

Together with the lunules the one: borders of the wings 
also vary considerably. 

Thus in fig. 7 the costal fates are not separated by the 
usual fine black line from the outer brown border, which here 
tends to disappear, while in figs. 8 and 9 it is revealed as part 
of the brownish band in which the separate lunules ‘‘ float.” 


SOME EUROPEAN FOSSIL BEES. 313 


The orange, yellowish, or whitish suffusion at the base of the 
lunules, which is often brilliant in the type, disappears in these 
specimens altogether, the borders then reminding somewhat of 
the wing-borders in V. vo. 


(To be continued.) 


SOME EUROPEAN FOSSIL BEES. 
By TD Ay *CockeRenn. 


Wuen recently in Zurich I took the opportunity to make a 
critical examination of a number of fossil bees described by Heer 
from the Miocene of (iningen.* For every facility in this work 
I am indebted to the kindness of Professor Albert Heim, in whose 
custody the collections are. The splendid collection of fossil 
insects at the Zurich Polytechnicum would afford opportunity for 
many months of fruitful study, and it is much to be regretted 
that it has been, and is so greatly, neglected by entomologists. 


Lithurgus adamiticus (Heer). 


Apis adamitica, Heer, Foss. Hym. aus GEningen und Radoboj, 
p. 4, taf. III. fig. 11. Urwelt der Schweiz, f. 287. 


This was described, and has since been cited by authors, as 
a veritable Apis, closely related to the living honey-bee. An 
examination of the type shows that the resemblance to Apis 
is merely superficial, and, so far as can be seen, the insect 
essentially agrees with Lithurgus. The shape of the abdomen 
accords well with female Lithurgus: the abdomen is a little over 
8 mm. long, 4 broad, truncate basally, pointed apically, as pre- 
served warm red-brown with the first three sutures colourless ; 
Heer's figure of the first segment shows the Lithurgus-like form. 
The thorax is short, of the same colour as the abdomen ; the legs 
are not visible. The wings seem short for the size of the insect; 
the venation is only partly preserved. Marginal cell relatively 
short, pointed, the end symmetrical, not approaching apex of 
wing; all this exactly as in Lithurgus, and different from Apis, 
or even Megachile, the latter having the cell much more obtuse. 
Stigma slightly developed, as in Lithurgus, the part projecting 
over the marginal cell short, herein like L. atratiformis, Ckll.t 
Basal nervure hardly deflected at the junction of the two sections, 
and with the upper section relatively long; all this as in L. 
atratiformis, and contrasting with the European L. fuscipennis. 


* The fossil-beds, cited in all the literature as of Giningen, are actually 
on the hill above Wangen, and some distance from Giningen. My wife and I 
visited the place, and collected a series of fossils, but did not obtain any bees. 
+ Specimens from Tahiti compared. 


314 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


Basal nervure to base of marginal cell about equal to half length 
of cell. At first sight one seems to see indications of a third sub- 
marginal cell, as figured by Heer, but this is illusory, and is 
negatived also by the fact that the broad second submarginal 
receives both the recurrent nervures, the first very near the base, 
the second some distance from the apex ; this differs a little from 
modern Lithurgus, in which the second recurrent is received 
nearer the apex. The shape of the second submarginal cell also 
differs from that in living Lithurgus, in that it is less constricted 
above, the second transverso-cubital nervure going more directly 
to the marginal. Basal nervure meeting the transverso-medial 
a little on the apicad side; it falls distinctly short of it in 
modern Lithurgus. 

All things considered, therefore, the Giningen bee must be 
placed in Lithurgus, with the remark that it is somewhat less 
modified or specialized in venation than the living species. It 
might possibly be justifiable to distinguish it sub-generically. 
In Prussian amber, of Oligocene age, there are two extinct 
genera of bees possessing only two submarginal cells, and pro- 
bably referable to a group from which the Megachiloids (includ- 
ing Lithurgus) sprung. Glyptapis mirabilis, Ckll., has a venation 
not very unlike that of Lithurgus adamiticus, but the stigma is 
relatively long and narrow. This is, however, a little black bee, 
slightly over 5 mm. long, with hairy eyes, mandibles with a broad 
cutting edge notched near the apex, metathorax divided by ridges 
into large subquadrangular areas. The hairy eyes of Glyptapis 
are especially interesting, because this character exists to-day in 
the parasitic Megachiloid genus Celioxys. (In the African * 
C’. decipiens, Spin., the eyes are naked however.) In the other 
amber genus referred to the eyes are bare. Ctenoplectrella 
viridiceps, Ckll., is a small stout bee like Glyptapis, hardly 
5mm. long, claws strongly cleft, pulvillus large, malar space 
very short, wings dark rufo-fuliginous, stigma large, second sub- 
marginal cell receiving first recurrent nervure some distance 
from base, and second not far from apex. These amber bees, 
and many others which I have described, are in the museum at 
Konigsberg, where a full account of them is in process of publica- 
tion. All of the Prussian amber bees, so far as seen by me, are 
of extinct genera; but the Miocene bees, whether of EHurope or 
America, include various living genera. 


Xylocopa abavus (Heer). 


The ‘‘type”’ is a bee with a broad thorax; no head or 
abdomen visible, and the venation cannot be made out. ‘The 
legs show a scopa, and the hind tibia is very broad, with a 
gently curved longitudinal ridge visible on both sides, and, 


* Specimen from Willowmore, Cape Colony (Brawns). 


SOME EUROPEAN FOSSIL BEES. 315 


therefore, certainly natural. This ridge is normal for Xylocopa, 
to which the Bombus abavus, Heer (tom. cit., p. 5), must appa- 
rently be referred. The only doubt arises from Heer’s figure, 
which represents a similar-looking object, but with head and 
abdomen. The Zurich specimen may therefore not be the true 
type. 

Another Xylocopa (X. senilis, Heer) has been described from 
Giningen. The type appears to be at Carlsruhe, and I did not 
see it. 

Xylocopa jurinet (Heer). 
Bombus jurinei, Heer, tom. cit., p. 4, taf. ILI. fig. 8. 


The type is a very large and stout-bodied bee, like a Bombus. 
Head lacking, abdomen 12 mm. wide, hind legs with a coarse 
scopa, marginal cell with a dark cloud. Only part of the 
venation can be made out, but all that can be seen agrees with 
Xylocopa, and not with Bombus. The second recurrent nervure 
can be seen entering the third submarginal cell far from its end, 
and the shape of the cell (base and extreme apex not visible) is 
as in Xylocopa. ‘The lower side of the cell is arched before the 
insertion of the recurrent nervures, as in X. violacea. The 
apical part of the second discoidal cell can also be seen, exactly 
as in Xylocopa. There is also visible a considerable part of the 
venation of the hind wing, showing the transverso-cubital, and 
the ends of the marginal and cubital nervures, quite as in 
A ylocopa. 

Anthophorites titania (Heer). 

Scutellum broad and flat; mesothorax rather small; meta- 
thorax with apparently a sharp edge separating base from apical 
truncation; head absent; first abdominal segment narrowed 
basally, the abdomen broadest at middle of third segment; 
stigma narrow, rather well-developed; upper section of basal 
nervure shorter than lower; marginal cell sharply pointed, 
rather broad basally ; rest of venation cannot be made out. 

The specimen here described is supposed to be the type, but 
it is evidently not the one figured by Heer. The species was 
described from two specimens from (iningen in the Carlsruhe 
collection; perhaps the one now at Zurich is one of them. The 
genus Anthophorites cannot be precisely defined, but includes 
various fossil bees supposed to be more or less similar to 
Anthophora. I herewith designate Heer’s first species, A. mellona, 
as the type. 

The generic position of A. titania, at least as exemplified by 
the Zurich specimen, remains obscure. 


Anthophorites longeva, Heer. 
2. Clearly a bee; eyes large; face narrow; middle joints 
of the rather stout flagellum a little longer than broad; abdo- 


316 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


men with fine hair, and broad at base, not at all like the 
specimen of A. titania; hind tibia 83 mm., hind basitarsus 
about 24 mm.; hind basitarsus broadened; venation cannot be 
made out. The generic position of this specimen must remain 
wholly obscure. 

A. longeva was based on two specimens, which, judging from 
Heer’s figures, are probably not even congeneric. The specimen 
above described is from Ciningen, but Heer’s first one, from 
Radoboj, must be considered the true type. 


“* Osmia.”’ 


In 1849 Heer published Osmia antiqua from (Hningen. This 
was a poorly preserved insect, which cannot apparently be re- 
ferred to Osmia or any other genus with certainty. In Heer’s 
work, translated and edited by Heywood, ‘The Primeval World 
of Switzerland’ (1876), vol. ii. p. 48, I find a statement that 
there were three species of Osmia at CHningen. In the collection 
at Zurich I find three species from that locality, bearing manu- 
script names by Heer. One of these, an insect about 9} mm. 
long, the abdomen almost 6 mm., shows no venation, and is 
worthless for descriptive purposes. One is a wasp. The third 
may be described as follows :— 


vV Andrena (7) primeva, n. sp. 2. 

Osmia primeva, Heer, MS. A medium-sized species, with broad 
subglobose abdomen, clearly a bee. Thorax small; hind legs pre- 
served, showing scopa; three submarginal cells. 

The hind legs are robust, formed as in Andrena, except that the 
broad hind femur is swollen above at base ; this condition is, how- 
ever, distinctly approached in some species of Andrena. The tibia 
and broad basitarsus, the latter showing much long hair along its 
hind margin, are exactly as in Andrena. The middle basitarsus is a 
little longer than the small tibia, and is quite broad, narrowing some- 
what toward the base. The form of this basitarsus is rather unusual, 
but finds a close parallel in A. hattorfiana (Fabr.). 

The venation, so far as visible, is as follows: stigma long and 
well-developed, quite normal for Andrena: marginal cell quite normal, 
the apex narrowly rounded, just away from costa, as in A. morio ; 
second submarginal cell approximately square, receiving the first 
recurrent neryure about the middle, as in A. errans; third sub- 
marginal cell fully twice length of second, but about equally broad 
on marginal, receiving the second recurrent nervure just before 
the beginning of the last third; third transverso-cubital with a 
single curve, not at all angulate ; ‘second recurrent nervure normal 
in form. 

The relatively long third submarginal cell suggests Noma, but 
occurs also in Andrena, e.g. A. albicans. In the hind wing the 
marginal, cubital, and transverso-cubital nervures are visible, entirely 
as in Andrena. The transverso-cubital is a little oblique, the lower 
end most basad. 


NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS. SA; 


All things considered, the reference to Andrena seems reasonably 
assured,

Apis mellifera (L.). 

In the Museum of Cambridge University is a piece of amber 
from the coast off Yarmouth, containing two specimens of 
genuine Apis mellifera, side by side. As preserved, the eyes and 
ocelli are a fine crimson, evidently from the eye-pigment, and 
the face and front are a deep metallic reddish, perhaps from 
a suffusion of the same substance. The basal nervure can be 
seen falling far short of the transverso-medial, and the other 
characters of the venation, legs, &amp;c., agree with the honey-bee. 
The amber, as the museum records show, was purchased in the 
rough by Benjamin Burwood from fishermen in or near Great 
Yarmouth. The bees, and other amber insects from the same 
source, were crudely figured by A. §. Foord in Trans. Norf. and 
Norw. Nat. Soe. vol. v. pt. 1 (1890). The other specimens, also 
now in the Cambridge Museum, include Coleoptera and Diptera, 
and a cockroach labelled Blatta orientalis, but evidently not that 
species, and apparently not identical with any living British 
form. It is well preserved, and should be studied by a specialist 
in these insects. 

Conwentz has given a full discussion of English amber in 
‘Natural Science,’ 1896. Its age has not been precisely ascer- 
tained, but if the specimen containing honey-bees is authentic, 
it must be Pliocene at the oldest, and cannot possibly have any- 
thing to do with the true Baltic amber of Oligocene age. Con- 
wentz remarks, however, that much of the succinite in shops at 
Cromer is imported from abroad in order to satisfy the demand 
of visitors to the seaside, and from the appearance of the piece 
containing Apis, I cannot help suspecting that it is really copal, 
and not of English origin at all. Some of the pieces containing 
beetles seem to be genuine, however, and these should be eriti- 
cally examined.

PuPATION OF XANTHORHOE (MELANIPPE) FLUCTUATA.—It has 
been stated that the larva of X. /luctuata having made its frail, under- 
ground cocoon, postpones the pupal change for a rather long time, 
perhaps even the entire winter. Some larve of this species that I 
reared last September—October, in a glass tumbler with a little earth 
at the bottom, formed their cocoons in the soil but against the glass. 
This method of construction enabled me to see the larva in its cell,

the glass, serving as a window, being only slightly obscured by the 
flimsy silk lining spun over it. In the three cases where direct 
observation was possible, the pupa was formed in six to seven days 
after the larva had fashioned its habitation—RicHarp SoutH. 


A. PAPHIA var. VALESINA.—Of seventy-seven specimens of Ar- 
gynus paphia bred this year from ova obtained from a New Forest 
specimen of valesina (male unknown), forty-one emerged type males, 
twenty-three type females, thirteen var. valesina. Unfortunately I 
was unsuccessful in obtaining a pairing, as it would be interesting 
to know what percentage of valesina would be produced when the 
male was bred from a valesina parent.—H. C. Joy: 2, St, Kilda’s 
Road, Stoke Newington, London, W. 


ABERRATION OF ARCTIA CaIA.—A striking aberration of Arctia 
caia was bred from a larva (found by her near her house) by Mrs. 
Gilbert Humphry, of West Wittering, near Chichester, in July last. 
The specimen is asymmetrical. The right fore wing is almost 
entirely brown, whilst the left has the markings clearly indicated. 
The hind wings are of a unicolorous dark shade, though the dark 
spots are visible. The moth much resembles the specimen (No. 3) 
figured in Newman’s ‘ History of British Moths.’—JosppH ANDER- 
son; Chichester. 


ACIDALIA DEGENERARIA.—In connection with the note on this 
moth (‘ Entomologist,’ antea, p. 280), perhaps the following remarks 
on its occurrence in the Isle of Portland many years ago may 
be of interest :—‘ 1854, from July 2nd to the 11th twenty- -four 
specimens were taken by myself and thirty-five by the late Mr. 
Frederick Bond. By the 11th of July they had become worn and 
shabby. In the following year, 1855, from July 3rd to 25th, one 
hundred and forty-four were taken by myself, and thirty-six by my 
cousin (the late Rev. H. Adair Pickard). By the 11th of July, in 
this year, the moth had, as in the previous year, become worn and 
shabby, but suddenly, just after that date, an entirely fresh brood 
appeared to have come out, and the greater number of the hundred 
and forty-four I obtained were from that time to July 25th, when 
the specimens were still in fair condition. I noticed particularly that 
the purplish bands in this second brood were, as a rule, of a more 
dull and dusky hue than in the first; though in the first brood the 
brightest coloured and largest specimens occurred.’’—O. Pickarp- 
CAMBRIDGE ; Bloxworth Rectory, November 17th, 1909. 


THE CuarK CouuEection.—The first portion of the collection of 
British Lepidoptera formed by the late Mr. J. A. Clark was dispersed 
at auction at Stevens’s Rooms on Tuesday and Wednesday, Novem- 
ber 2nd and 3rd. The specimens were, as a rule, in good condition, 
but, except in the case of good varieties or rare species, generally 
without data. Competition for the better lots was keen, several of 
those present at the sale evidently being bent upon securing some of 
the more unusual forms, in which the collection was particularly 
rich, with the result that the two days’ sale realized a total of approxi- 
mately four hundred pounds. Among the more important lots,

Lycena egon, with others, at £1 1s.; two rather worn L. icarus at 
13s. and 11s. respectively ; and a small but fine Cyaniris argiolus 
at £6. 

Among the varieties of moths the highest price obtained was £15 
for a fine female specimen of Saturnia carpini of a uniform brownish 
black colour, with the ocelli showing still darker, which was taken 
by the late Mr. J. A. Clark at Tunbridge Wells on June 3rd, 1878. A 
black Dicranura vinula bred from a larva found on Hackney Marshes 
realized £7 15s.; a nice light Asphalia ridens, £1; and an | VI female

number of Arctia catia, one of which having the fore wings almost 
entirely brown, and the hind wings with broadly confluent black 
markings, sold for £9, and another somewhat similar for £8 8s., while 
others also put up singly or grouped with one or two specimens of 
lesser note fetched £6, £5 10s., £3 10s., £3 7s. 6d., £3, and so on 
down to a few shillings a lot; and a nice light variety of A. villica

entirely dark brown dusted with yellow, £4. Among the rare and 
extinct species, Chrysophanus dispar brought £7 10s. for a large 
richly coloured male, and £6 10s. for a fine large female, while other 
specimens in good order ranged from £4 4s. to £3. Lycena acis 
went for from 6s. to 14s. a pair, the higher price named being for a 
lot in which the female was said to have been taken at Deal in 1879. 
Lelia cenosa, in good condition, realized from £1 Is. to £1 15s. a 
pair; Gastropacha wllicifolia, 7s. to £1 each, and one “bred 21st May,

brought £2.5s. the lot; and four specimens of Xylina zinckenit 
from 18s. to £1 4s. each. Ten specimens of Cleora viduaria put up 
singly realized from 10s. to £1 10s. each, with an average price of 
just over 16s. 6d., and three fine examples of Boletobia fuliginaria 
captured by the late Mr. J. A. Clark, two in Lower East Smithfield, 
and one in St. Katherine’s Docks, just £2 2s. each after a keen com- 
petition.—R. A. 


THe Barker Couiuection. — Yet another collection of British 
Lepidoptera, but of smaller size, has come under the hammer, that 
formed by the late Mr. H. W. Barker being disposed of at Stevens’s 
Auction Rooms on November 16th. There were few really interesting 
lots, but among the more noteworthy a fine Lycena adonis female, 
with splashes of male colour in left fore wing, brought £3 15s.; a 
male L. corydon, under side very near var. obsoleta, with a nice blue 
shot female, £1 the pair; a fine male Nemeophila russula, with hind

mination, pup of S. mendica and its (Irish) var. rustica.—L. Don- 
cASTER; Zoological Laboratory, University, Birmingham. 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. 


ABUNDANCE OF PIERIS BRASSICH.— Following on Mr. Joseph 
Anderson’s note on this species (antea, p. 282), it may be of interest 
to mention that Prerzs brassice began to be seen in goodly numbers 
about the gardens in Eastbourne and on the railway-banks on the way 
to London about Aug. 12th, and from that time it became more and 
more common until about the 22nd of that month, whenit was met with 
in unusual abundance not only in the town, but on any sheltered parts 
of the downs where there were any flowers to attract it. It then 
gradually diminished in numbers until, by the beginning of October, 
only an occasional specimen was to be seen. I did not observe any 
concerted movement on the part of the butterflies, nor was it a case 
of the sudden appearance of large numbers as has been observed 
under the influence of migration, but just a gradually increasing 
number of individuals quite compatible with the natural development 
of unusually large broods. By the end of September full-fed larve 
also were frequently seen wandering in search of suitable places for 
pupation, and not a few found their way in at the windows of the 
house where I was staying, although there was no adjacent cabbage- 
garden, and spun up on the walls and ceilings of the rooms; and 
little bunches of yellow ichneumon cocoons, as well as healthy pupe, 
were not infrequently seen under the copings of walls in the neigh- 
bourhood.—Rosertr Apkin; Lewisham, November, 1909. 


CAPTURES AND FIELD REPORTS. BP 


OCNERIA DISPAR AT HAsTBoURNE.—On the evening of August 
30th last, on my way home from the train, I captured a female 
Ocneria dispar from the trunk of an elm-tree, where it was resting 
in an apparently torpid condition. It is an unusually large 
specimen, measuring 74 mm. from tip to tip of the wings, and is 
somewhat greyer in colour than usual, possibly owing to the loss of 
wing-scales, although the fringes are in fairly perfect condition. The 
situation where it was taken is an unlikely one for the species to 
have bred wild in the immediate neighbourhood, nor has the speci- 
men the appearance of one that had been reared in captivity ; there 
should, however, be no difficulty in this latter point being set at 
rest.—RoBERT ADKIN. 


CoLIAS EDUSA AT HasTBouRNE.— Although frequently over the 
most likely spots in the neighbourhood of Eastbourne during the 
months of August and September last, the only example of Colias 
edusa that came under my notice was a travel-stained male captured 
by a friend on the morning of September 17th. The species cannot 
have been common in Britain during the past autumn, but probably 
some few specimens may have been noted, and it would be interest- 
ing if all such cases were put on record, with particulars of date 
when met with, and sex and condition of the specimens where 
known.—RoBert ADKIN. 


Sravropus FaGci.—As the “lobster moth” seems to be still of 
unfrequent occurrence, it is perhaps worth while to record a male 
taken by myself early in June last; it was on a pane of my study 
window, and perfectly quiet. In my present crippled condition I had 
some difficulty in securing it, but first and last it never moved, and 
had apparently never flown; no bred specimen could be in finer 
condition. The only perfect insect of this species I have ever before 
taken here was a female, on the trunk of an oak many years ago; 
though from the year 1852 at various considerable intervals of 
time up to now I have met with the larva, but never succeeded in 
getting a perfect insect; the result having always been that the 
larva either died after changing to a chrysalis, or else produced 
an ‘ichneumon.’’—QO. PicKARD-CAMBRIDGE; Bloxworth Rectory, 
November 17th, 1909. 


ABUNDANCE OF THE LARV# OF PIERIs BRASSICH.— With reference 
to Mr. Joseph Anderson’s note (antea, p. 282) on the extraordinary 
abundance of the larve of P. brassice in the neighbourhood of 
Chichester, I should like to record their equal abundance in this 
district, for most of the plants of broccoli, Brussels sprouts, savoys, 
&amp;c., in the gardens about here present the same melancholy spectacle 
of bare stalks, and the palings and walls adjacent are covered with 
their chrysalids, and the yellow nests of cocoons of Apanteles glome- 
ratus; and there are still quantities of larvee to be seen on the plants, 
or crawling about the walls looking for sheltered corners wherein to 
pupate, notwithstanding the severe frosts, snow, and hail we have 
experienced during the last week. I did not notice that the perfect 
insects were in any way more numerous than usual at the end of

$29 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


July or in August.—Gerrvase F. Marnuew; Dovercourt, Essex, 
November 17th, 1909. 


Scarcity oF VANEssIps.—One of the peculiarities of the past 
remarkable season has been the dearth of the Vanessids. Hybernated 
specimens of zo were tolerably plentiful in the spring, and a fair 
number of fresh examples appeared in August, but of the other 
species I have not seen more than half a dozen atalanta, and about 
a dozen wrtice, either in this district or in the neighnourhood of 
Instow, North Devon, where I spent the latter part of June and 
most of July. Cardui or polychloros I never saw at all, nor did I 
observe any nests of larve of either 20 or wrtvce.— GERVASE F. 
MATHEW. 


Nore on VANESSA 10.—With reference to Mr. F. W. Frohawk’s 
note (antea, p. 260), the recent abundance of Vanessa 20, to which he 
calls attention, must have been partial and not general throughout 
the country. In this neighbourhood the insect has, in my experi- 
ence, been no commoner than usual this season, in explanation of 
which statement it may be added that I rarely, if ever, set eyes on 
half a dozen specimens, and sometimes see none at all, in the course 
of a single year!— Eustace R. Bankes; Norden, Corfe Castle, 
November 17th, 1909. 


SrREX NOCTILIO AND §. GIGAS AT CHICHESTER.—A female Sirex 
noctilio was taken in the kitchen of the Rev. R. Codrington, The 
Close, Chichester, on September 14th of this year, where its intrusion 
created some dismay amongst the domestics. The treatment to 
which it was subjected in consequence had not improved its condi- 
tion when it reached my hands. On the 26th of the same month a 
Sirex gigas was captured in the neighbourhood.—JosEPH ANDERSON. 


CHARHAS GRAMINIS IN 8. Watzs, 1909.—There has been a plague 
of graminis larve on the hill pastures of this district this year. At 
the end of May and the early part of June the nearly full-grown 
larvee were crawling over the ground in thousands, and several 
farmers complained to me of the damage they were doing to the 
pastures. About the middle of July I found great flocks of crows 
and other birds were frequenting the hills, attracted by the abundance 
of pupe and full-fed larve. The grass and other plants were pulled 
up by the birds in their search, and after observing their modus 
operandi I entered into competition with them, and in less than two 
hours had obtainéd on a small area of ground over three hundred 
pupe. On pulling up a tuft of withered grass which showed signs 
of having harboured the larvee, I sometimes shook out as many as 
six, eight, or ten pups at a time. When the date came for the moths 
to emerge I found many had been ichneumoned, but I obtained a 
very nice lot of insects. I understand that some parts of Glamorgan 
had a similar visitation in 1884.—G. Fiemine; 9, Fairview Terrace, 
Merthyr Tydfil, October 5th, 1909. 


LEUCANIA L-ALBUM AT HastBourNE.—On October 14th I took a 
female example of the above-named species at ivy, which has since 
laid a few ova. I have worked the same locality every suitable

evening since, with no further suecess.—Epwin P. SHarp; 1, Bedford 
Well Road,*Eastbourne, October 26th, 1909. 


L. FAvICoLOR IN SussEx.-—During the summer of 1908 I took a 
specimen of this insect in East Sussex (exact locality suppressed for 
obvious reasons). It was not till a recent meeting of the South 
London Entomological Society that the specimen was identified as 
the species named, although I personally had no doubt of its identity. 
The specimen (almost var. lutea) is now in the collection of Mr. A. E. 
Gibbs, St. Albans, who kindly got it identified for me.—W. JaRvIs ; 
73, Murchison Road, Leyton, N.E., October 26th, 1909. 


Note on THE Pupa oF NONAGRIA GEMINIPUNCTA. — I notice 
(antea, p. 260) that Mr. Vinall mentions finding nine pup of 
N. geminipuncta in one reed. It may be interesting to note that, 
in Kent, I once found five pup between two nodes of one reed- 
stem.— H. M. Epensten; Forty Hill, Enfield, Middlesex, October 
26th, 1909. 


Larv# oF HApENA pIst oN Boa-MyrtiEe.—Referring to Prof. 
Meldola’s note (antea, p. 284), I may say that the larve of this 
species are also common on bog-myrtle in the New Forest, especially 
on the open bogs near the railway line at Holmsley, and I have also 
found them in the vicinity on bracken occasionally. The species 
occurs in this district, and I found one larva feeding on gooseberry 
leaves in my garden, but it does not appear to be common here- 
abouts.—C. Nicnonson; 35, The Avenue, Hale End, Chingford. 


Vanessa Io ann GonEePpTERYX Raamyi.—Mr. F. W. Frohawk 
calls attention to the great abundance of the former species in 8. H. 
Hssex. I have been astonished at the abundance in this district, as 
for years [have not seen many. G.rhamni has been unusually plenti- 
ful here.—H. Everett; Letchworth. 


ABUNDANCE OF Larva&amp;.—Larve of Triphena pronuba are in enor- 
mous numbers in the garden here this autumn, feeding on almost 
everything. I have never seen them so abundant. Perhaps other 
entomologists may have noticed the same thing.—H. M. EpEnstrsn. 


Lyc&amp;NA CORYDON IN DeEvonsHIRE.—With regard to my former 
note (antea, p. 211) on the occurrence of Lycena corydon in Devon, 
this further information may be of interest. On August 13th last I 
visited the same spot where I took one male corydon last year, and 
caught three males, though I only stayed about half an hour; 
all appeared quite fresh. I had no time to search for females, and 
was unfortunately prevented from paying another visit to the place. 
However, I think it safe to assume that those three males were not 
stragglers, but that there is a colony of the species in that locality 
(which is on the slopes above the sea, about two and a half miles 
west of Bear Head). I may add that on the bank where I took the 
specimens referred to, the horseshoe vetch (H. comosd), which I 
believe is one of the food-plants, grows abundantly, and this plant also 
supports there a flourishing colony of the beautiful L. adonis.—F. L. 
Buatuwayt; 1, Stonefield Avenue, Lincoln, August 26th, 1909.

Entomouogican Society or Lonpon.— Wednesday, October 20th, 
1909.—Dr. F. A. Dixey, M.A., M.D., President, in the chair.—Mr. 
Alfred Newstead, of the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, was elected a 
Fellow of the Society——The Secretary announced that Mr. G. T. 
Bethune-Baker and Dr. Malcolm Burr had been elected members of 
the Council in the place of Mr. G. A. K. Marshall, and Mr. R. 
Shelford, resigned.—Mr. W. G. Sheldon exhibited series of the butter- 
flies collected by him at Budapest and Herculesbad during the past 
summer, including Chrysophanus dispar, var. rutilus, C. aleiphron, 
C. thersamon ; Pleberus argyrognomon, Polyommatus orion, gen. vern. 
ornata ; Melitea trivia ; Brenthis hecate; and Pyrgus orbifer.—The 
Rey. G. Wheeler brought for exhibition series of butterflies taken by 
him this year in Central Italy. They included a very fine aberration 
of Melanargia galatea, the left upper wings almost entirely black ; 
the right side much coloured ; and examples of Agriades thetis (bellar- 
gus) var. polonus, Zll., from Assisii—Mr. J. W. Tutt gave instances 
of the occurrence of var. polonus, stating that he had himself found 
it at Cuxton, Kent, where it flew in company with A. thetis, and is 
undoubtedly a hybrid between that species and A. corydon, the geni- 
talia being similar, and the food-plants identical—Mr. G. Talbot 
showed a remarkable new Lycenid butterfly from the Cameroons— 
now in the collection of Mr. W. J. Adams—probably constituting a 
new genus. The neuration most resembles that of the genus Aslauga, 
Kirby, but varies chiefly in the different place of origin of the sub- 
costal nervures of the fore wing, and in the scalloped margin of the 
hind wing.—Mr. J. W. Tutt exhibited examples of Spzlosoma mendica 
bred by Dr. Chapman from the ova found at Hyéres, Var., the females 
mostly normal, but some with a well-defined black border round all 
the wings.—Mr. W. J. Kaye exhibited series of the two species of 
Heliconius—H. chestertonit and H. weymert from Western Colombia. 
The series of H. weymeri included beautiful transitional forms to the 
aberration gustavi in which all trace of the fore wing markings had 
vanished. He said that probably there was some common influence 
at work to produce a black fore wing, as this phenomenon was found 
in several other species of Heliconius from Colombia, particularly in 
the Canea Valley. Heliconius doris in both its red and blue hind 
winged forms produced black fore wing aberrations known as abtecta. 
Heliconius ismenius also occasionally produced much darkened fore- 
wings.—Dr. T. A. Chapman gave the results of some temperature 
experiments made by him upon the larve of Preris brassice. Some 
at 56° Fahr. took four or five or even more days to pupate. Others 
at 86° had all pupated in forty-eight hours in each lot so treated. 
The pupation of a number seemed to be so accelerated that they had 
not time to make their suspension complete or correctly, and of these 
not a few did not pupate satisfactorily; the girth catching them in 
an awkward place, or the larval skin unsuccessfully passing it, &amp;c. 
After sixteen days there is no sign of any of these making an autumn 
emergence, though, of the hundreds of ichneumons—Apanteles glo- 
meratus—a few dozens came out at the end of eight or nine days 
from capture of larve; or eight from escape of ichneumon larve

Odontoscelis dorsalis, Fabr., taken at the roots of Hrodiwm on June 
21st last, in the neighbourhood of Lowestoft, Suffolk. This is the 
first record of the species occurring in Britain.—Professor T. Hudson 
Beare exhibited a specimen of Cryptamorpha desjardinst, Guér., taken 
by Mr. J. Taylor, of Sandown, I.W.,in a bunch of bananas, on 
August 30th last.—Mr. H. St. J. Donisthorpe exhibited examples of 
Chetocnema arida, Foudras, a species of Coleoptera new to Britain, 
taken near Ryde, August 26th, 1909 ; and varieties of Cassida nobilis 
(also exhibited by Mr. J. W. H. Dollman), from St. Helens, I.W., 
August 1909.—Mr. Donisthorpe also showed two examples of Formica 
sanguinea, Latr.,one being half male half hermaphrodite, and the other 
half male half female, taken in Bewdley Forest in July; and of one 
example of Myrmica scabrinodis, Nyl., half male half hermaphrodite, 
taken by Mr. Dollman at Ditchling, in September last.—Dr. T. A. 
Chapman, M.D., F.Z.5., communicated a further series of photo- 
graphs and ‘Notes on the Ancillary Appendages of Species of 
Plebeius, to illustrate the Relationships of Pleberws argus (@gon).”’-—

Two Remarkable Forms of Mantid Oothece.’’—Mr. C. T. Pead com- 
municated ‘‘ Notes on Some Rare or Little-known South African 
Homoptera,” with examples of the several species—Mr. W. F. H. 
Rosenberg then read a ‘‘ Note on the Liability of Butterflies to Attacks 
by Birds and Lizards,’ being an account of his observations in 
Colombia and Ecuador on the subject treated in Mr. G. A. K. 
Marshall’s paper recently published in the Society’s ‘‘ Transactions.” 
Mr. Marshall congratulated Mr. Rosenberg on his extremely interest- 
ing remarks, and said that he had been endeavouring to stimulate 
entomologists in the Tropics to make observations on the behaviour 
of birds, &amp;c., towards butterflies by sending copies of his paper to 
them.—The President, Mr. G. C. Champion, Mr. J. W. Tutt, Dr.

WE have received the first part of this work from M. Culot, and 
have much pleasure in bringing it to the attention alike of British 
collectors and of those interested in the more extended fauna of the 
Continent of Europe. The work owes its inspiration to M. Charles 
Oberthiir, of Rennes, who has already done so much splendid work 
in figuring the Lepidoptera of the world; and is intended to provide 
a reliable and accurate guide to all the Heterocera included in the 
groups under review. As scientific handbooks, there is no doubt that 
contemporary German works leave much to be desired in the matter 
of detailed accuracy of the plates. Produced at popular prices, it is 
inevitable that the figures should be lacking in that refinement and 
minute fidelity to the model which alone ensure successful identifi- 
cation of the more perplexing and difficult genera. The processes 
adopted by the publishers allow little scope for the artist: the often 
subtle superficial differences of allied species are not seldom wholly 
lost. As M. Oberthiir says in his charming preface, the ideal illus- 
trator is the entomologist who is also a highly skilled artist, assisted 
in the reproduction of his work by the best machinery at the disposal 
of the printer. M. Culot, whose art is familiar to all Conti- 
nental entomologists, most happily unites these qualifications, and 
the two plates before us, plate i. of Noctuas, Acronyctas, &amp;c., and 
plate i. of Geometers (‘‘Emeralds’’) are the dernier cri of hand- 
colour engraving. M. Oberthiir believes that not a few of his com- 
patriots are deterred from extending their entomological researches 
into the Heterocera by reason of the difficulties experienced by 
collectors in getting their captures named and classified. ‘‘ There is, 
however,” he proceeds to say, ‘a fortunate country where such com- 
plaints have no raison détre, and that is England. Entomology 
flourishes there; and entomologists are ever growing more active in 
the field, and more numerous.”” We have the monographs of Charles 
Barrett and Mr. J. W. Tutt, he points out, affording abundant 
material for the student, while many public collections are open to

students. Yet, though fully appreciating the illustrations of the late 
Charles Barrett’s great work on British Lepidoptera, we are bound 
to confess that, with the facilities now afforded M. Culot, a very 
much higher degree of excellence would have been attained, while 
Mr. Tutt, of course, has barely touched the subject of this mono- 
graph, and his later volumes have not the advantage of coloured illus- 
trations. We can, therefore, the more confidently recommend the 
method adopted by M. Culot, which relies less upon highly technical 
and meticulous descriptions than colour presentations to record 
individual characters, and cordially advise those of our readers who 
are interested in the subject to apply for full and further particulars 
from the author and illustrator, Villa-les-Iris, Grand Pré, Geneva.

Butterflies and Moths of the United Kingdom. By W. Eamont 
Kirpy, M.D. Pp. ili. and 2-468. With seventy coloured 
plates. Medium 8vo. London: George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd. 


In these days of general entomological progress, one expects that 
the latest book on the lepidopterous fauna of a country should, as its 
raison d’étre, exhibit either distinctive features in illustration, or some 
novel method of presenting the subject. The introduction of some 
coloured figures of larvee among those of the imagines on the plates, 
as has been done in the inexpensive volume before us, is certainly a 
welcome innovation that will appeal to the nature lover for whom, 
chiefly, the book has been produced. 

A specimen, and occasionally a variety, of very nearly every 
species of moth and butterfly (Macro-Lepidoptera old style) occurring 
in the United Kingdom may be found on the coloured plates. Some of 
the ‘“‘Micros”’ also are depicted (Plates lxv.Iyx.). It would not perhaps 
have lessened the practical utility of the book if some at least of the 
latter had not been given. For example, the figures on plate Ixvi. are 
all wrongly named in the text, also in the list of plates and in the 
index. Twenty-seven species are represented on this plate, and the 
numbering runs from 1 to 18, then 32 to 40. In the list the numbers 
for this plate run from 1 to 27, and according to it, and to the text, 
fig. 1 shows Botys lwpulina, but this species is really fig. 32 on the 
plate. Figs. 36 and 37 seem to be B. ruralis and 6. lancealis 
respectively, but text and list indicate figs. 5 and 6 as these species. 

Although very many of the plates are distinctly good, others can 
only be referred to as medium. On the whole, however, the number 
of figures that are really unsatisfactory is not excessive. 

Turning to the text, we are bound to say that we fail to find very little 
that will be new to the student of British Lepidoptera. The imago 
and the larva of each species are more or less briefly described, but 
we think that variation of the imago, especially of polymorphic 
species, should have been treated more fully. Distribution, too, is of 
greater importance, even to the tyro, than our author seems to 
consider it. 

We wonder why Salmacis and Artaxerzes are set down as species 
distinct from Polyommatus alexis, Scop. (Lycena astrarche), whilst 
Cidaria ammanata is figured as a form of C. truncata and not even 
mentioned in the text.

328 THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 


The recent addition to the list of British Lepidoptera—Anthro- 
cera (Zygena) achillee—is figured and described, but we cannot 
trace anything concerning Leucania favicolor, Barr.; we have also 
looked in vain for Aczdalia humiliata. Catocala electa was possibly 
rejected as an alien, but some other species accepted by our author— 
Plusia chaleitis, Esp., for instance—are certainly not native in any 
part of the United Kingdom. 

The book is liberally supplied with indexes, and it has a table 
showing the Systematic Arrangement of Families and Genera. It is 
well printed and is altogether an attractive volume.

serves as a foot-for the stand. The latter is fitted 
with rack and pinion only, whichis quite sufficient 
forthe low powers with which the entomologist is 
concerned. The usual stage is in this
