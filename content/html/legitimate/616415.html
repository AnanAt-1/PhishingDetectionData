<div ALIGN="CENTER">Early Settlements - Jackson Township</div>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A settlement made in Jackson Township and for many years known as the &quot;Haw Patch Settlement&quot; three
miles northeast of Edinburg, was one of the earliest made in the county. &nbsp;Many of the settlers of Jackson
became active in the public affairs of the county. &nbsp;One of the first to take up his residence in that section was Colonel Hiram Alldredge, who was appointed by the board of commissioners, at their first term in 1822, to the office of County Clerk. &nbsp;This office he filled most faithfully until his death which occurred early in the thirties. &nbsp;Other prominent early settlers were -<br>
<B>Judge Joseph Dawson<BR>
the Rev. James Clark<BR>
Moses Pruitt <BR>
Judge Joshua B. Lucas<BR>
Zechariah Collins <BR>
the Rev. Alfred Phelps<BR>
Ivory H. Leggett <BR>
Dr. Benjamin Sanders<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson Township forms the southwest corner of Shelby
County, and is bounded on the north by Hendricks Township, on the east by Washington Township, on the south by
Bartholomew County, and on the west by Johnson County.&nbsp; It would be difficult to find anywhere a finer body
of land. &nbsp;BigBlue River flows through the nortwestern part, Honey Creek is in the center, and Lewis Creek
and Flat Rock in the southeast corner. &nbsp;Two-thirds of the township, on the northeastern side, is beautifully
undulated and rolling land, of clay loam, very rich and productive.&nbsp; The Blue River Valley is level, and the
soil light and porous, but very superior.&nbsp; The farms are in splended order, and the whole township is dotted
over with beautiful residences. Those of <B>&nbsp;Snepp,&nbsp; Mutz,&nbsp; Hagaman,&nbsp; Eberland,&nbsp; Compton,&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutsiner,&nbsp;
Prewitt, &nbsp;Stine, &nbsp;Mahley</B> and many other deserve mention. It is an excellent grain-growing region,
and much cattle-raising is done. &nbsp;Near Mount Auburn is the extensive tile factory of <B>&nbsp;Mahley &amp;
Wertz</B>, and in the southwestern corner the large saw and planing mill of <B>Alexander Prewitt</B>.&nbsp; There
are no less than nine schools in the township, one of them, in the Snepp neighborhood, a graded school.&nbsp; The
churches are also well represented. &nbsp;In the northwest corner, in the Scott neighborhood, there is a Baptist
Church; in Mount Auburn, a Church of the Christian denomination; a Methodist Episcopal Church in the Ensley neighborhood,
in the southern part of the township, together with two large and influential Lutheran Churches; St. Paul's at
Mount Auburn, and St. George's in the Snepp neighborhood, under the pastoral care of an able and learned clergyman,
the Rev. <B>John H. Link. </B>&nbsp;There is also a Methodist Protestant Church at Jollity.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those who first settled here were<br>
<B>Col Hiram Aldridge<BR>
Judge Joseph Dawson<BR>
Rev James Clark<BR>
Moses Prewitt<BR>
Judge Joshua B. Lucas<BR>
Zechariah Collins<BR>
Rev. Alfred Phelps<BR>
Ivory H. Leggett<BR>
Dr. Benjamin Sanders<BR>
John Cutsinger<BR>
Jacob Wirtz<BR>
David and Jesse Scott<BR>
Abner Connor<BR>
John and George Warner</B>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first County Clerk, Col. <B>Hiram Aldridge</B>, was
from Jackson Townshp.&nbsp; He settled on the land now owned by Mr. <B>S. Cutsinger</B>, on the line between Johnson
and Shelby Counties. Shelby, having been first organized, and thought to be more desirable, he built a shanty upon
the Shelby side of his place to sleep in, thus became a candidate for the office of Clerk, and was elected. &nbsp;The
shanty stood for a long time between where the fine mansion house of Mr. Cutsinger now stands and the road. Col.
Aldridge was a faithful officer, an accomplished gentleman, and a man of unbounded popularity. &nbsp;The Hon.<B>
J.&nbsp;B. Lucas</B> and Judge <B>Joseph Dawson</B> were leading men. &nbsp;The late <B>&nbsp;Dr. Andrew J. Treon</B>&nbsp;
was a pioneer, a very successful physician, eccentric but talented, and left hosts of warm friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among
the prominent men of later times may be mentioned <B>Jacob Mutz</B>, who has been in the&nbsp;Legislature several
times; <B>William Patterson</B>, our present Representative; the late <B>William M.</B>&nbsp;<B>Phillips</B>, Treasurer,
1862-66; and &nbsp;<B>George W. Isley</B>, Auditor, 1875-79; <B>Samuel Cutsinger</B> and&nbsp;others. The people
of Jackson Township are generally from the State of Pennsylvania and Montgomery County, Ohio, and in point of intelligence,
morality and wealth, are second to none in this county.&nbsp; Mount Auburn is the only post office, and is a pleasantly situated village. ~ ~<BR>
