In biblical context, cities often represent centers of human civilization and culture. The "holy city" contrasts with earthly cities, symbolizing purity and divine order. This vision is given to John, the apostle, who is exiled on the island of Patmos. The concept of a holy city is rooted in the Old Testament, where Jerusalem is often depicted as the dwelling place of God (<a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>).<p><b>the new Jerusalem</b><br>The "new Jerusalem" represents the fulfillment of God's promises and the ultimate restoration of His people. It is not merely a physical city but a symbol of God's eternal kingdom. This new creation is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a>, which speaks of a new heaven and a new earth. The new Jerusalem is the culmination of God's redemptive plan, contrasting with the old Jerusalem, which was subject to sin and destruction.<p><b>coming down out of heaven from God</b><br>The descent of the new Jerusalem "out of heaven from God" emphasizes its divine origin and nature. Unlike earthly cities built by human hands, this city is a gift from God, signifying His initiative in salvation and restoration. This imagery echoes the vision of Jacob's ladder in <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, where heaven and earth are connected by divine action. It underscores the idea that the new creation is not achieved by human effort but by God's sovereign will.<p><b>prepared as a bride</b><br>The preparation "as a bride" highlights the city's beauty, purity, and readiness for a divine relationship. In biblical times, a bride's preparation was a significant cultural event, symbolizing purity and commitment. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to describe the relationship between God and His people, such as in <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a> and <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>. The city, like a bride, is made ready for a sacred union with God.<p><b>adorned for her husband</b><br>The adornment "for her husband" signifies the intimate and covenantal relationship between God and His people. In ancient Jewish culture, a bride adorned herself to meet her groom, symbolizing joy and anticipation. This phrase reflects the eschatological hope of the church as the bride of Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a>. The adornment represents the righteousness and glory bestowed upon the church by Christ, the bridegroom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who receives and records the vision of the new Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_city,_new_jerusalem.htm">The Holy City, New Jerusalem</a></b><br>Symbolizes the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people, representing the fulfillment of God's promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The origin from which the new Jerusalem descends, indicating its divine nature and purity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The source and preparer of the new Jerusalem, emphasizing His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His redemptive plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Represents the church, adorned and prepared for union with Christ, her husband.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_promise_of_a_new_beginning.htm">The Promise of a New Beginning</a></b><br><a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a> assures believers of a future where God will dwell with His people in a renewed creation.

Both images--the "city" and the "bride"--are familiar to the Bible student. The sacred city appears linked to God by a sacred bond. (Comp. <a href="/context/psalms/45-13.htm" title="The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of worked gold.">Psalm 45:13-14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm" title="I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4-5</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>.) The city-bride is now adorned for her Husband. We know what her ornaments are, now that He is about to present her to Himself a glorious Church: the meekness and gentleness of Christ, and her loving obedience to Him (<a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm" title="But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.">1Peter 3:4</a>), are her jewels. She is seen, not rising from earth or sea, like the foes of righteousness (<a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.">Revelation 13:11</a>), but coming down from heaven. The world will never evolve a golden age or ideal state. The new Jerusalem must descend from God. The true pattern, which alone will realise man's highest wishes, is the pattern in the mount of God (<a href="/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.">Acts 7:44</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem.</span> "John" must be omitted, according to all the best manuscripts. "The holy city" is the Church of God (see on Revelation 11:2), now glorified and prepared for perfect communion with her Redeemer (cf. the promise in <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, which is now fulfilled; cf. also <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10, 16</a>). Contrast this figure of the <span class="accented">holy city</span> with that of Babylon (see on Revelation 18.). <span class="cmt_word">Coming down from God out of heaven.</span> Connect "out of heaven" with "coming down." The same words occur in <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> (which see). <span class="cmt_word">Prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span> Here is the contrast to the "harlot" (see on Revelation 17:1). Though many of those forming the <span class="accented">bride</span> are rewarded according to their works (see <a href="/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13</a>), yet their own works are insufficient to fit them for their future life; they are <span class="accented">prepared</span> by God.
