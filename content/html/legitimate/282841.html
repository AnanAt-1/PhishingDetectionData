Came across <a href="http://www.escape.de/user/shusaku/euro96/issue3/roundgo.htm">this picture</a>
of a round Go board on the net.  For whatever reason, I became
inspired to write a Windows 95 program that would print out this round board across four
sheets of paper which can be taped together.<p>I have now made the board <a href="pdf/Roundgo.pdf">available in PDF</a>, so
it can be printed out on any computer (Mac/Windows/UNIX) using the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">free Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>.<p>
The Win95 C++ program that generated this image is available for 
<a href="download/GOCIRCLE.ZIP">download</a>,
and you may need.
 <a href="download/MFCDLLS.ZIP">two VC++ MFC DLL files.</a>  (But if I were you, I'd get the PDF version.)<P>
This is really a fun shape to play on.  Standard Go rules apply, and each point still has four liberties (even on the outside edges).

As of 5/12 the person who invented the round go board idea
e-mailed me.  It was Harald Schwarz (<a href = "mailto: schwarzh@cs.bonn.edu">
schwarzh@cs.bonn.edu</a>) who introduced this form of go during the
European Go Congress Summer 1996 at Abono Terme in Italy.
