Bugzero change management issue tracking system is a software application that allows 
an enterprise to record and follow the progress of every problem or issue that a user 
identifies until the problem is resolved. In Bugzero, an "issue" can be anything from a 
simple customer question or request to a detailed technical report of an error or a
problem. Internally or externally, intranet or internet, this software can be used by software 
developers and testers for bug tracking,
manufacturers for customer and sales tracking, and IT help desks and other service providers
for trouble ticketing (<a href="../helpdesk/index.html">ActiveLog</a>).
<p>
Bugzero provides a web-based enterprise-grade cost-effective scalable solution to increase team work efficiency.
It lets the user report an issue, track progression towards its resolution, 
and know who is responsible for resolving the issue. 
It is easy to use, yet still flexible and adaptive, and can be configured to accommodate
an organization's unique business process and workflow. It just works.
<p>

<font color="#0000cc" face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="-1">
We use Bugzero for all our development and production bugs, enhancements,
and documentation changes. We have 4 sites up and down the East Coast and all the sites utilize Bugzero.

<font color="red"><b>New:</b></font>
For our <a href="../en/solutions.html">SaaS hosting</a>,
we can now set up a staging instance just for you to test use the tool for a short period of time.
If you end up liking it, your data can be migrated to your final installation on our servers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bugzero can also be installed in a virtual host
environment that supports Java servlet/jsp and database access.

<font size="+1">Why Bugzero?</font>
</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>
Any serious software project team is going to need a real 
bug tracking database. The question is, among so many bug tracking programs you can buy
or even use for free, why choose Bugzero?
If the above feature list still hasn't convinced you, here is more:
<p>
<a href="bugzilla-gnats-bug-tracking.html" title="free bug tracking application">
Freeware open-source bug tracking tools</a> such as 
Bugzilla bug tracking system, GNATS problem report database,
or Debian defect tracking system usually takes a long time to set up,
are not easily customizable (even for simple things like add or remove a field), 
and are not fully supported.
Shareware defect tracking software does not cost much, but may not even have the basic
functions to be useful.
<a href="bug-tracking-pricing.html" title="defect tracking software pricing">
Expensive defect tracking systems</a>
may have a million poorly-written never used "features", but they certainly
do not worth the cost ($300-$600 per user license fee and high maintenance fee).
They are too complex, rarely configured properly, confusing, and cumbersome to be effectively used.
<p>
Bugzero speaks for itself. It is user-friendly and powerful. 
It has all the practical functions of a professional issue-tracking program,
yet offers an intuitive, simple, and
straight-forward user interface that requires no end user training at all (simplicity).
You are in full control of the tool.
Bugzero is also highly affordable,
minimizes your overall cost by utilizing your existing   
hardware and software systems and integrating with them
seamlessly (integration).

<p>
And most importantly, Bugzero comes with timely enterprise-level support. 
You can count on us for your specific needs and can expect a no-nonsense response
from us within minutes or hours at most.
Bugzero is free of known bugs; any bugs once found are fixed within days.

<p>
<img src="../img/quotation_left.gif" alt="">
<font color="#0000cc" face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="-1">
We've been using Bugzero for the past 3 years during many phases of development,
including user-acceptance and maintenance of websites and applications we create for our customers.
This amounts to over 40 different projects and tens of thousands of issues that have been tracked.

Data backup and recovery of Bugzero is simple.
You need backup the entire bugzero folder just once since it never changes after install.
All the data is stored in the database alone, and so you need back it up periodically.
In the case of a hardware or software crash, you just need restore either the bugzero folder
if the application server got crashed, or the database if the database server got crashed, or both
if they were installed on the same computer.

A good issue-tracking system is essentially a central repository for problem reports,
which may be software bugs, hardware defects, customer feedbacks, trouble tickets,
or any other collections of incidents and issues. 
The importance of such a system is its collaborative nature and 
its tracking and change-management capability. 
It is thus best to be used by a group of people in a geophysically distributed environment.

Bugzero is a near perfect environment for us, allowing us to handle customer 
email through a unified interface, assigning support requests to different people 
without "losing" any information about the customers' situation. 
The customer interface is just normal email-- no need for them to learn any web-based 
system-- and our interface is a slick and nicely customizable web interface.
Great program!
