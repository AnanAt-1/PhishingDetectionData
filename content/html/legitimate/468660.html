FOREWORD 




|HrS CHRONICLE had its inception in 1848, when the 
late Mr. John Keith Yerkes, of Fox Chase, Philadelphia, 
I conceived the idea of compiling a genealogy of the Yerkes 
I family of Pennsylvania. From that time until his death 
he gave many of his leisure hours to collecting family 
I records, which, after his death, passed into the possession 
of Judge Harman Yerkes, of Bucks County, who made material additions 
thereto. Early in 1903, Judge Yerkes placed the cc«nbined collections in the 
hands of the writer, who immediately entered upon the work of completing 
the family history, and bringing it into its present form. 

The reader of the Chronicle will find that the Yerkes family, as a 
whole, has been strongly attached to rural life. Dtuing the Eighteenth Century 
but two of the name abandoned the country for the city, and one of these 
eventually retired to his rural seat, and there passed his declining years. It 
is also worthy of note that the business activities of the family have been 
chiefly exerted in the line of agriculture, which has justly been placed at the 
head of the sciences, and which, as Washington wrote, " is the most health- 
ful, most useful, and most noble employment of man." For more than one 
hundred and twenty-five years, the men of the family, with few exceptions, 
engaged in farming, and each was the owner of the plantation he cultivated, 
which was usually one of large dimensions. 

The plantations of the early Yerkeses were located among the fertile 
hills of the Manor of Moreland and along that beautiful stream, the Penny- 
pack, and amidst these surroundings there was bred a race of sturdy yeo- 



FOREWORD 

men, who gave strength to the State and added substantially to its solid 
wealth. 

The Yerkes family, as the reader will discover, has been notedly a reli- 
gious one. The earlier generations were almost universally of the B^^st faith, 
whidi affiliation was clearly the outgrowth of the marriage of the emigrant 
ancestor, Anthony Yerkes, with the widow of the Reverend John Watts, 
Pastor of the Pennepdc Baptist Church, and of that of his son, Herman Yerkes, 
with a daughter of this esteemed divine. In the later generations, while this 
^th has predominated, the family has embraced within its folds many repre- 
sentatives in the leading bodies of the Christian Church.

CHRONICLE OF THE YERKES FAMILY 




I NTHONY YERKES', the founder of 
I the Yerkes family in Pennsylvania, came 
I to that Province about 1700, or possibly a 
1 few years prior to that date. The earliest 
I record of him in the Province is under 
I date of 1 1 September, 1702, on which day 
I he served as a juryman in a cause heard 
before the Court of Record at Germantown, Philadelphia. 
Is it likely that he would have been selected for this service 
had he not been a resident there for at least a few years? 

The place of nativity of Anthony Yerkes remains a 
matter of conjecture. It has been assumed by others that 
he was a German, but the writer has found no evidence to 
establish such assumption. It is possible, however, that he 
came to Pennsylvania from Germany, and was a resident of 
the latter country at the time of his emigration. But, where- 
soever the place of his birth, there are some items of circum- 
stantial evidence which tend to indicate that he was of Hol- 
land descent. This evidence is found in the facts that 
he became a member of the Low Dutch Reformed Church 
organized in 1710 in Whitemarsh Township, Philadel- 
phia (now Montgomery) County; that most of his fellow 



CHRONICLE OF THE 



church-members * were of Dutch birth or of Dutdi descent ; and that another 
of his surname^ undoubtedly a Hollander^ earlier emigrated to New York, and 
was a member of the Dutch Church in that city. 

Conjectural as may be the place of birth of Anthony Yerkes and the 
nationality of his immediate ancestors, the author is strongly of the opinion 
that the family is of Norman extraction, and that it acquired its surname from 
the town of Jurquez, in France, which town is mentioned in the Norman Rolls 
as early as a.d. 141 7. f 

The varying orthography of the name affords an interesting etymological 
study. In Pennsylvania the variations have been : Gerkes, Gerckes, Jerghes, 
Jerghjes, Yercas, Yerkhas,Yerkas, Yerkiss, Yerkus, and Yerkes. The Yerkeses 
themselves, however, have almost universally written it Yerkes, the variance 
from this form being chiefly in old records and doctunents written by others 
than the family. In New York the spelling has been : Jurcx, Jurckes, Jurck- 
sen, Jurckzen, Yerks, Yercks, and Yerkes, the latter being the form of spelling 
now in general use there. In Holland the name would appear to have been 
Yerscke, and the family there located in the province of Zealand, where it bore 
for arms Party per fess in chief gu. a fess w(wy org. in hose ermine. 

Upon coming to America, Anthony Yerkes settled at Germantown, the 
fair name of which place had no doubt come to his attention before he departed 
from his home in the old world to establish one in the new. On his arrival 
he probably found some old acquaintances, and possibly some kinsfolk. Among 
the early settlers of the town was one David Scherkes, the sheriff of the muni- 
cipality in 1692. It has been suggested that ** Scherkes'' was another of the 
variations in the spelling of the surname Yerkes, and that David Scherkes was 
a kinsman of Anthony. 

When Anthony Yerkes settled in Germantown, the inhabitants of that 
place were enjoying the privileges of a borough government, organized in 
1691, under the title and name of '^ the Bailiffe, Burgesses, and Commonalty 
of Germantown," by virtue of the charter granted in 1689 by William Penn. 
This charter gave the corporation large powers, but only those named in it, 
together with those who were from time to time admitted into membership 
by the General Court, were entitled to participate in the affairs of government. 
The first General Court held was presided over by the eminent Francis Daniel 
Pastorius, the first Bailiff, and at its early sittings the incorporators enacted 
numerous laws and ordinances for the regulation of the civil affairs of the 
corporation, among which was the following : 

" Each and every one who shall hereafter wish to buy or rent land in 

* Our Ancestors, i. 41.

YEI^KES FAMILY 



the township of Germantown, or settle within it, shall first procure from the 
General Court of his fellow-citizens the right or privilege of living there, and 
without such permission no one shall participate in our privil^es/' 

Anthony Yerkes was an applicant for such right and privileges, and his 
application met with favor at the hands of the court. In 1702 he was selected, 
as before mentioned, to serve as a juror in the Court of Record of the borough, 
and in January, 1702-03, he was chosen by the General Court one of die 
burgesses, in the place of one who was elected in the previous month but 
had been excused from serving. At the succeeding annual election, i Decem- 
ber, 1703, he was re-elected Burgess, and duly qualified for the office on the 
28th of the same month, as appears from the following abstract of the minutes 
of the General Court under that date : 

"Arents Klinker, Bailiff, Hans Heinrich Meels, Peter Schumaker, Jr., 
and Anthony Gerkes, three eldest burgesses, Simon Andrews recorder and 
William De Wees constable, were all attested to serve in their respective 
places." * 

The bailiffs and burgesses were the chief public functionaries of the 
municipality, and selections to fill these offices were made from among the 
leading men in the corporation. These officials acted as justices of the peace, 
and they constituted the Court of Record provided for in the charter, and their 
presence was necessary to compose a legal meeting of the General Court of the 
borough, in which various capacities Mr. Yerkes rendered service during the 
two terms in which he held a burgess-ship. 

Mr. Yerkes was a farmer, and engaged in this pursuit upon his settle- 
ment at Germantown. The acreage of the town was so limited that it pre- 
cluded extensive land-holdings by a single individual, and Mr. Yerkes, after 
carrying on farming there for a few years, concluded to extend his agri- 
cultural operations by establishing himself on a larger plantation than could 
be had in that place, and to this end he purchased, in 1709, a tract of three 
hundred acres in the Manor of Moreland, to which he removed with his family. 
As this is the earliest recorded purchase of real estate by the founder of the 
Yerkes family, it is believed that the deed of conveyance for the same cannot 
fail to be of interest to his descendants, so a copy of the same is here inserted : 



''To ALL Christiak fboflx to whom these Presents Shall G&gt;me greeting know ye 
that I John Holme of Dublin Township, G&gt;unty of Philadelphia and Province of Pennsyl- 
vania Yeoman for and in consideration of the Sum of Seventy five Pounds Current Silver 

* Klinker, the bailiff, is said to have come to Philadelphia with William Penn, and to have built 
the first two-story house in Germantown, Penn attending the "raising dinner.'' (Watson's Annals, 
U. so.) Schumaker and Meels, the associates of Yerkes in the burgess-ship, figured prominently in the 
early history of Germantown. The former, with Klinker, was appointed in 1701 on a committee to 
collect subscriptions for a school and arrange with a teacher.

The Manor of Moreland, in which the plantation above conveyed was 
located, has been the birthplace of numerous descendants of Anthony Ycrkes, 
and from the time he settled there, down to the present day, it has been the 
home of some of his progeny. The Manor was composed of a tract of ten 
thousand acres, and was created, m 1682, by a grant from William Penn to 
Dr. Nicholas More, who became the first president of the Free Society of 
Traders, the first speaker of the Provincial Assembly, and the first chief justice 
of the Province. The chief part of the Manor was in the county of Phila- 
delphia, but since the organization of Montgomery County it has formed 
Moreland Township in that county. In the early records it is variously de- 
scribed as the Manor of Moreland, Moreland Township, and Moreland, and 
when these names are given in this work they are to be taken as synonymous. 

Anthony Yerkes appears to have been so comfortable in his financial cir- 
cumstances that he was able to retire from active business a few years after he 
occupied his plantation in Moreland, and to hand over the plantation to his 
sons. He gave two htmdred acres of the same to his eldest son, Herman, 
and one hundred acres to his youngest son, Adolphus, and he subsequently 
executed deeds of conveyance for their respective portions. In a deed dated 
II June, 1719,* he is styled "of Dublin Township," to which point he is 
believed to have removed upon his retirement from business. His second 
wife's relatives, the Wattses, resided in the latter township, and the motive 
prompting his removal there may have been a desire to gratify her wish to 
be near her family. 

The date of Mr. Yerkes's death has not been ascertained. He was living 
20 August, 1723, when he executed a deed to his son Herman, but died prior

CHRONICLE OF THE 



to I Marchy 1744, when Herman made a deed for a portion of the land 
conveyed to him by his father, in which the father is mentioned as being 
deceased. He married twice. His first wife, Margaret, emigrated with him 
to Pennsylvania, and died before 17 November, 1705, on which day, as is 
learned from the Raster of Christ Church, Philadelphia, he married Sarah 
Watts, the widow of Reverend John Watts,* the eminent pastor of the Lower 

* Rbtkkbnd John Watts, the first husband of Sarah Eaton, and the father of Elisabeth Watts, 
wife of Herman Yerkes, the eldest son of Anthony Yerkes, was bom at Leeds, co. Kent, England, 3 
NoTember, i66x, and died in Lower Dublin Township, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, 97 August, 
1703. He was a son of Henry Watts by his wife Ellinor Duck, and grandson of Gregory and Margaret 
Watts, of Leeds. 

John Watts came to Pennsylrania about the year x686, and in the following jrear was baptised 
in the Baptist faith, and connected himself with the Lower Dublin Baptist Church,— popularly known 
as the Pennepek Baptist Church,— the first congregation of this denomination organized in Philadel- 
phia County. In x688 Mr. Watts entered the ministry, and two years later became the pastor of this 
church, and held such chaige until his death. 

The Pennepek Church was for many ]rears the centre of Baptist influence in the Middle Colonies, 
and it occupies an historic position as the oldest oiganization in Pennsylrania of the second largest 
Protestant denomination in America. Mr. Watts's labors were not confined to his own parish. He 
visited the scattered companies of Baptists in New Jersey, to preach and baptize, and he was for some 
years virtually the minister of the small congregation at Philadelphia which later became the First 
Baptist Churdi in that city. 

Morgan Edwards, in his noted "History of the Baptists," pronounced Bir. Watts a "sound 
divine." That he was a man of scholarly attainments is evidenced in his writings. He was the author 
of a Baptist Catechism, printed in 1700, one of the earliest publications in the Province. He also wrote 
a work entitled *' Davis Disabled," a reply to "Jesus the Crucified Man, the Eternal Son of God," 
written by William Davis. The main doctrine set forth in Davis's book was " that the divine nature 
and human were so blended in the person of Christ that he was not properly God nor properly man, 
but a compound of both." Davis had been a preacher among the Friends, but left this Society in the 
separation of 1690^ with George Keith, and was one of the forty-eight who signed the reasons and 
causes of such separation. In 1697 he embraced the princ^les of the Baptists and joined the Pennepek 
Church, where he began to inculcate the above-named doctrine with great assiduity. Mr. Watts and 
his congregation deemed such teaching heresy, and on 17 February, 1698, expelled Mr. Davis from 
their church. 

Mr. Watts was buried in the graveyard of his church, where his tombstone bears the following 
acrostical inscription, now almost undecipherable : 



" I nterred here I be, 

O that you could now see , 

H ow unto Jesus for to flee, 
N ot hi shi still to be. 

W aming in time pray take 
A nd peace by Jesus make. 
T hen at the last when you awake, 
^ S ure at his right hand jrou'll partake. 

Died

77, 17W." 

Mr. Watts married, 93 February, X687-S8, Sarah Eaton, bom in Wales, x April, X655 ; died in the 
Manor of Moreland, Pennsylvania, 97 June, 1793 ; daughter of John Eaton. 

A fuller sketch than is here given of Mr. Watts, as well as an account of some of his descendants, 

will be found in the author's work, " Memorials of the Reading, Howell, Yerkes, Watts, Latham, and

SECOND GENERATION 




2. HERMAN YERKES* (Antliony') was bom ctrca 
1689. He emigrated to Pennsylvania with his parents, and 
no doubt resided with them, at Germantown, until 1709, when 
his father purchased a plantation of three hundred acres in 
the Manor of Moreland, to which estate tlie family doubtless 
removed about that time. Subsequently — probably at the 
time of the marriage of Herman Yerkes — the father set apart 
to his son two hundred acres of the above named plantation, 
and formally conveyed to him such portion by deed dated 
20 August, 1723.* 

Herman Yerkes was a farmer and miller, and he con- 
ducted his business affairs with such energy, prudence, and 
success, that he came to possess considerable wealth, in the 
accumulation of which he was materially assisted by the 
strong hands of his eight sturdy sons. He added largely 
to his landed estate, acquiring in all about eight hundred 
acres of the best farm land in the Manor of Moreland. In 
1744 he formed a co-partnership with Walter Moore in the 
milling business, and, as partners, they built a water grist- 
mill on the bank of the Pennypack Creek, upon a portion of 
* Pblltulelphia Deeds, H, viil. 4ij-4i7- 



CHRONICXE OF THE 



the plantation of Mr. Yerkes, who set apart nineteen acres of the same for 
milling purposes. Mr. Yerkes devised his interest in the mill property to his 
four youngest sons, — Silas, Stephen, Elias, and Titus, — and the three last 
named released their interests to their brother Silas, who, 4 July, 1757, con- 
veyed all of his rights to Walter Moore, the former partner of his father. At 
a later period this property was acquired by one Shelmire, and was long known 
as " Shehnire's Mills.'' 

Mr. Yerkes died on his plantation in Mordand, between 2 May, 1750, the 
date of his will, and 4 March, the following year, the time it was proved 
at Philadelphia. The following is a copy of the principal provisions of 
the will: 

" In the name of God ambn, the Second Day of May One Thousand Seven hundred

3. ADOLPHUS YERKES* (Anthony^) is supposed to have emigrated 
to America with his parents. The earliest record of his presence in Pennsyl- 
vania is under date of 10 Jtme, 17199 when he joined his father in conveying 
to John Simcock one htmdred acres of land, with the buildings thereon, located 
in the Manor of Moreland, being a portion of the plantation of three hundred 
acres which the father had bought from John Holme, 5 November, 1709, and 
which one hundred acres the father had previously given, but not conveyed, to 
the son. The consideration money expressed in the deed is £137 6s. 8rf., and 
the son is styled therein as " of Moreland, yeoman." ^ At that date he was 
doubtless residing on the estate so sold. 

The day following such conveyance Adolphus Yerkes purchased from 
Simcock all his right, title, and interest of, in, and to the share which he, 
Simcock held in the stock of the Society of Free Traders, together with the 
rights to liberty lands and city lots in Philadelphia, which attached to the 
ownership of the stock, paying therefor the sum of £100. § A few days later 
Adolphus Yerkes assigned imto his brother, Herman Yerkes, three fourth 
parts of the estate so acquired from Simcock. ||

But little further is known of AdoI[dius Yerices. He had a wife, Ann, 
and three children.* Ann Yerkes was a Baptist, and received a letter of dis- 
mission from the Pennepdc Baptist Church, in 1724, to j&lt;»n the Mtmtgomery 
Baptist Church, and in 1727 recdved a similar letter from the latter to the 
former church, from which it would appear that about this time the iamily 
removed to the locality of the Pennepek Church in Lower Dublin Township, 
Philadelphia County. Both Mr. and Mrs. Yerkes were living 5 October, 1744, 
on which day they renounced their right to administer upon the estate of 
their deceased son, Anthony, but whether or not they were in Pennsylvania at 
that time is not known. There is a tradititm in the family that one of the 
sons of Anthony Yerkes, the emigrant, removed to Virginia, but no record 
has been discovered to support such tradition.

THIRD GENERATION 




4. ANTHONY YERKES" (Herman', Anthony&gt;), 
the eldest son of Herman Yerkes by his wife Elizabeth 
Watts, was born in the Manor of Moreland, Montgomery 
(formerly Philadelphia) County, Pennsylvania, 28 November, 
1712, and died there, g March, 1791. He was a farmer, and 
resided in said Manor, on a tract of land which he purchased 
from his father. This tract contained one hundred acres, and 

I lay on the east side of the road leading from Philadelphia 
to Southampton, Bucks County, and near the "old mill." 
He also owned a tract of over eighty acres, which he pur- 

I chased from his brother, Elias Yerkes, and which was located 
1 the west side of this road, opposite the first-named tract 
He was a member of the Southampton Baptist Church, Bucks 
County, and in 1772 was one of the committee for the build- 
ing of a new meeting-house. The Pennsylvania Gazette of 
2 July, 1767, contains the following: 

"FIVE POUNDS REWARD. 

*' Stolen, last night, out of the Pasture of the Subscriber, living in 

I the Manor of Moreland, Philadelphia County, a black Horse, about 15 

hands high, well set, a Star in his forehead, a thick curly mane, hangins

3 Gears, Paces, Trots, and Gallops. Whoever takes up said Horse, and

Reward, and for the Horse only Three pounds, with reasonable charges paid by 

"Anthony Ybuos. 
" N.B.— The Horse is about eight years old." 

No record of the marriage of Anthony Yerkes has been found. The 
Christian name of his wife was Jane, and she died 12 May, 1783, in the 
seventy-third year of her age. The names of their children, as given below, 
are from his will,'*' dated 22 February, 1790; proved 26 April, the following 
year.

5. JOHN YERKES* (Herman*, Anthony^), second son of Herman 
Yerkes by his wife Elizabeth Watts, was bom in the Manor of Moreland, 
Montgomery (formerly Philadelphia) County, Pennsylvania, 21 February, 
1 714, and died there in 1790. He was a farmer, and probably resided through- 
out his life in said Manor, where he owned a plantation of ninety-five acres, 
upon which he and his wife Alice executed a mortgage to Joseph Spangen- 
burg, 2 Sq&gt;tember, 17474 It is, however, possible that he may have resided 
for a few years upon a plantation of two hundred acres in Plymouth Township, 
same cotmty, which he purchased on 24 May, i873,§ one htmdred and thirty- 
seven and one-half acres of which he sold to his brother, Herman Yerkes, 
18 May, 1747, the latter paying therefor £297.

of 1750, or in January, 1750-51, as on the 30th of that month letters of admin- 
istration on his estate were granted at Philadelphia unto his widow, Sarah 
Hufty, " during the minority of the minor children," her brother, Anthony 
Yerkes, being one of the sureties on the bond filed. She was living 30 April, 

* Edmond McVaugh (sometimes spelled McVeaugh or McVeagh), came to Pennsylvania In 
1682, in the employ of Captain Thomas Holme, the first Surveyor-General of that Province, and a mem- 
ber of the Provincial Council. McVaugh settled in Lower Dublin Township, Philadelphia County, 
where, in 1702, he possessed three hundred and one acres of land. On 19 October of that year he 
appeared before the Commissioners of Property,* and requested a re-survey of his land made up of three 
tracts adjoining each other. One tract consisted of two hundred and fifty acres, purchased of Peter 
Baynton, and two tracts contained together one hundred and one acres, purchased from Silas Crispin, 
aon-in-law of Captain Holme ; all of which lands were within the large tract in Lower Dublin Township, 
which Captain Holme purchased from William Penn, and through the centre of which Holme laid out 
a road called Susquehanna Road.t 

Edmond McVaugh died in 1739, his will being proved 3 November of that year. He is known 
to have had sons Edmond, Jeremiah, and John, and daughter Sarah, wife of Walter Moore, and, as 
his son Edmond is not named in his will, it is possible that he had other children than those named 
therein. He married Alice Dickinson, who came to Pennsylvania in 1683, with the family of James Har- 
rison. The latter was appointed Chief Justice of Pennsylvania in 1685, but declined the office. Mrs. 
McVaugh was living 29 March, 1737, when she joined her husband in a deed.} Among the descend- 
ants of Edmond McVaugh was Colonel Benjamin McVeaugh, who commanded a battalion of the 
Philadelphia County militia in the Revolution. 

t In compiling the " Memorials of the Readhig, Howell, Yerkes, Watts, Latham, and Elkins 
Families" (Philadelphia, 1898), I supposed that Sarah Yerkes above was the one of that name who 
married, 6 March, 1747, Daniel Evans, as sUted in that work (page 199). Later information shows 
that I was then in error.

son of Herman Yerkes by his wife Elizabeth Watts, was bom in the Manor 
of Moreland, Montgomery (formerly Philadelphia) County, Pennsylvania, 
28 November, 1718; died there, in September, 1793. He was a farmer, and 
resided on a farm given to him by his father, in Moreland, on the Pennypack 
Creek, above the mills of his brother Silas. On 22 July, 1747, he mortgaged * 
his land, consisting of eighty-four acres, to Joseph Spangenburg. His wife 
Mary joined him in this mortgage; also in a mortgage f of the same land, 
given to George Sharswood, of Philadelphia, 16 April, 1765, to secure the 
pajrment of £200; and in a deed,:]: dated 11 February, 1755, by which he con- 
veyed certain lands to his brother, Stephen Yerkes. The date of his marriage 
or the maiden name of his wife is not certainly known, although it is probable 
that the name was Walton, as Nathaniel Walton, of Moreland, in his will, 
dated 6 February, 1777, names " my sister Mary Yerkes." § Mr. Yerkes no 
doubt survived his wife, as she is not named in his will.|| This instrument, 
dated 2 December, 1791, proved i October, 1793, describes him as '' of the 
Manor of Moreland,'' and names son Joshua, son Josiah, daughter Rebecca 
Wood, granddaughter Sarah Boore, daughter Margary, daughter Mary, and 
son Nathaniel, the latter being named as executor, and the devisee of his 
plantation, which at that time consisted of one hundred acres.

&amp; HARMAN YERKES* (Herman*, Anthony^), fourth son and fifth 
child of Herman Yerkes by his wife Elizabeth Watts, was bom in the Manor 
of Mordand, Montgomery (formerly Philadelphia) County, Pennsylvania, 
18 January, 1720; died there, 29 November, 1804. He began his business 
career as a farmer and miller. From 1752 until 1755, he engaged in mercan- 
tile pursuits at Plymouth, but returned to farming the latter year, and con- 
tinued therein until 1788. He was a large land-owner. His first real estate 
purchase was made when he was but twenty-six years old, and consisted of 
a tract of one htmdred and thirty-seven acres, located in Plymouth Township, 
Montgomery County, which he bought, 18 May, 1747, from his brother John, 
paying him therefore two hundred and ninety-seven potmds. It is believed 
that he removed to the land so purchased at about the time he acquired the 
sam^ and that he continued there until about 1762, when he is supposed to 
have become a resident of Warminster, Bucks County, where, in 1765, he was 
an overseer of the poor, and where, in 1772, he purchased a plantation of one 
hundred and eighty-one acres from Joseph Noble. This tract was situated on 
the Street Road at what is now Johnsville Station on the Northeast Pennsyl- 
vania Railroad, and on this tract Harman Yerkes established the first home- 
stead of the Yerkeses in Bucks Cotmty, and there some of his descendants 
have ever since resided. He returned to the Manor of Moreland in 1788, 
which continued to be his place of residence the remainder of his life. 

Mr. Yerkes was an active supporter of the War of Independence, and in 
1775 he and his son Edward, who was but eighteen years of age, enrolled 
themselves in the Warminster Company of Associators. On 31 July, 1777, 
he was recommended to the Executive Council by Judge Henry W)mkoop to 
look after billeting the poor. It is probable that his military service was with 
the militia only. On more than one occasion the British troopers from Phila- 
delphia were his unwelcome visitors, and his family was subjected to the 
actual terrors and trials of grim war. In this connection Judge Harman 
Yerkes, of Bucks County, has contributed the following item : 

"His wife, Mary Clayton, proved herself worthy of the duty of taking charge of a 
young family in such times, as is shown by the following incident, which the writer heard 
related from the lips of one (Stephen Beans, then a small boy) who was present 

"The house then occupied by the family stood where the smaller end of the present 
homestead now stands. It contained a sitting-room and kitchen on the first floor, with an 
3 17 



CHRONICLE OF THE 



out attachment used as quarters for the slaves. The second floor was divided into convenient 
rooms by plain board partitions. 

" The battle of ' Crooked Billet,' fought in 177S, began less than two miles away, and 
the retreat, or rather rout, of the Americans drifted directly over the adjacent lands. 
Some of the most harrowing scenes of that dreadful butchery occurred within sight of the 
Yerkes homestead. 

"The narrator of the story lived at the next place north, on the Street Road, and, 
the men of the neighborhood being away at the scene of strife, or in concealing the horses 
and cattle, he [Beans] accompanied his mother to the Yerkes place at the first alarm. 
While the two women and children were in the sitting room, an American soldier hastily 
ran into the houses coming from the south side, and took refuge under a bed which stood 
in the northeast comer of the room. He stated that he was being pursued by the enemy, 
and in much alarm asked that his place of hiding be concealed. Mrs. Yerkes told him he 
would not be safe there, but that by going out of the back door he could put the house 
between him and his pursuers, and might reach the next place, where there was a large pile 
of buckwheat straw, in which he could hide himself. He obeyed her directions, and in a 
very short time four British soldiers came in the opposite door and inquired for him. The 
ladies protested that he was not there. The soldiers then looked under the bed, searched the 
ttp-stairs rooms, and, after maliciously sticking their bayonets through the bed-clothing, 
continued the pursuit 

"The American afterwards returned and thanked the ladies for his deliverance, and 
stilted that the British had trampled over the straw and thrust their bayonets far into it, but 
fortunately without touching him. They spoke of setting fire to it, but owing to some alarm, 
abandoned the idea and departed.'' 

The religious affiliations of Harman Yerkes are matters of some interest 
to his descendants. His earliest church connection was, probably, either with 
the Low Dutch Church, in which faith his father was no doubt bom, or with 
the Baptists, the faith of his mother, but on the eve of his first marriage he 
identified himself with the Society of Friends, his first wife being of that per- 
suasion. After this, his speech and manners are said to have conformed to the 
custom of the Friends; nevertheless, his second and third marriages were 
performed by Baptist clergymen, and he seems to have become a member 
of the Southampton Baptist Church, Bucks County, as he was one of the com- 
mittee of that church, in 1772, for the building of a new meeting-house, and 
was buried in the graveyard of the same. These latter facts suggest the strong 
probability that shortiy before his second marriage he attached himself to the 
faith of his mother, and of his distingtiished grandfather, the Reverend John 
Watts. 

His death is thus recorded in the American Daily Advertiser, under date 
of 7 December, 1804: 

"Dud^ in Moreland Township, Montgomery County, on the 29th of November, Mr. 
Haiman Yerkes, in the 85th year of his age, and on the 2d inst his remains were interred 
in the Baptist burial-ground, at Southampton, followed by a numerous train of relatives 
and friends. In him was united the tender husband, the affectionate father, and the steady

" Yes, he must die 1 the nearest friend most part ; 
The Victor Death, excepts not of a claim ; 
And though the stroke may crush a kindred heart 
He heeds it not, — to supplicate is vain ! 

"He has gone, his spirit has flown to regions of everlasting bliss; but long will he 
exist in the hearts of those whom he hath left behind, — ^yea, until time with them shall be 
no longer, until they like him shall be no more." 

He married (i), at Plymouth Mecting-Housc, 22 March, 1750-51, Mary, 
daughter of Edward Stroud, of Whitemarsh. She died circa 1771, and he 
married (2), 30 September, 1773, Mrs. Mary (Houghton) Clayton, widow 
of Richard Qayton. She died in 1785, and bequeathed a sum of money to 
the Southampton Baptist Church for building a wall around its graveyard, 
with which church she was actively identified, and by whose pastor. Reverend 
Jonathan Blackwood, she was married to Mr. Yerkes. He married (3), 
28 March, 1788, Mrs. Elizabeth (Ball) Tompkins, widow of John Tompkins. 
She died in 1819. After this marriage Mr. Yerkes removed to his wife's 
home, on the Old York Road, in Moreland, where the " widow" Tompkins 
kept an inn and store, the management of which now fell to Mr. Yerkes.

9. SILAS YERKES* (Herman*, Anthony^), sixth child and fifth son 
of Herman Yerkes by his wife Elizabeth Watts, was bom in the Manor of 
Moreland, Montgomery (formerly Philadelphia) County, 15 February, 1723; 
died there, 25 September, 1795, and was buried in the graveyard of the 
Southampton Baptist Church. He was a large land-owner and a prosperous 
miller and farmer. Under the will of his father, Silas Yerkes became entitled 
to a one-fourth interest in the property in Moreland that had been the home- 
stead of the father and grandfather, and by deed of 10 February, 1755, the 
remaining interests in the property, which consisted of two hundred acres, 
were conveyed to him by his mother and his brothers Stephen, Elias, and Titus. 
At this time Silas Yerkes was residing in Warwick Township, Bucks Cotmty,

where he would seem to have been engaged in the milling business, as he is 
described as " miller" in the conveyance here mentioned, and he continued to 
reside there until after the birth of his daughter Elizabeth, when he removed 
to the homestead estate in Moreland, and there continued the milling business, 
as well as carried on farming. The mill property later came into possession 
of the Shelmire family, and was long known as ** Shelmire's Mills." The mills 
were destroyed by fire some years ago. The spot where they stood is one of 
the most picturesque localities in Montgomery County. In 1780 the tax list 
of Mordand contained over four hundred names, the third highest assessment 
being that of Silas Yerkes. 

Mr. Yerkes was a man of much intelligence and a devout Christian. In 
1755 he united with others in founding the Union Library Company of 
Hatboro, one of the earliest library organizations in Pennsylvania, and he was 
an active member of the Baptist Church, the principles and doctrines of which 
he imbibed from his mother and inherited from his grandfather, the Reverend 
John Watts. A formal profession of religious faith was, however, not made 
until I June, 1742, when he was baptized in the Pennypack Creek, and became 
a member of the Southampton Baptist Church, Bucks County, retaining mem- 
bership until his death. Mr. Yerkes no doubt received his Christian name 
in honor of his tmcle, Silas Watts. 

Silas Yerkes was married by the Reverend Joshua Potts, pastor of the 
Southampton Baptist Church, 14 June, 1750, to Hannah Dungan; bom in 
Bucks County, 24 September, 1725; died at the seat of her husband, 22 
August, 1792 ; daughter of Thomas and Esther Dungan, and granddaughter of 
the Reverend Thomas Dungan * by his wife Elizabeth Weaver. Silas Yerkes's 
will,t dated 21 March, 1795, was proved 22 October, same year, and names the 

* Rkvbrbnd Thomas Dungan was a son of William Dungan, a merchant of London, England, 
by his wife Prances Latham, and was bom in that dty about 1^2. His mother was a daughter of 
Lewis Latham, Sergeant-Falconer to Charles I. Upon the death of William Dungan, his widow mar- 
ried Captain Jeremiah Clarke, with whom, accompanied by her children, she emigrated to New Eng- 
land, and settled at Newport, Rhode Island, where Captain Clarke rose to prominence. Captain 
Clarke dying, his widow married, for third husband. Reverend William Vaughan, a Baptist detgy- 
man, of Newport. Thomas Dungan imbibed the Baptist faith, and became a Baptist dergsrman, 
having received his instruction in theology, it is thought, from his step-father. Reverend William 
Vaughan. He was one of the patentees of East Greenwich, Rhode Island ; was a representative of 
that town in the Assembly of that Colony in 1678 and 1681, and served as sergeant in the Newport 
militia. In 1682 he sold his estates at East Greenwich and Newport, and shortly afterwards removed 
to Pennsylvania, settling at Cold Spring, Bucks County, where he founded a Baptist Church, the first 
in that Province, and the first ^iglish congregation there outside of the Friends. Mr. Dungan 
became the pastor of the church, and continued his ministrations as such until his death in 1688. He 
married, at Newport, Elisabeth, daughter of Sergeant Qement Weaver by his wife Mary Freeborn. 
Seigeant Weaver was a member of the Rhode Island Assembly in 1678, and William Freeborn, his 
wife's father, was a member in 1657. (See " Memorials of the Reading, Howell, Yerkes, Watts, Latham, 
and Elkins Families" for fuller mention of Reverend Thomas Dungan, and some account of his family 
connections.)

married, 23 December, 1783, Rachel Shaw. He removed with his family to 
Ovid, New York, after 22 September, 1800, on which day he conveyed land in 
Moreland, which his father had conveyed to him 6 May, 1797, and the son is 
described in the former conveyance as " of Moreland." He is said to have had 
ten children, "all of whom died young." His will,* dated Ovid, ix June, 
1804, proved 28th of same month, names wife Rachel, and mentions "sons" 
and "daughters," but only one child by name, — Stephen. He directs that his 
estate should be sold, debts paid, and that his family should remove to Penn- 
sylvania, "among my relations, and there remain until my youngest child be 
twenty-one years of age." As none of the family are mentioned in his father's 
will, it is believed that all had died before the date thereof.

since known as the " Factory Farm," located in what is now Terwood, in 
Moreland Township. Two streams met upon the farm, the united water- 
power of which was utilized by Titus Yerkes to turn his saw-mill. He 
married, about 1757, Margaret Paul, who was no doubt a descendant of 
Joseph Paul, the founder of the well-known Paul family of Philadelphia. 
After the death of Mr. Yerkes she married, as second husband (license issued 
4 January, 1764), John Nesmith, a miller of Moreland, and she died 16. 
January, 1823, in the ei^ty-eighth year of her age. On 17 September, 1764, 
a few months after her second marriage, as the administratrix of Mr. Yerkes's

YERKES FAMILY 



" Philadelphia, September 22, 1768. 
" On Monday, the Third October, the Subscribers propose to open Evening Schools at 
their respective School Houses in this City, where will be taught, Writing, Arithmetic, Book- 
Keeping, &amp;c. Likewise the most useful Branches of the Mathematics, at the usual Prices, 
by David Ellison, William Oliphant, Todd and Dickinson, Moles Patterson, John Willson, 
James Cannon, Alexander Power, Andrew Porter, Patrick Lanagan, and Joseph Yerkcs." 

Those named were no doubt the chief school-masters in Philadelphia of 
that day, and it is an item of some interest to know that Joseph Yerkes is the 
only one who was of Dutch or German descent, and that most of the others 
were either of Scotch-Irish birth or lineage. William Oliphant and Alexander 
Power were tutors at the College of Philadelphia, now the University of 
Pennsylvania. James Cannon was Professor of Mathematics at the same 
institution, and Andrew Porter became a distinguished officer in the Revolu- 
tion, and was the ancestor of many noted Pennsylvanians.* 

When Samuel Hazzard came to write his " Annals of Philadelphia and 
Pennsylvania in the Olden Time," he recalled a few of the old school-teachers 
of Philadelphia, among them Joseph Yerkes. In his article on " Education," 
Hazzard writes : 



a 



Common education, to become general, should be low in price, and the places be 
occupied by patient, unambitious men, of peculiar minds — such as most like retirement and 
freedom from business excitements, and who, for that cause, are well satisfied to content 
themselves with small things. There are such men — ^and there were such men. The good 
Anthony Benezet taught his scholars at ten shillings a quarter; and we can remember the 
long and quiet lives of such school-masters as Lyttle, Todd, Trip, Clark, Rankin, Yerkes, 
Gartly, and others, at the same terms. They acquired a little home in a long life, were 
quite content, and only aimed at most to qualify their children for more aspiring situations. 
They never thought of vacations and indulgences, wherein the pupils lost half as much by 
absence as they had acquired. They conceived, and conceived truly, that their business was 
to make their scholars good writers, good arithmeticians, good readers, and intelligent gram- 
marians; and then they justly inferred that they were qualified, by their own separate exer- 
tions, to improve themselves at home, if they would, in all manner of intellectual attainments, 
such as history, philosophy, belles-lettres, etc." 



* Andrew Porter was appointed by Congress, 19 June, 1776, captain in the marine service, 
and was afterwards transferred to Lamb's Artillery, Continental Line. On 19 April, 1781, he was 
promoted major in the Pennsylvania Artillery Regiment, Continental Line, and on 34 December, 1782, 
lieutenant-colonel, to rank as such from i January, 1782, and he commanded that regiment from 
October, 1781, until the close of the war. Immediately after the war he was tendered the chair ol 
Mathematics in the University of Pennsylvania, but declined the same, saying that " as long as he had 
commanded men he would not return to flogging bosrs." He subsequently became a major-general in 
the Pennsylvania militia, and at his death was Surveyor-General of the State. He was the father of 
David Rittenhouse Porter, governor of Pennsylvania, 1832-1845 ; George Bryan Porter, governor of 
Michigan, 1832-1834 ; and of James Madison Porter, a distinguished jurist ; the grandfather of Hon- 
orable William A. Porter, a judge of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and of General Horace 
Porter, the present Ambassador of the United States to France ; and the great-grandfather of Colonel 
John Biddle Porter, U.S.A., Colonel William Brooke Rawle, and other prominent Philadelphiana.

Mr. Yerices was a member of the Society of Friends. At the time of his 
removal from Philadelphia he resided and had his school at the northwest 
comer of Third and Branch Streets, which property he owned. From his 
will,* dated 22 ii mo. (November), 1807, proved 21 January, 1808, we learn 
that he owned several tracts of land in Moreland. Two of these he purchased 
from his brother Jacob, two from his brother Anthony, and one from his 
uncle Silas. 

He married Hannah Ashton. She did not stu^ive her husband.

died at Baltimore, Maryland, 24 January, 1818. He was an officer in the 
Revolutionary army, serving as first lieutenant of Captain Josiah Hart's com- 
pany,! in the Fourth Battalion of Philadelphia County militia. He held 
positions of public trust in Baltimore, and was a member of the Ancient and 
Honorable Mechanical G)mpany of Baltimore, the oldest organization in that 
city. He married,:): i November, 1787, Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, nie Wilmer- 
ton, bom 15 March, 1750; died at Baltimore, 22 September, 1828; daughter 
of John and Mary Wilmerton; and at about the time of his marriage he 
removed to Baltimore, where he remained until his death. The following 
obituary appears in the American Daily Advertiser, of Philadelphia, under date 
of 31 January, 1818: 

" Dud— at Baltimore, on Saturday evening last, of an apoplectic fit, Mr. David Ybkkiss, 
in the 65th jrear of his age, for many years a respectable inhabitant of that City. Mr. Yerkiss 
was a native of Pennsylvania, and was bred in the Gilvinistic faith, but was among the first 
in this City to receive the heavenly doctrines of the New Jerusalem, promulgated in the 
theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, and has through life verified his faith by a 
deportment the most amiable and inoffensive. If to die without leaving a solitary enemy 
behind be evidence of worth, such may literally and truly, we believe, be said of Mr. Yerkiss, 
and his friends were as numerous as his acquaintances. He left an amiable wife and party 
to bemoan his loss and bathe with tears of anguish the fondly cherished memory of an 
affectionate husband, and indulgent parent"

Manor of Moreland, Montgomery (formerly Philadelphia) County, Pennsyl- 
vania, 6 October, 1743; died in Whitemarsh Township, same county, in 1803 
or 1806. The date marked on the inventory filed in his estate is 4 February, 
1803, and the administration bond is dated 4 February, 1806. One of these 
is no doubt an error. He was a farmer, and resided in Whitemarsh Town- 
ship. He married (license dated 20 August, 1769) Ann Coffing, daughter of 
Abraham and Margaret Coffing.* She was a member of Abington Meeting at 
the time of her marriage, but married " out of meeting," — ^that is, not accord- 
ing to the custom of the Society of Friends, — and in consequence of such 
" out going" she was deprived of her membership in that society.f

He was a member of Abington Meeting of Friends, from the records of which society it appeara that 
his daughtera Ann, Grace, and Martha married into the Yerkes family. Ann's marriage is given in 
the text. The Meeting records, under date of 19 September, 1769, note that " Grace Yerkes, late 
Coffin, is gone out in her marriage and don't incline to make satisfaction," and under date of 30 
November, 1773, the same fact is noted as to *' Martha Yerkes, late Coffin." ** Going out" in marriage 
was manying " out of Meeting," but while the fact of the marriages of Grace and Martha Coffing is not 
in doubt, the Christian names of their Yerkes husbands are unknown. Abraham Coffing was a son of 
Jacob Coffing, Sen', who was in Pennsylvania as early as 1690, and died in Northampton Township, 
Bucks County, in 1739. The will of the latter, dated 96 August, and proved 9 October, 173a, names 
sons Jacob, William, and Abraham. In some records the name is spelled Coffin.

Revolutionary soldier, and he married, 23 December, 1783, Mrs. Rachel 
Edwards, whose maiden name was Brooks. Of this marriage only one child 
is known, and the fact that he had such child is obtained from ** The Hogeland 
Family in America," page 226, where it is noted that " Elizabeth Yerkes, 
daughter of Josiah and Rachel (Brooks) Yerkes," married Jeshua Hogeland. 
Mr. Yerkes is said to have died when the daughter Elizabeth was '* only a few

at her home.

He was a son of Peter Saurman, who emigrated from Germany with his 
family, circa 1743. Dr. Joseph C. Martindale, in his " History of Byberry 
and Moreland," pages 326-328, gives the following account of Peter Saurman, 
the son: 

" Peier Saurman was born in Germany, and at the time of immigration to America 
was about three years old. He learned the trade of shoemaking from his father, but, having 
a taste for military life, he entered the British army during the latter part of the French

and Indian War, and served therein about one year. He then returned to Philaddphia, 
where he followed hid occupation ontil the Revolutionary War, when he entered the amqr 
under Washington. He remained with it until it was dist&gt;anded in 1783, and although he 
was in all the battles fought by it, yet he was never wounded or taken prisoner, and never 
sick during the whole time. On the evening preceding the battle of the Billet he obtained 
leave of absence to visit the young lady afterwards his wife, who was then residing at 
Thomas Wood's house, near Hatboro. He remained here all night, and early the following 
morning he saw an English soldier, armed with a musket, coming up the lane. He immedi- 
ately secreted himself behind a large cherry-tree, and waited until the soldier walked pasl^ 
when he stepped out and ordered him to surrender, at the same time presenting a pistoL 
The summons was obeyed, and the English soldier became a prisoner. Upon examining the 
captive's gun, it was found to be filled with mud and water. Upon the principle that ' to the 
victors belong the spoils,' Peter cleaned the gun and loaded it with three buckshot and a 
bullet, after which he started towards Hart's (William Hallowell's) Mill, where he saw ^:ft 
English soldiers along the roadside dividing their booty. He attempted to shoot them» hot 
the gun missed fire, and he was forced to run for his life. As he leaped over a fence the 
British fired at him, one ball passing through his coat pocket and two others striking the 
fence near him, but he escaped unhurt. After serving his country faithfully during the war, 
he returned to his trade, and located on the Pennypack, near what is now John Shdmire^a 
Mill, in Moreland, Montgomery County. In 1788 he moved to Hatboro, and in 1795 to Bndcs 
County, where he commenced farming. In 1804 he purchased a farm of ninety-four ac3^

tract, then described as consisting of one hundred and five acres. Mr. Yerkes 
is styled in this conveyance as '' of Mpreland," and it is believed that at about 
the time of the conveyance he removed with his family to Seneca County, 
New York, and settled there, in the town of Romulus. He married, in Penn- 
sylvania, Sarah Johnson, bom 20 September, 1765; died at Romulus, New

his son Josiah. One of the latter's descendants writes that other members of the 
family " removed West."

daughter and second child of Harman Yerkes by his wife Mary Stroud, was 
bom (probably in the Manor of Moreland) s'September, 1753; married, 14 
April, 1770, John Hufty, who is thought to have been her cousin, and son of 
Jacob Hufty by his wife Sarah Yerkes. (See No. 35.) The marriage is 
recorded on the books of the First Baptist Church, Philadelphia, and on the 
printed list of marriages of that church the name is erroneously given as 
" Huffdale." John Hufty lived upon lands of his wife's father, and afterwards 
occupied and farmed the plantation of her brother-in-law. Major Reading 
Howell, on the Street Road in Warminster Township, Bucks County, later 
removing with his family to Greene County, Pennsylvania, where he is said

YERKES FAMILY 



Children of John and Elizabeth* (Yerkes) Hufty: 

157. Phebe Hufty*, married Daniel Dance, and had issue. The family are said to hare 

removed to the West. Their son, Jacob Dance', married Harriet Love, and 
had daughter, Ann^, who married Rezin Beall Johnson, and had son, Hubert 
Rex Johnson", who was of Narberth, Pennsylvania, in 1898. 

158. Hufty*, married Webster. 

46. CATHARINE YERKES* (Harman», Herman^, Anthony^), 
daughter of Harman Yerkes by his wife Mary Stroud, was bom (probably in 
the Manor of Moreland) 19 June, 1755; died prior to 30 June, 1821; 
married, 28 March, 1782, Major Reading Howell, bom in Amwell Township, 
Hunterdon County, New Jersey, in 1743; died in Warminster, Bucks Owmty, 
Pennsylvania, 26 November, 1827; son of Daniel Howell by his wife Julianna 
Holcombe.* Major Howell was an eminent civil engineer, the profession of 
civil engineering having been the occupation of his grand-uncle, Governor 
John Reading. In the early part of the Revolution he served as quarter- 
master of the Second Regiment, Hunterdon County militia.f During the war 
he removed to Pennsylvania, and, 5 April, 1780, was commissioned deputy 
quartermaster-general of the Continental army, and stationed for duty in 
Chester County, Pennsylvania.:!: In 1789, the Assembly of that State adopted 
measures for improving the navigation of rivers and for the construction and 
improvement of public roads, and the Supreme Executive Council appointed 
commissioners to carry out these objects. On 2 October, 1789, Major Howell 
was appointed a commissioner to explore, survey, and make necessary drafts 
of the rivers Delaware and Lehigh, his co-commissioners being Colonel Tim- 
othy Matlack and Colonel William Dean.§ The work was immediately begun 
and promptly executed, as shown by a message sent by Governor Mifflin to the 
Assembly, 9 February, 1790, reporting that "the commissioners to view the 
river Delaware have completed the task assigned to them."|| The brief time 
in which the work was accomplished was no doubt largely due to the knowledge 
Major Howell possessed of the subject-matter of the investigation from 
having been engaged in making extensive surveys in the State and in pre- 
paring a map of the same. In the following year Major Howell received a 
similar appointment, when, under a resolution of the Assembly of 31 March, 
1790, he, with Colonel Frederick Antes and Colonel William Dean, were 
named by the Council as commissioners to explore the country near the head- 
waters of the Delaware River and east branch of the Susquehanna, and of

Major Howell's most important achievement, and that for which he is 
best known, is his Map of Pennsylvania. The earliest knowledge of the 
preparation of this map is gained from the message of the President and 
Supreme Executive Council to the General Assembly, imder date of 9 February, 
1790. The Assembly received the project with favor, and subsequently appro- 
priated three hundred potmds to enable Major Howell to proceed with his 
undertaking. The map was completed, and published in 1792. 

Major Howell was appointed Surveyor of Philadelphia in 1804, and held 
the office until his decease, when he was succeeded by Enoch Lewis, Esqi*. 
He was the engineer of Thomas Leiper in the construction of a railway in 
Delaware Coimty to connect Leiper's quarries with the waters of Ridley 
Creek. The railway was built in 1809, the second, if not the first, in the 
United States.f

which he erected on one of these tracts stood for nearly one hundred years, 
when it was torn down, its site being within a few yards of the Northeast 
Pennsylvania Railroad. It is said to have been the first smooth-dressed stone 
house in the county, and was built of large square blocks of sandstone, closely 
fitted together. He parted with some of his landed possessions during his 
lifetime, but at his death he owned the plantation mentioned in his will, which 
was on the west side of the York Road, and extended down to the coimty line. 
He was a member of the military organization of the State, and as early as

SI. HARM AN YERKES* (Harman*, Herman^, Anthony^), fourth son 
and eighth child of Harman Yerkes by his wife Mary Stroud, was bom in 
Warminster Township, Bucks County, 25 July, 1767; died there, 12 February, 
1837. He was a farmer, as had been his father, grandfather, and great- 
grandfather, and as were all of his brothers, and, like all these, he was also 
a land-owner. On 24 May, 1793, he purchased from his father the homestead 
tract of one hundred acres and ninety perches, lying partly on the Street Road, 
although the principal portion lay back of the tract of his brother, Stephen 
Yerkes, and was heavily wooded. In 1799 he built upon this tract the large 
stone bam still standing, and in 181 2 he erected the large stone mansion house, 
which still stands as perfect as the day it was built. 

In 1800 he purchased from his brother Stephen the balance of the one 
hundred and eighty-one acres that had belonged to the father. He later 
bought the " Job Noble tract," lying upon both sides of the York Road and 
along the County Line Road, and called the '^ Moland property," and also the 
farm lately owned by his grandson, Harman Yerkes Montanye. Mr. Yerkes 
was successful in the development of his real estate, and so prospered in all his 
worldly affairs that he came to be rated as a man of considerable wealth. 
He is said to have been the first farmer in his neighborhood to sell hay in the 
Philadelphia market. He died a large landed proprietor, and left to each of 
his children (except Edwin, who received the store at Centreville) a farm 
or its equivalent. 

He married, in 1790, Margaret Long, bom 8 January, 1771 ; died 4 
March, 1849; daughter of Captain Andrew Long* by his wife Mary Carr. 

* Captain Long was a son of Andrew and Mary Long, and was born about 1750, and died in 
Warrington Townsliip, Bucks County, 4 November, i8ia. On 6 April, 1776 he was commissioned a 
captain of a company in the Pennsylvania Rifle regiment, commanded by Colonel Samuel Miles, which 
position he resigned on account of ill health, 14 October, same year. In 1779 he was appointed a jus- 
tice of the peace and of the Courts of Common Pleas of Bucks, which office he held many years.

ship, Wayne County, Michigan, where he settled upon section two of township 
one south, range eight east, taking up the land from the government. " With 
axe and firebrand he soon made a clearing in the wilderness of forest, and 
planted his family hearthstone within the four walls of a settler's cabin. 
Though well advanced in years, and the father of a numerous family, he 
wrought with a strong arm, which soon transformed a dense forest into a 
beautiful and productive farm. . . . His life history, which possessed nothing 
that could be called thrilling or miraculous, has, nevertheless, an interest to all 
admirers of Michigan's pioneers, as well as those contemporary with his life 
and labors." ♦

of Moreland, 5 December, 1759; died at Damascus, Wayne County, Penn- 
sylvania, 27 March, 1835. He was a farmer and miller, and acquired his 
early knowledge of these occupations on the farm and in the mill of his step- 
father, John Nesmith, formerly the property of his father, who died when the 
son Jonathan was but three years of age. In 1789 Jonathan and his only 
brother Titus determined to form a copartnership and enter upon the milling 
business on their own accotmt, and on 18 June, of that year, they purchased 
two tracts of land in Germantown Township, one consisting of forty-seven 
acres, and the other, an adjoining tract, of twenty-two and one-quarter acres,* 
to which estate they removed, and there engaged in the milling business, 
pursuing the same imtil about 5 May, 1802,* on which date Jonathan Yerkes 
released and conveyed his half-interest in the land so purchased, and the mills 
on the same, tmto his brother Titus. 

At the time of this conveyance Jonathan Yerkes had, it is assumed, con- 
cluded to remove his family to and settle in Wayne County, Pennsylvania, 
as such removal was effected late the same year, or early in 1803. He pur- 
chased four hundred acres of land in Damascus Township, in the latter county, 
of Thomas Shields. The land was located on Calkins Creek, not far distant 
from the Delaware River, into which the creek emptied. Here he constructed 
a saw-mill, and later a grist-mill, and continued farming and milling until 
his death. 

Mr. Yerkes and his wife were Baptists, and, before moving to Wayne

his brother Jonathan, and joined with him in the purchase of an estate in 
Germantown, where they engaged in the milling business. In 1802 he pur- 
chased his brother's interest in this property, at which time, as it appears from 
the deed conveying such interest, he was residing in Lower Merion town- 
ship, Montgomery Coimty. Some years later he erected a mill for the manu- 
facture of cotton yams on land that had belonged to his father, at what was 
Yerkesville, and is now Terwood, in Moreland, and there pursued such manu- 
facture to the end of his life. He was for several years the proprietor of

marsh Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, 15 March, 1845. He 
was a merchant and farmer. Auge, in his " History of Montgomery County, 
p2tge 63, gives the following account of Mr. Yerkes's life : 



9f 



" His father, John Yerkes, was a farmer, who, finding his son, Harman, a delicate boy, 
hardly strong enough for his own calling, placed him at an early age with Samuel Livezey, 
of Plymouth, as a store help, where he remained a number of years. Having saved of his 
earnings fifty pounds, he concluded, under the advice of his patron friend Livezey, to start 
a store for himself at Spring Mill. The manner of his going into business is given in his 
own words, as related to the writer many years ago : ' Samuel said I served him faithfully, 
and he would assist me. He went with me to town and introduced me to the merchants, 
and said to them, " Harman is poor, but he is honest If he wants a little credit, trust him; 
but don't trust him too much, for much trust ain't good for a young man."' He soon,

however, had little need of trust from anybody, for till his death he was known in Phila- 
delphia as the 'money-down' buyer. After continuing several years at Spring Mill, he 
removed to the store and farm so long known by the name of ' Yerkes Corner/ now Harman- 
ville, at the intersection of the Ridge turnpike road and the Spring Mill road, where he died, 
universally respected, on March 15, 1845, at the ripe old age of seventy-one years. 

" Harman Yerkes was eminently a merchant of the olden time, disposing of everything 
at exact and uniform prices, and at very small advances. He would as soon have thought 
of selling with a short yardstick or false bushel as to retail goods on the modem sensational 
style,— one article at less than cost, and another, not so well known to the buyer, at three- 
fold profits. If goods would not bring their price, they remained on the shelves as mementos 
or as caution not to buy more. This, perhaps, was not best, but it was his way. Conse- 
quently, when his stock was finally closed out, very many things, well kept, were sold to 
buyers as curiosities of a former age. He was scrupulously honest to the half-penny. If a 
half -cent was due a customer on an account, or in change, he would, if no half -cent were at 
hand, give a half row of pins, or the like, to make precise settlement. With equal exactitude 
and conscientiousness he expected it if due him. In his later years he became wealthy, and 
loaned considerable money on bonds and mortgages, and, as may be supposed, knew or 
cared nothing for ' bonuses' in placing loans. Though living with Friends nearly all his life, 
and attending their meetings with tolerable regularity, he was never a member of the 
Sodety.** 

Harman Yerkes married, atx&gt;ut 1803, Elizabeth Weaver, bom 29 Sep- 
tember, 1 781; died 28 April, 1877; daughter of John Weaver, of German-

his mothef and step-father being members, in excellent standing, of Abington 
Meeting. He was carefully educated and prepared for a mercantile life, and 
finally determined to enlarge his sphere of activity by abandoning the country 
and establishing himself in business in Philadelphia, whence he removed 
about 1808, and where he engaged as a flour and feed merchant, in which he 
prospered. After acquiring a handsome fortune he retired from business. 

At the time of his removal to Philadelphia he was a member of the Abing- 
ton Monthly Meeting of Friends, and upon his removal he attached himself to 
the Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia for the Northern District. 
He was a man of positive views, and was firm in maintaining them. As to his 
character in these respects, we obtain a shade of light in the following extract 
from the minutes of the Meeting last mentioned : 

"Silas Yerkes, who had a right of membership with us, the religious Society of 
Friends, has transgressed our Discipline by persisting with others in holding a Meeting 
Styled the Monthly Meeting of Friends held at Green Street, Philadelphia, after that 
Meeting had been dissolved by the Quarterly Meeting and the members thereof attached to 
the Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia for the Northern District : Also by attend- 
ing other Meetings held in violation of our established Order. — On these accounts it became 
our concern to treat with him in order to convince him of his errors, but he denied the 
authority of the Monthly Meeting, and refused to see the committee appointed to confer 
with him. Having thus separated himself from the religious Society of Friends, we testify 
we no longer consider him a member among us — ^nevertheless desire that through the renewed 
visitations of Divine Grace he may be favoured to see and condenm his errors and prepared 
to unite with us in christian fellowship." 

He married, 13 March, 1806, Mary Leech; bom in Cheltenham town- 
ship, Montgomery County, 26 Jtme, 1786; died at Philadelphia, 25 July, 1858;

I 170. REVEREND STEPHEN YERKES, D.D.» (Stephen*, Harman*, 

\ Herman*, Anthon)r^), youngest son and fourth child of Stephen Yerkes by 

his wife Alice Watson, was bom in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 27 June, 

1 81 7; died at Danville, Kentucky, 28 March, 1896. His father dying during 

i his childhood, he was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, Harman 

I Yerkes, by whom he was carefully educated. Having received all that could 

be obtained in the way of education at home and at the country schools, he 
/ was sent to a classical academy near Philadelphia. There he remained for 

three years; and in 1833, ^^ ^^^ ^S^ of sixteen, entered the freshman class at 
Yale College, from which he was graduated in 1837. Among his classmates 
were Chief Justice Waite, Honorable William M. Evarts, Professor Edwar'd 
Silliman, and Honorable Edwards Pierpont. A few months after graduation 
Hr. Yerkes went to Baltimore, Maryland, where he engfaged in teaching, a 
work which, along varied lines and steadily ascending planes, he was so faith- 
fully to prosecute for nearly sixty years. He connected himself with the church 



YERKES FAMILY 



of which Reverend Robert J. Breckenridge, D.D., was pastor, under whose 
direction he studied theology. In 1840 he was licensed to preach, and was 
ordained to the ministry in 1843. He became pastor of the Chestnut Grove 
church, and afterwards of the Bethel church, in the Presbytery of Baltimore, 
and was for some years at the head of a classical academy which he established 
in Baltimore G^unty. In 1851, in response to an urgent call from the Tran- 
sylvania University, in Lexington, Kentucky, he became Professor of Greek 
in that institution, which position he retained until 1857, when, by a unani- 
mous vote of the Presbyterian General Assembly, which met that year in Lex- 
ington, he was elected to the chair of Hebrew and Oriental Languages, in the 
new theological seminary located at Danville in that State, which position he 
filled with distinction for nearly forty years. W. C. Young, of Danville, Ken- 
tucky, thus writes of Mr. Yerkes in the Presbyterian of 15 April, 1896: 

"The professor's chair was Dr. Yerkes's throne. The subject-matter of the depart- 
ment over which he was placed, Hebrew, is, as is well known to the average theological 
student, difficult and dry, but ever3rthing which an accomplished and gifted instructor could 
do to render its study profitable and interesting was done by Dr. Yerkes. An accurate and 
detailed knowledge of the subject brought a comprehensive and intelligent view of its rela- 
tion and surroundings. Great patience, never-failing courtesy and kindness, a real, deep, 
personal interest in each one of his students, — these qualities were possessed by him in an 
eminent degree. They made him a model professor, and secured for him the respect, 
attention, and affection of all of his students. Nothing could be more beautiful, nor more 
characteristic of the man, than the relations he sustained with his old pupils, — with many 
of them, as an adviser and friend, he maintained a constant correspondence. And none 
ever returned to Danville without calling at his hospitable home, and receiving from him 
a warm and affectionate welcome. 

" While the Seminary was Dr. Yerkes's chief field of labor, yet he was deeply interested 
in, and rendered valuable service to, the literary institution so closely connected with it, 
Centre College. Long before, and during the whole of my official relations with the college. 
Dr. Yerkes belonged to its governing board; for at least one year he taught a number of 
its classes, and in numberless ways showed that its interests came next to his heart to those 
of his own special institution, regarding the college as the natural feeder for the seminary, 
as, indeed, it has always been. 

" The intercourse of Dr. Yerkes, with the place he occupies in the hearts of the faculty 
and students of the seminary, his friends and the citizens of the town during these latter 
years, no words of mine can adequately express. How gentle and considerate of others, 
how wise in counsel, how affable and courteous in manner, how tender and sympathetic, 
how liberal and open-handed in beneficence! How we loved and reverenced him! He was 
our representative Christian gentleman. When he was taken from us, all felt that Danville 
had lost one of her best possessions and each one of us had lost a friend. 

** During the funeral services, conducted by his colleagues, all the business houses and 
banks of the town were dosed, and the solemnity of every countenance evidenced the sorrow 
that was in every heart'

244. WILLIAM YERKES*^ (Joseph*, Stephen*, Herman^ Anthony*), 
eldest child of Joseph Yerkes by his wife Mary Purdy, was bom in Moreland, 
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, 11 September, 1794; died at Novi, Mich- 
igan, 5 January, 1884. In his early childhood he accompanied his parents, 
upon their removal from Pennsylvania, to Romulus, New York, and remained 
at the latter place until his removal to, and settlement in, Michigan. In 1819 
he was commissioned ensign in the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Regiment 
of New York militia. Of his life in Michigan, Elias S. Woodman, Esqr, in 
his paper printed in the " Proceedings of the Pioneer Society of Michigan," 
thus writes : 

"William Yerkes, in company with his cousin, Thomas Pinkerton, early in the ]rear 
1825, journeyed on foot from Ovid, New York, through Canada, by way of Chatham, Hamil- 
ton, and Detroit, to the township of Farmington, Michigan, in search of farming lands. . . . 
Mr. Yerkes selected sections 35 and 36 in this township, while others of his party chose tracts 
near by. This done, they returned by the s^me route on foot to New York, where they 
remained till March, 1826, when they again set out on foot through Canada for their chosen 
home in the West. Their families came on late in company with Joseph Yerkes, the venerable 
father of William, and arrived May 14. . . . William Yerkes was soon appointed territorial 
justice of the peace by General Cass, which he held through many terms. He held many 
offices of honor and trust in the township and county. In 1838 he was a member of the State 
Legislature, and again in 1857 and 1858, voting for the five million dollar loan negotiated in 
1838 and 1839. My acquaintance with William Yerkes dates from May, 1837, to the time 
of his death, January 5, 1884, then in the ninetieth year of his age. Through all these years 
have I been a witness of his unswerving rectitude and inborn integrity. A man whose counsel 
was sought for, whose judgment was just and timely, and whose sympathies and help were 
a comfort in those troublous times. He can be said to be one of Michigan's pioneers in the 
broadest sense of the term. I have heard him relate how he was accustomed to go on foot 
from his home in Novi to Detroit, while a member of the Legislature, taking perhaps in his 
hand a change of clothing, and a slice of com bread and venison in his pocket, and at the 
close of the session to return home in the same way, and think it no hardship." 

Mr. Yerkes was a member of the Oakland Cotmty Pioneer Society. He 
married, 5 November, 181 7, Hester Dennis, bom in New Jersey, 21 March,

CHRONICXE OF THE 



1799; died at Novi, Michigan, 11 September, 1881; daughter of Joseph 
Dennis by his wife Sarah Miller. At the " Golden Wedding^' of Mr. and 
Mrs. Yerkes, their son, Robert Yerkes, Esq^, read the following poem, com- 
posed by him: 

LIHIS WBITTIN BY KOBEKT YERKXS, AND BEAD BY HIM AT THB GOLDEN WBDDINO OF HIS FATHBK 

AND MOTHIS, NOVEMBER 5, 1867. 

** We meet, my friends, on this November day, 
Recalling time full fifty years away; 
Time when these fading locks proclaim their age 
First ventured on the matrimonial stage ; 
And waiving each their separate hopes and fears, 
Joined hand and heart, for all their future years. 

** And as we gather round this roof-tree old. 
Let us the story of their passing life unfold ; 
Even as the far landscape, the wide prairies through, 
Lifts no deep chasm or rugged mountain into view ; 
And as the traveller's feet glide o'er the many miles. 
At first the plain is bright, with springtide's joyous smiles ; 
But soon a deep ravine has cleft his road in twain; 
And then an ascent, up which the toil seems vain. 
And briery untried paths go all the region through. 
And cutting winds, where fancy's softest zeph3rrs blew. 

" 'Tis so in life ; and he who in its morning forward peers 
Sees nought but green old age undimmed by falling tears. 
And when he backward glances as strength gives place to age. 
Sees the whole voyage writ on sorrow's sombre page. 

" The words that made ' These Twain' one flesh as long as life shall last 
Are mingled with things that make the far-off past ; 
But memory, flying back, has gathered one by one. 
Their trials past, their little victories won. 
And holds them on her fleeting wings to-day. 
That we may weave them in our unpretending lay. 

** When once they faced the scenes of active life, 
They waged with poverty relentless strife. 
Hard labor as their lot, they could but deem ; 
Which way they looked, there came no answering gleam 
That bade them on life's ocean idly drift, 
To wait for fortune without work or thrift 

" To earn a livelihood, the wife her shuttle plied. 
The husband pushed his boat upon the Mohawk's tide, 
And next a small wild farm they try to tame, 
A farm so small, it scarce deserved the name ; 
This sold, with small accretions, served a larger farm to buy 
Qose where Cayuga's sparkling waters lie; 

80 



YERKES FAMILY 



On this, although enough for present wants they gain, 
They ne'er could hope a rising family to maintain; 
Their little children from their native hearth must roam. 
Or they must seek in Western wilds a more productive home. 

" Not then as now ; the curtain of the wilderness was down. 
And all the West lay deeply shaded in its frown; 
None ventured there, save hunter free and wild. 
Or yeoman strong with hope of future home beguiled; 
But stem necessity in nature knows no law. 
And often serves on those who grieve a happier fate to draw. 

"To build a woodland home the husband goes before. 
And soon the wife comes after with her children four; 
Upon Lake Erie's wave ten days her strength was tried, 
Her sickened children tossed from side to side, 
With ceaseless cry, naught but a mother's love could bide. 

" And when they landed on that strange wild shore. 
Although their friends were there, their trials were not o'er; 
The rutted road, unlike the smooth-laid rail. 
The woodland road, soon ending in an Indian trail, 
Was the highway through which their future home they found, 
Where densest forests stretched and lowered around. 

" And now against the mighty woodland foe. 
Whose close-drawn lines, outstretching row on row, 
Held the broad acres with his ruthless ban. 
The tug of stem, relentless war began. 
A hopeless war it seemed, and hard to brook 
For those who on that stately forest look. 

" Just where we meet beneath this sheltering roof 
High up the oak-trees threw their web and woof; 
Where yonder golden-fmited orchard stands 
The wildwood held in thickly plaited bands ; 
Out on yon fields, now of their verdure bare. 
The gray wolf made his ambuscade and lair. 

"But lo! the woodman's axe, with steady peal. 
Makes the dense ranks in wild confusion reel ; 
The cumbrous trunks are thrown in many angled aisles. 
The brush is tossed in huge fantastic piles; 
The blazing fire, like sea of molten brass. 
Next turns to ashes the rough chaotic mass ; 
While round the stumpy field the zigzag fences rise. 
And springing grain quick greets the fanner's eyes. 

" Thus year by year, when for the furrow space they lack, . 
With skilful hands they push the forest back, 
Until the fraction left is saved for future use. 
When to the silvan war they bid a lasting tnsce.

CHRONICLE OF THE 



" Think not this drudgery fast binds the pioneer, 
For country pastimes oft served his lot to cheer; 
The bee lined straight from where his robber instinct led. 
That larger thieves might share his winter's bread. 

" The hunter's stealthy step along the bushy swale, 
The noiseless deer, back gazing on his trail; 
The fevered thrill, defjring doctors' laws; 
The rifle's crack, the instant breathless pause, 
The disappointed scowl if he bounds unhurt away. 
Or exultant cry if staggering marks the bullet's prey. 

"The sturdy neighbors gathered far and near. 
The log house raising and the housewife's cheer. 
The husking-bee drawn late into the night, 
The hearty laugh, the healthy, happy faces bright. 

"These and kindred pastimes, mingled with their toil. 
Kept guard against despondency's recoil; 
In some or most of these they had their share. 
Whose guests to-day we freely welcome are; 
Perhaps they had their share of sorrow too, 
Although to right their hearts were leal and true. 
For up the long course through which their lives have spun 
Full many a day of anxious care has run. 
And deep affliction drove its furrow through. 
Hiding three children from their earthly view. 

"But thanks to Him we give whose Spirit's power 
Upheld them in the pain of trial's gloomy hour ; 
Thankful stem poverty led not their feet astray. 
Or affluence lured them in the worldling's gilded way; 
Thankful not o'er much sorrow turned them to despair. 
Or joy made them oblivious of others' need and care. 
And thankful to Him who year by year has held disease at bay, 
Till now we greet them on their Golden Wedding Day.

year. To Mrs. Yerkes fell the responsibility and task of rearing and main-* 
taining their ten minor children. She was a woman of remarkable energy 
and intelligence, and met the responsibility thus cast upon her with the 
courage of a Spartan mother. One correspondent, in writing of her in this 
connection, says, ''Mrs. Yerkes reared her family in such a way that, in 
whatever community they have cast their lot, they have left a mark for up- 
rightness, temperance, and morality. Some of them have reached positions of 
prominence above their fellow-men. . . . She was far-seeing and wise above 
her generation. She w^ the good angel in the community wherever she lived. 
Men of letters, physicians, and ministers sought her advice and counsel."

publishing a history of the Yerkes family, and for more than forty-five years 
prior to his death he assiduously devoted the greater part of his leisure hours 
in the gathering of materials for such a work. It was the favorite scheme of 
his life, and but for his hearty devotion to the name Yerkes, and his timely 
energy, many of the names and facts which find a place in this publication 
would now be unobtainable. The work he accomplished is so highly valued 
by the present writer that he finds great pleasure in noting that the memory 
of Mr. Yerkes deserves a kindly place in the hearts of all of his kinsmen. 

Mr. Yerkes resided at Fox Chase, where he was engaged in the manu-

boards, February, 1898; March, 1898, chairman light-house board, and superintendent of 
Naval Academy, July, 1898, till relieved by Commander Richard Wainwright" 

Although the name of Rear-Admiral McNair is not associated in the 
minds of the general public with any great naval achievements during the 
Spanish-American war, it was he who, for three years prior to being relieved 
by Admiral Dewey, commanded the American naval forces on the Asiatic 
station, and to him belongs much of the credit for the victories in Manila Bay. 
It was by his persistent drilling and careful instruction that the gunners of 
the Asiatic squadron had been brought to so high a grade of proficiency, a 
prime factor, as Admiral Dewey has himself declared, in the satisfactory result 

xa8 



YERKES FAMILY 



of the first and greatest contest of the war. To Admiral McNair must also 
be given much of the credit for the excellent condition of the vessels that 
Admiral Dewey was called to command. 

If fate, that plays such a great part in the creation of battle heroes, denied 
to Admiral McNair his opportunity in our last war, he had as varied an expe- 
rience and left as brilliant a record as any American naval officer of the present 
day. He held stations in almost every part of the world, and was an eye- 
witness and student of several European contests. He was with Garibaldi in 
Italy, and his mind was well stored with the scientific principles of war. He 
was in active service throughout the Civil War, and during those bloody years 
won glory enough for one life. His death created a vacancy at the top of the 
list of active rear-admirals in the American navy. 

He died at Washington, D. C, 28 November, 1900; married, 9 October, 
1862, Qara, daughter of James William Warren by his wife Mary Sellars

Kentucky, in 1873, when he received the d^jee of A.B., and in 1876 
that of A.M. After leaving college he entered upon the study of the law 
at the Law Department of the University of Michigan, and was graduated 
therefrom in 1877, receiving the d^jee of LL.B. Immediately thereafter he 
engaged in the practice of his profession at Danville, Kentucky, and was ap- 
pointed Raster in Bankraptcy. Since 1880 he has been prominently identified 
with the legal, educational, commercial, and industrial interests of his town 
and State. In addition to being officially connected with various banking 
and commercial institutions, Mr. Yerkes. is a member of the faculty of the 
Law Department of Centre College, and was president of the State Com- 
mercial and Industrial Convention held at Louisville, Kentucky, and a com- 
missioner to the Columbian and Atlanta Expositions. He served as master

in chancery from 1888 tintil 1902, and in 1897 was appointed Collector of 
Internal Revenue for the Eighth District of Kentucky, by President McKinley, 
who, in December, 1900, appointed him Commissioner of Internal Revenue at 
Washington, D. C, which position he now holds under President Roosevelt. 

Mr. Yerkes is a Republican both by inheritance and choice. He was 
chairman of the Republican State Committee of Kentucky from 1891 until 
1896, and occupied that position when the State elected its first Republican 
governor, secured control of the Legislature, and increased its representation in 
Congress and on the State Court of Appeals bench. Since 1896 he has been a 
member of the Republican National Committee from Kentucky. In 1900 
Mr. Yerkes was unanimously nominated for governor by the largest State 
convention ever held by his party in Kentucky, and although it was a Presi- 
dential year, and therefore brought out the entire Democratic vote, he was 
defeated by only three thousand five hundred votes, leading the Republican 
electoral ticket by three thousand, and receiving nearly forty thousand more 
votes than any Republican nominee for governor of Kentucky ever received. 

Central University, the largest and oldest collie of Kentucky, has con- 
ferred upon Mr. Yerkes the degree of LL.D., and in Jime, 1903, he was 
elected a member of the Board of Trustees of that institution. He is a director 
of the Farmers' National Bank of Danville, the Danville Gaslight Company, 
and the Wholesale Grocery Company, and while practising law he was attorney 
for the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railroad Company, and 
other corporations. Since 1900 he has resided at Washington. 

He married at Danville, 10 October, 1879, Elizabeth Owsley Anderson, 
bom at Danville, 4 March, 1854; daughter of Honorable William C. Ander- 
son by his wife Amelia Owsley Rodes.

October 1829; died at Phoenixville, 10 March, 1890; daughter of William 
Ivester by his wife Anna Maria Renshaw. 

The following notice of Dr. Yerkes appeared in the Phoenixville Mes- 
senger, the day after his death : 

X31 



CHRONICLE OF THE 



; 



".This community was very much startled, indeed, to learn, on Tuesday morning, 
of the sudden death of Doctor Harman Yerkes, one of the old residents of the town, and 
known to everybody. At first the story was, he was found dead in bed that morning; but 
that was not true, as his death took place Monday nifl^t shortly after the mid-hour, and in 
the presence of his family. That day he had been attending to his patients as usual, and 
went to bed complaining of excessive pains in the breast This was caused by heart hilure^ 
and in an hour or so he had joined the silent multitude. 

" Dr. Yerkes was bom on the 4th of September, 1820, near Hatboro, and when at the 
proper age went to the Hatboro Academy. When eighteen years old he went to Philadelphiat 
and engaged with W. P. Anspach &amp; Son, dry-goods merchants, on North Third Street 
Tiring of that business, he returned to Hatboro, studied medicine with Dr. Hill, attended 
lectures at the Jefferson Medical G&gt;llege, graduated in March, 1847, and moved to Phoenix- 
ville^ July of the same year, and here he has been in continuous practice ever since. Of the 
personality of the deceased and of his character as a citizen, we are not called to speak, 
as the one and the other are so well known as to render anything additional seem unneces- 
sary. If he had an enemy, we never heard of it, and that he was a good, kind man to 
those whose circumstances were limited is a well-known unwritten page of the history of 
this town. His memory will be cherished as a gentleman and a Christian. Dr. Yerkes stood 
well with his fellow-dtizens, as may be realized from the fact that he served three terms in 
the school board, of which he was secretary many years, and one term as Burgess. He was 
a candidate for this position as a Republican in 1863, against Levi Oberholtzer, Democrat, 
when the contest, for special reasons well known, was very bitter. The town was Demo- 
cratic, and the vote stood two hundred and fifteen for Oberholtzer and two hundred and 
one for Yerkes. Physically the deceased was a fine specimen of manhood until within 
the past ten years, when evidences of decadence were marked." 

The year in which Dr. Yerkes was elected Burgess was the year after he 
had been defeated by Dr. Oberholtzer, and his victory when elected was an 
overwhelming one.

542. THOMAS MONTANYE YERKES« (Stephen^ Harman*, Har-

Amy Hart Montanye, was bom in Warminster Township, Bucks County, 14 
November, 1831. At the age of nineteen years he emigrated to California, 
working his way there, and enduring many hardships. He drove a team across 
the plains for the famous Kit Carson, and worked a number of years for the 
Mormons at Salt Lake City. In 1856, being then in California, he accompanied 
a party, imder the leadership of Colonel Charles W. Stone, upon a secret mis- 
sion from the United States to Mexico. He resided for some time in Mexico, 
and from thence he went to Arizona, where, during the Civil War, he was 
Government Superintendent to the Mowry Silver-Mines. After the war he 
became extensively engaged in mining and milling ventures in Arizona and 
Mexico. He has had several narrow escapes in Indian fights, and altogether 
has led an adventurous life. He is unmarried. 

544. STEPHEN YERKES® (Stephen^ Harman*, Harman», Herman*,

Harman*, Herman*, Anthony*), fifth son and sixth child of Stephen Yerkes 
by his wife Amy Hart Montanye, was bom in Warminster Township, Bucks 
County, 8 October, 1843. ^^' Yerkes enjoyed the advantages of a liberal 
education, and after graduating at a school at East Hampton, Massachusetts, 
in 1862, he taught school for a short time, and then entered upon the study 
of law in the office of Judge Ross at Doylestown. He was admitted to the 
bar in Bucks Coimty, 3 November, 1865, and at once began a successful pro- 
fessional career. In 1868 he was elected District Attorney, and served in that 
office with marked ability. In 1873 he was nominated for the State Senate by 
the Democrats of the Bucks-Northampton District, and was elected by an over- 

134

whelming majority, and was re-elected from Bucks County in 1876, run- 
ning far ahead of his ticket in each instance. He soon became prominent 
among the distinguished Democratic leaders who made the Senate of that 
period a notable one. He served upon the Judiciary, Federal Relations, 
Finance, and Centennial Affairs committees, and was chosen by his col- 
leagues a member of the State Board of Managers of the Centennial Ex- 
position, in the advancement of which he took an active and prominent 
part. In 1877 he presided over the Democratic legislative caucus to 
nominate a candidate for United States Senator, which nominaton was 
proffered him, but declined in favor of his friend. Honorable Andrew H. 
Dill. He was also unanimously selected by his party colleagues for Presi- 
dent of the Senate. He was the draughtsman of the laws regulating the 
separate Orphans' Courts, the Civil and Criminal Courts of the State and 
of the city of Philadelphia, in compliance with the Constitution of 1874, and 
which, after a trial of twenty-eight years, remain substantially as they were 
first enacted. Probably the most notable and important service rendered by 
Judge Yerkes during his term in the State Senate was the introduction and 
persistent advocacy of the law creating the Hospital for the Insane at Nor- 
ristown, the largest charitable institution in the State, if not in the country, 
and which owes much of its success to the efforts of Judge Yerkes. He was 
one of the first trustees selected for its government, and, being a member of 
the Committee on By-Laws, contributed greatly to bringing about the organi- 
zation which, for the first time in this country, completely separated the male 
and female departments, an experiment which has proved eminently successful. 
Judge Yerkes frequently represented his county in Democratic State Conven- 
tions, and for several years was a member of the Democratic State Committee. 
In 1872 he was one of the youngest delegates upon the floor of the Democratic 
National Convention at Baltimore, and was among the twenty-one del^;ates 
who persistently voted against the nomination of Horace Greeley, and in favor 
of that great apostle of Democratic principles. Judge Jeremiah S. Black, for 
President. In 1880 he was again a delegate to the National Convention at 
Cincinnati, where, although a warm friend of Samuel J. Tilden, he was a 
conspicuous supporter of General Winfield Scott Hancock for President, to 
whom he felt he owed allegiance, because of the general's birth and residence 
in the same Congressional District, in Montgomery County. He presided over 
the judiciary committees, organizing the Democratic Judicial Conventions for 
the counties of Bucks and Montgomery, comprising the Seventh District, in 
the years of 1869, 1871, and 1873, and was a del^;ate in each. In 1883, 
having declined a re-election to the Senate, Judge Yerkes was elected President 
Judge of the Courts of the Seventh Judicial District, leading his ticket nearly a 

t35

thousand votes. In 1893 he was re-elected by an equally flattering vote, 
having received the unanimous endorsement of the Bucks G)unty bar, and 
the declaration of the regular Republican Judicial Convention, that it was 
inexpedient to nominate a candidate against him. In 1895 he was one of the 
six Democratic nominees for the judges of the Superior Court, leading all his 
competitors in the convention at Williamsport, and upon the first ballot re- 
ceiving the votes of three hundred and forty-nine delegates out of a total of 
four hundred and fifty-four. At the election Judge Yerkes polled the second 
highest vote among the Democratic candidates, and ran ahead in the majority 
of the counties of the State, without any prejudice to his colleagues. Judge 
Yerkes's name was prominently mentioned in connection with the Democratic 
nomination for governor in 1882, and again in 1898, but he declined to become 
a candidate before the conventions. In 1901 he was unanimously nominated 
for Judge of the Supreme Court by the Democratic State Convention, and 
also received a unanimous nomination from the State Committee of the Union 
Republican Party, an independent Republican organization. Judge Yerkes 
came within forty thousand votes of an election. The previous year the 
Democratic ticket was defeated by a majority of 288,000. In Philadel- 
phia alone Judge Yerkes received 103,000 votes, 10,000 in excess of any 
previous vote of his party, and nearly 50,000 above the vote of his party ticket 
in the previous election for President. In 1903 he received from his party 
the unanimous nomination for a third term in the judgeship of Bucks County. 
By this time the county had become overwhelmingly Republican, and Judge 
Yerkes failed of re-election, although he ran several hundred votes ahead of 
his ticket, as he had done in all former instances in which he had been a candi- 
date for office. 

As a lawyer. Judge Yerkes hdd prominent rank at the bar, and as a judge, 
he enjoyed a deservedly high reputation throughout the State. On several 
occasions the bar of his county, by unanimous action, bore testimony to his 
ability, impartiality, int^prity, and independent judicial character, and his 
reputation as an exemplary judge became so widespread that he was frequently 
called upon to assist in trials in the courts of the State outside of his own 
district On one of these occasions he assisted in disposing of accumulated 
business in the Philadelphia courts, and at the close of such service he was 
highly commended for his work by the newspapers of that city. The Press, 
the leading Republican journal, said of him, " Judge Harman Yerkes, of Bucks 
County, has left a most admirable impression with all who have had any 
relations with the court. With high character and pronounced ability, he 
enjoys a quick perception, which enables him to measure promptly the im- 
portance of every question presented to him, and to facilitate business without

the least sacrifice of the dignity of the proceedings, so common in haste." 
Judge Yerkes, after twenty years service on the bench, returned to the practice 
of the law in January last, and will doubtless soon again occupy a prominent 
position at the bar of his native State. He is possessed of strong physique 
and a vigorous constitution, and continues in perfect health. He is a member 
of the State Bar Association, the Historical and Colonial societies of Pennsyl- 
vania, the Bucks County Historical Society, the Pennsylvania Scotch-Irish 
and German societies, the Art Club of Philadelphia, and the Acorn Club of 
Doylestown, and is Rector's Warden of St. Paul's Episcopal Church at Doyles-

Church. He has served as pastor of the Baptist Church of HoUidaysburg, 
Pennsylvania, the First Baptist Church of Pittsburg, the First Bap- 
tist Church of Brooklyn, New York, and the First Baptist Church of Plain- 
field, New Jersey, of which latter church he has been pastor since 1863. 
During his pastorate at Plainfield, the membership of his church has grown 
from two hundred and fifty to eight hundred and eighty-three, and the 
church is now recognized as one of the strongest in the denomination. In 
1874 Dr. Yerkes made a tour of Palestine and Europe, being absent eight 
months, and such was the kindness of his congr^;ation that they not only paid 
all the expenses of the trip, but continued his salary and supplied the pulpit 
during his absence. In June, 1902, after nearly forty years of service with the 
church, he was made Pastor Emeritus. 

Dr. Yerkes has ever exerted a wide influence for good, and he is still in 
vigorous mental activity. He is the oldest pastor in Plainfield, and is recog- 
nized in his denomination throughout the country as an able theologian. 

He married, 14 March, 1850, Sarah E. Taylor, bom at Charlton, Saratc^ 
County, New York, 30 November, 1826; daughter of Edward Taylor (who

the first call "to arms," was commissioned Quartermaster of the Fourth 
Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanded by Colonel John F. Hartranft, and 
served with his regiment until its term of enlistment (three months) expired. 
He again entered the service, and this time as major of the One Hundred and 
Seventy-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, to which position he was commissioned 
30 December, 1862, serving as such until 27 July, 1863, when his regiment 
was mustered out. Shortly afterwards he was appointed Provost Marshal of 
Montgomery County. At the close of the war he became a resident of Phila- 
delphia, and was admitted to the bar in that city. He subsequently became 
Assistant City Solicitor, and Solicitor to the Fairmount Park Commission, in 
which latter capacity he was serving when, on i July, 1876, by the appoint- 
ment of Governor Hartranft, his old military commander, he took his scat 
as Associate Judge of the Court of Common Pleas No. 3, of Philadelphia 
County, to fill the vacancy in that court caused by the death of Judge Lynd, 
and a few weeks later he was made the nominee of the Republican party for 
the same position. This nomination was ratified at the polls at the following 
November election, and in January, 1 877, Judge Yerkes entered upon the new 
term of office to which he had been elected, and continued his judicial career 
until his death. " He was a patient, learned, and laborious judge. The conten- 
tions of the court-room and the pains of impaired health never rufiled the 
serenity of his manner, and in his demise the community lost an able magistrate, 
and the bar an ever affable and sympathetic friend." * He was a member of 
the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal L^on of 
the United States and the Union League of Philadelphia. 

Judge Yerkes married, 24 November, 1868, Wilhelmine Elizabeth Hurst, 
bom at Philadelphia, 13 August, 1842; daughter of Alfred Hurst by his wife

Mr. Cook was graduated from the Central High School in 1862, and 
almost immediately began a mercantile career, associating himself with an 
elder brother in the importing business in Philadelphia. The development of 
Uiis business, which assumed large proportions, occupied his attention until 
1887. He then became interested in the management of financial institutions, 
and in 1887 was elected president of the Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe

Dq)osit Company. The business of this company grew so rapidly that its 
stock advanced from five dollars to one hundred and twenty dollars per share. 
In 1890, having then been for a short time a member of the board of directors 
of the Guarantee Trust and Safe Deposit Company, he was elected to the 
position of president of that institution. He resigned the presidency of the 
Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit Company, his friend, kinsman, 
and business associate, George H. Earle, Jun*", taking that position, and Mr. 
Cook filling the position of vice-president. He is still president of the Ciuaran- 
tee Trust and Safe Deposit Company, and also (1903) fills the positions of 
chairman of the finance committees of the Market Street National Bank, the 
Tradesmen's National Bank, and the Finance Company of Pennsylvania ; vice- 
president of the Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit Company, and 
secretary of the Board of Trustees of the George W. South Memorial Church 
of the Advocate. 

In 1885, as chairman of the building committee of the board of trustees 
of said church, and also as the secretary and treasurer of the board, Mr. Cook 
largely contributed to the successful prosecution of the work embraced in the 
erection of the noble group of buildings which stands at the northwest comer 
of Eighteenth and Diamond Streets. The expenditures in connection with 
this work amounted to about one million dollars, which money was furnished 
by the widow and the only daughter of the late George W. South, whose 
executor Mr. Cook had been. Competent judges pronounce these buildings the 
finest specimens of Gothic architecture in North America. They will compare 
favorably with similar buildings anywhere.

Comfort, was born at Honey Valley, near Spring Mill, Montgomery County, 
28 August, 1830; married, 15 October, 1856, Letitia Thomas Jarrett, bom 
at Horsham, Pennsylvania, 13 January, 1832; died at Moorestown, New 
Jersey, 7 August, 1892; daughter of Charles Jarrett by his wife Hannah 
Maulsby. Mr. Yerkes was educated at the Westtown Boarding School, 
Chester County, and upon leaving school he became a clerk in a store at West 
Chester. In 1850 he went to Philadelphia, where he took a clerkship in the 
house of Jenkins &amp; Co., tea merchants, and ten years later he became the 
junior partner of the house of Charles E. Hill &amp; Co., tea importers, and 
inspected all tea purchased by that firm. His knowledge of the quality of 
teas was so great that his partners desirecf to establish a purchasing house in 
China, and to send Mr. Yerkes there to conduct its business. They offered 
to deposit one hundred thousand dollars with a London banking firm for the 
use of the house in China, but Mr. Yerkes declined the proposition, thinking 
that he was too young a man to assume so great a responsibility, and because 
he was unwilling to go and reside in a land that seemed to him uncivilized. 
The business of his firm was later removed to New York, and Mr. Yerkes 
withdrew as a partner, and became engaged in the canning of fruits and 
vegetables at Moorestown, New Jersey, where he conducted that business for 
the house of H. K. Thurber &amp; Co., of New York. He retired from that busi- 
ness in 1892, and has resided since that time at Moorestown.

1858; married, 18 September, 1883, Mary Dilworth, bom at Leavenworth, 
Kansas, 8 January, 1863; daughter of James Ronaldson Dilworth by his wife 
Alice Elizabeth Macauley. 

Mr. Yerkes, upon the death of his father, was apprenticed to a farmer in 
Warminster, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in 1868. Like all " bound boys" 
at that time, he received only such an education as three months at a country 
school afforded. When fourteen years of age he ran away from the farm, 
and after a varied and fruitful experience of several weeks as a newsboy, pro- 
cured a position in a large cotton-mill. The panic of 1873 compelled him 
to leave that work and seek other employment, which he found in the Public 
Spirit office at Hatboro, Pennsylvania. In the spring of 1876, with just 
enough money to purchase a ticket to Glencoe, Minnesota, he landed at that 
place, almost penniless and without a friend, and failing to find employment 
in the printing-office there, he went to work on a farm, but finally obtained a 
situation at type-setting. In September he was offered a similar situation at 
Alexandria, Minnesota, to which place he went in a stage-coach, on money 
borrowed from the publisher he worked for. This man had money to lend him, 
at a good rate of interest, but utterly refused to pay the wages that were due. 

In 1878, soon after the Custer Massacre, young Yerkes went to Fort 
Standing Rock, Dakota, with a herd of cattle for the Sioux Indians. The 
trip was a hazardous one of two months, during which an attack from In- 
dians was daily expected. It was made without loss of life, and created a 
desire on the part of the subject of this sketch to see Westem life on the frontier. 
So, in 1879, he went to Miles City, then the outpost of civilization. This town

existed upon the earnings of buffalo-hunters, who were then killing buffalo 
by the thousands for their hides alone, and it was probably at that time the 
" roughest" town in the United States. In 1882 he established the Post, a 
small weekly paper at Coulson (now Billings), Montana, and conducted the 
same for six months, when he sold it and removed to Bozeman, where he 
aided in starting the Bozeman Weekly Chronicle. In 1884 he purchased this 
paper, and edited and conducted it several years, " in the interest of himself 
and the Democratic party." He now resides at Seattle, Washington, where 
he is engaged in the printing and publishing business, under the name of 
Yerkes Printing Company.

1 167. CHARLES TYSON YERKES^ (Charles Tyson*, Silas', Silas*, 
John', Herman*, Anthony^), second son and second child of Charles Tyson 
Yerkes by his wife Elizabeth Link Broom, was born at Philadelphia, 25 June, 
1837. He was educated at the Friends' School and the Central High School 
of his native city, and began his business life as a clerk in the flour and grain 
commission and forwarding house of James P. Perot &amp; Brother. He worked 
at first without salary, as in those days it was esteemed a great privil^;e to 
enter a first-class house, but on account of close attention to business, he was 
presented by his employers with fifty dollars at the end of the first year. 

In 1859 h^ Z^^^ up ^^ clerkship, and made his first independent business 
venture, opening a stock-broker's office. Three years later he purchased a 
banking house at No. 20 South Third Street, making as a specialty the 
negotiation of first-class bonds. During the Civil War he dealt heavily in 
government. State, and city bonds. In the latter part of this period the city 
of Philadelphia found itself in stress for moneys to meet obligations growing 
out of its large requirements to raise and equip its troops for the war, and to 
pay for its extensive land purchases in connection with the enlargement of its 
park. To meet this emergency, the city found it necessary to issue a large 
amount of bonds, but when issued, it was discovered that they could not be 
sold at their par value. The law did not allow of sales at less than par, so 
the raising of money by this means was brought to a stand-still. At this 
critical juncture Mr. Yerkes conceived a plan to raise the price of the bonds 

191 



CHRONICLE OF THE 



from eighty-five per cent, (the amount then bid for the same) to par, which 
plan was accepted by the City Treasurer, and proved successful, to the great 
relief of the city's financial straits. The close alliance then formed with the 
city proved, however, ultimately disastrous to Mr. Yerkes. The financial 
panic of 1871, caused by the Chicago fire, caught him carrying a large quan- 
tity of securities, and heavily in debt to the city for bonds sold on its account 
It had been the custom to make settlement with the city at the end of each 
month, but the authorities, in their fright over the possible effects of the 
panic, demanded from Mr. Yerkes immediate settlement He firmly refused 
to comply with this demand, as by so doing he would give the city preference 
over his other creditors, and this he was unwilling to do. The city still in- 
sisting on immediate payment, he made an assignment for the benefit of all 
of his creditors, and thus was lost the accumulation of years. 

Some months later, however, encouraged by prominent bankers and other 
financial men (who continued their faith in his honor and integrity as a 
business man), Mr. Yerkes resimied the banking business, and from the start 
began to recuperate his losses, but particularly so in 1873, at the time of the 
Jay Cooke failure. Appreciating at once that this failure meant a serious 
decline in all securities, Mr. Yerkes sold stocks heavily, and later bought them 
back at much lower prices than those for which he had sold them. This en- 
abled him to realize immense profits. 

After Mr. Yerkes resumed business. City Cotmcils, recognizing the great 
service that he had rendered the municipality financially, in the past, and the 
injury done him when the authorities forced him into insolvency, passed an 
ordinance absolving him from all indebtedness to the city. So soon as Mr. 
Yerkes had retrieved his fortune sufficiently to justify the step, he called his 
old creditors together and paid them in full. 

Very early in his business career he identified himself with street passen- 
ger railways. When he was only twenty-two years old, he, with others, 
bought a controlling interest in the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Streets Pas- 
senger Railway Company, of Philadelphia. He took a deep interest in the 
management of the road, and contributed largely to its success as a carrier 
of passengers, as well as to its permanent prosperity. From time to time 
he increased his holdings of the capital stock, and at about the time of his 
failure he was the largest individual stockholder in the company, which in- 
terest was sacrificed through his suspension. In 1875 he acquired a large 
interest in the Continental Passenger Railway Company, of the same city, 
with the result that the stock afterwards rose from fifteen to over one hun- 
dred dollars per share. Such connections were but the initial steps which 
led him later to engage himself with similar interests, so extensively and 

193

successfully as to gain for him great prominence in the financial world, and 
almost world-wide fame. 

In 1880 Mr. Yerkes made a tour through the Northwest, during which 
he made his first visit to Chicago. At that time, although gold was coming 
from Europe by almost every steamer to New York, money was not plentiful 
in the metropolis, and inquiry proved that it was going West, principally to 
Chicago. On his tour he stopped at Fargo, North Dakota, and, becoming in- 
terested in the rapid growth of that country, he joined an improvement syndi- 
cate there, of which he later became sole owner. He bought heavily of land 
and built business blocks, and was successful in organizing the first fair held 
in North Dakota. He subsequently sold most of his Dakota interests. 

In the Autumn of 1881 he went to Chicago, and established a banking 
house at the comer of La Salle and Madison Streets. In 1886 he opened 
negotiations for the control of the Chicago street railways, and, in associa- 
tion with some Chicago capitalists and a few of his old friends in the East, 
soon obtained control of the North Chicago City Railway Company. The 
company was completely reorganized, with Mr. Yerkes as president, and 
cables were adopted as motive power. He also succeeded in using the old 
La Salle Street tunnel, which at that time had been unused for many years, 
thereby overcoming the disadvantage of the swing bridges so long an in- 
convenience to the people of the north side. Two years later he closed nego- 
tiations for a controHing interest in the Chicago West Division Railway 
Company, which was reorganized and improved, Mr. Yerkes becoming presi- 
dent. In both undertakings the confidence of his associates was such that they 
left him to act entirely as his judgment should dictate. Mr. Yerkes became a 
factor in the Chicago elevated railroad systems, as leader in the reorganiza- 
tion of the Lake Street Company, whose managers had appealed to him for 
assistance in their financial straits. Later he undertook to build an elevated 
railroad on the north side of the city, and in 1897 formed the Union Loop 
Company, to provide terminal facilities for all the roads in the heart of the 
city. This project was carried to a successful issue after a long and stubborn 
contention with the property owners. One result of extending the various 
lines outside the city limits was an increased demand for land in the suburban 
districts, and, in order to facilitate the growth of the enterprise, Mr. Yerkes 
conceived a plan of a system of suburban roads, connected with the main 
surface lines and extending to the heart of the city. Accordingly eight dif- 
ferent companies were chartered, and about two hundred and fifty miles of 
track laid. All these corporations were finally united into the Chicago Con- 
solidated Traction Company, whose lines literally gridiron the western and 
northwestern parts of the city.

CHRONICLE OF THE 



In 1899 he parted with his interests in the North Chicago and West 
Chicago Street Railway companies to a syndicate formed of a ntmiber of 
capitalists, and in 1900 he sold the balance of his Chicago railroad holdings 
to another syndicate. He then made London his basis of operation, with the 
intention of giving to London railroad facilities of a modem character, and 
completely revolutionizing the then prevailing methods. It is expected that 
during the present year (1904) some of his railroads will be in operation. It 
is a strange fact that prior to Mr. Yerkes taking an interest in London, that 
great city, the largest in the world, was the least provided with intramural 
transportation of any large city. 

Mr. Yerkes was among the first to become interested in the Coltmibian 
Exposition, was foremost in the struggle for its location in Chicago, and from 
the start was generous in contributing to its support. He was made a mem- 
ber of the board of directors, which position he held throughout the entire 
fair period. In this responsible capacity, his force of character and wisdom 
of counsel made themselves most evident During a trip to Europe he ac- 
complished much in the way of attracting the attention of the would-be 
exhibitors, and in inspiring confidence among foreign nations. As a member 
of the committee on fine arts, his labors were particularly effective, and to his 
influence was largely due the elaborateness and great success of the exhibit 
in that department. He inaugurated a thorough search in the art centres 
of the world for their best and rarest examples, while from his own private 
gallery, one of the finest in the United States, the loan was both valuable and 
extensive. 

In 1897 he presented to the University of Chicago the largest telescope 
in the most perfectly equipped observatory in the world. In 1893 he pur- 
chased a lot on Fifth Avenue, at the comer of Sixty-eighth Street, New York, 
and built for himself a house, which he occupied in January, 1896, and in 
which he still resides. 

Mr. Yerkes is a keen observer and a quick thinker, and his large business 
achievements themselves evidence his untiring energy and indomitable will, 
as well as his clear foresight and sagacity. In the social world he is most 
genial, cordial, and gracious. He is a devoted lover of the beautiful, and in 
his pictures, of which he possesses a large and rich collection, and in his con- 
servatory, which is one of the most unique in America, he finds his especial 
delight. 

He married (i), 22 December, 1859, Susanna Guttridge Gamble, daugh- 
ter of George Newton Gamble, a native of Leicestershire, England, by his 
wife Susanna Guttridge. He married (2), 23 September, 1881, Mary Adelaide 
Moore, daughter of Thomas Moore, Esq., of Philadelphia.

NOTES ON THE LEECH FAMILY 



^ 



S 



\ 







OBY or TOBIAS LEECH, the first of 
the surname Leech to come to Pennsyl- 
vania, was a son of Toby Leech, of Chel- 
tenham, Gloucestershire, England, and 
was baptized in the Parish Church there, 
I January, 1652. The Clerk of the 
Parish has made a tracing of the bap- 
tismal record, a facsimile of which appears on the next 
page. 

The Leech family in England is an ancient one, and 
many of its branches bore for arms: Ermine, on chief in- 
dented gules, three crowns or. Crest, — Out of a ducal 
coronet, on an arm erect ppr., grasping a snake, environed 
around the arm, vert. Burke in his ''Encyclopaedia of 
Heraldry," in mentioning these arms, notes that it is re- 
corded in an old pedigree that " One of this auncient family 
living in Barkshire, near Windsor, in ye time of King Edward 
the Third, entertained and feasted three Kings in his house, 
one ye King of England, ye King of France, and ye King 
of Scots, which two kings were at that time prisoners to 
King Edward, which, King Edward, to requite his good 
entertainment and other favours, gave him three crowns on

his chief indented gu. ye field ermme; which coat is borne by the name and 
family, dispersed into many other countays." 

But little is known of the life of Toby Leech in England. He seems to 
have been brought up in the tanning business, and was probably engaged 
in that occupation before his emigration to America. He came to Pennsyl- 
vania in 1682, bringing with him a wife and child, and being accompanied 
by his mother-in-law, Mrs. Mary Ashmead, and her family. Tradition has 
placed him among those who came with William Penn, in the " Welcome,'* 
but the list of passengers who came in that ship has not been preserved, so 
the claim that he was of the ntmtiber cannot be verified. If not one of them.

his arrival in Pennsylvania must have been close to that of Penn, as he is 
known to have been there within three weeks after Penn arrived, and to 
have purchased of the latter a large plantation, located in what became Chel- 
tenham Township, Philadelphia County,* now a part of Montgomery County. 
He settled upon this plantation, while the Ashmeads established themselves 
upon an adjoining tract, the locality of their homes receiving the name Chel- 
tenham, in honor of the English home of the Leeches and Ashmeads. 

Toby Leech was one of the substantial men among the early colonists, 
and a man of much worth, and he came to be one of the largest landed proprie- 
tors in the Province. Upon his home plantation he erected a com and 
fulling mill, — ^the first to be established in that part of the Province, — and 
also built a tannery, and he conducted the milling and tanning businesses, 
in connection with large agricultural operations, for many years. 

His mansion house, with its contents, was destroyed by fire in 1700, 
and upon its site he erected the house which is still standing, and which is one 
of the oldest houses in Pennsylvania. The fact of the destruction of his 
first home, together with his title-deeds and family papers, is established 
by the minutes of the Commissioners of Property, which contain this entry 
under date of the 4th of the 12th month (February), 1701 : 

"Toby Leech, Rich'd Wall, Jno. Ashmead and Everard Bolton purchas'd in this 
Province 1,000 Acres together by the Prop'ry of which the said Toby's share was 500 Acres 
for which he has now nothing to Shew but the G&gt;py of a Return out of the office for

the said Quantity, in which return he is termed renter, by some Mistake, for he had a 
Pat't for the said 300 Acres at the G&gt;mmon Rent of purchased Lands and produced it to 
the Proprietary and the Secretary about 18 Mo'ths ago when he paid his Quitrent for the 
same, he also produces several Witnesses who have seen a Receipt under the Propr's hand 
for the Purchase Money and therefore requests a new Patent (his old one and all his 
writings being burnt the last year with his House) and in order to it a Resurvey. 

"Ordered that a War't be accordingly granted, and upon the Return a Patent, he 
paying for the Overplus if any be found. 

"John Ashmead, Son and Heir of John Ashmead above mentioned. Purchaser with 
Toby Leech of 250 Acres, Producing a Return of Survey from the office dates loth smo., 
'84, for the said 250 Acres Surveyed 30th 9 mo., 1682, by Vertue of the Propr's War't 
dates loth gmo., '82, but has nothing More to Shew for it, his Papers having been likewise 
burnt, Requests a Resurvey in order to a Patent.'

For thirty years Mr. Leech devoted his attention to his business affairs, 
which were continuously prosperous, without manifesting during that time 
any marked interest in public affairs. In 171 3, however, he became a can- 
didate for membership in the Provincial Assembly, and was elected to that 
position from the county of Philadelphia, taking his seat in the Assembly, 
which met in Philadelphia, 10 October, that year, and becoming one of the 
prominent members of that body. He was re-elected in 1714 and 171 5, and 
again chosen in 1717 and 1719. 

Mr. Leech added extensively to his first purchase of land, and he pos- 
sessed at his death a large estate. His will disposed of two thousand seven 
hundred acres of land, six hundred of which composed his home plantation* 
Besides two other plantations of five hundred acres each in Philadelphia 
County, he owned one of five hundred acres in Chester County, Pennsylvania, 
and one of six hundred acres in New Castle County, Delaware. He is said 
to have kept up the hospitality and style of an English country gentleman. 
" His hunting grounds were famous, and continued to be kept up by his son 
and grandson for many years, and this gave the name to the village of Fox 
Chase." * He was one of the largest slave-owners of his time in Pennsyl- 
vania, and eight of his slaves are mentioned by name in his will. He also 
had, no doubt, many indentured servants, at one of whom a glance is obtained 
in the following advertisement in the Weekly Mercury of July 13, 1721. 

" Philadklphia, July 13, 1721. 
"Run away from Tobias Leech of Philadelphia G&gt;unty, a Servant Man named 
William Williams, about Thirty years old, strong and well set, short black hair, having 
on a Kersey Wastcoat, Linnen Breeches, and Wollen blade and white Stockings. Whoever 
takes up the said Servant, secures him, and gives notice, so that his liiaster may have 
him again, shall have Forty shillings Reward, besides reasonable Charges.

NOTES ON THE 



Although Mr. Leech was baptized in the Church of England, he would 
seem to have departed for a time from its faith, as he married into a Quaker 
family, and the marriage took place at Friends' Meeting. Such departure, 
however, is believed to have continued but for a brief period, as he did not 
attach himself to the Society of Friends in Pennsylvania, but joined there, 
with others, in establishing Trinity (Episcopal) Church, Oxford, Philaddphia, 
with which some of his family for several generations were identified. 

Mr. Leech died at his seat, in Cheltenham, 13 November, 1726, and was 
buried in the ground of Trinity Church, within a few yards of the church 
building. His grave is marked by an ancient stone, as shown in the accom- 
panying illustration. His last will and testament is one of the lengthiest 
recorded in Pennsylvania up to his death, and here follows :

Toby Leech married at Gloucester Monthly Meeting,* in England, 26 
10 mcmth, December, 1679, Esther f Ashmead, daughter of [John?] and 
Mary Ashmead, of Cheltenham, England. She survived her husband but a 
short time, and died at his seat, 11 August, 1726, and was buried by his 
side. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Ashmead, died in 1690, when letters of 
administration on her estate were granted at Philadelphia, unto ''Tobias'' 
Leech, who, the record states, was the husband of her daughter Esther. 
From the tombstone of their son, Jacob Leech, it appears that they had eight 
children. The inscription on the son's stone styles him " of eight bom last 
save one." Only six children are named in the father's will, so it is assumed 
that two died young. Toby, Jun^, was born in England, and it is possible 
that his sister Esther was also bom there, but the others were no doubt bom 
in Pennsylvania.

upon the governor, as was its usual custom on such occasions, and presented 
the newly elected Speaker. The governor announced that he "very much 
approved the action of the House." 

In 1749 Mr. Leech became a member of the first Board of Trustees of 
the Collie of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania, remaining 
a member until his death. In 1751 he was appointed by the Assembly one 
of the commissioners to examine the Schuylkill River, ascertain a place 
for bridging it, and estimate the cost of such project, and in 1757, 1758, 
and 1759 he was Treasurer of the County of Philadelphia. He was a mem- 
ber of the committee which procured the now famous " Independence Bell," 
and was one of the trustees in whom the title to the State-House and other 
public buildings was vested by Act of Assembly passed 17 February, 1762, 
within six wedcs of his death. 

Mr. Leech was a devout Episcopalian, and a prominent member of Christ 
Church, serving as a Vestryman thirty-two years, and Church Warden five 
years. In 1727 he was a member of the committee to supervise the building 
of the church edifice, and in 1751 he was appointed to a similar capacity in 
supervising the work of constructing the steeple. Shortly before his death 
he took an active part in founding St. Paul's Church, under the aisle of 
which he was buried. His death is thus noted in the Pennsylvania Gazette 
of 8 April, 1762: 



"On the 31st ult, in the evening, departed this Life Thomas Leech, Esq., in the 
77th year of his Age, and in the afternoon of the Sunday following was interred in St 
Paul's Church, in this City, where a sermon, suitable to the occasion, was preached by the 
Reverend Mr. William McQenachan, A.M., and Minister of that Church, to a crowded and 
weeping congregation. He was a citizen, not more distinguished for the Honour conferred 
on him, in several offices of public trust (which he discharged for a long series of years, 
with the approbation of his country), than for his amiable and familiar virtues in the mild 
majesty of private life, where he shone as a practical Philosopher, and a sincere christian, 
abounding with unaffected goodness and exemplary piety, and a most rare pattern of that 
ancient simplicity which so beautifully characterized the first Fathers of our Metropolis, so 
that the words of the Poet may with the greatest propriety, be applied to him : 

" ' Bom to no Pride, inheriting no strife. 
But led by virtue thro' the Paths of life ; 
Stranger to Discord and to Civil Rage, 
The good man walk'd innoxious thro' his Age. 
No Courts he saw, no suits would ever try. 
Nor dar'd an Oath, nor hazarded a Lye. 
Well tho' he knew the schoolman's subtle art, 
Yet more he loved the language of the heart. 
By nature honest, by experience wise, 
Healthy by temp'rance, and by exercise. 
His life tho' long, to sickness past unknown. 
His death was patient, and without a groan.' "

ISAAC LEECH, Esq**, fourth son of Toby Leech* by his wife Esther 
Ashmead, was bom at Cheltenham Township, in 1692; died there, 10 
December, 1744, and was buried in the grounds of Trinity Church, Oxford, 
where the stone marking his grave is still standing, and with which church 
his family was identified. He was a wealthy farmer and tanner, and pos- 
sessed a large landed estate. Under the will of his father he received the 
mansion house of the latter, together with three hundred and sixty-six acres 
of the home plantation, and a one-fourth interest in all of the other planta- 
tions which the father owned at his death. His father also bequeathed unto 
him two of his slaves, Cuggo and Cate. He also acquired by purchase 
other large and valuable landed interests. As early as 1727 he had attained 
to sudi standing among his fellow-citizens that in that year he was one 
of the two chosen High Sheriff of Philadelphia County. It was the custom 
during the colonial period to choose at the annual election two persons as 
sheriff, and to return the names of both to the governor, who selected and 
commissioned one of them. On the occasion named, the governor's choice 
fell to Owen Owen, Esq"", the other name returned. Owen had held the 
office the previous year. At his death Mr. Leech was serving as one of the 
justices of the peace and of the courts of Philadelphia County, having been 
commissioned to that position, 10 April, 1741, by Governor Thomas. 

Upon the filling of the inventory of his personal estate, the same was

the rooms is described as the " Blue Room," and another as the " White

China and Delph Ware" are mentioned. Another item named is a "silver 
tankard," which, if preserved, will probably be found to have engraved upon 
it the armorial bearings of the family. 

Mr. Leech married Rebecca Hall, daughter of Joseph Hall by his wife 
Rebecca Rutter, and granddaughter of Jacob Hall, Esq*".* Her sister, 
Susanna Hall, married John Rush, and became the mother of the eminent 
Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; and another 
sister, Sarah Hall, was the wife of Reverend Samuel Finley, President of 
Princeton College, 1 761-1766, and the great-grandmother of Dr. Samuel 
Finley Breese Morse, the inventor of the electro-magnetic telegraph. 

Upon the death of Mr. Leech, his widow married, as second wife, 
Reverend Richard Treat, D.D., Minister of the Abington Presbyterian 
Church. She died at the seat of her son-in-law, Samuel Erwin, Esq"", i July, 
1785, in her seventy-sixth year. The Pennsylvania Gazette of 20 July, that 
year, thus notes her death : 

** On the first instant, died, at the house of Mr. Samuel Erwin, in the Manor of More- 
land, Mrs. RsBECCA Tbeat, widow of Rev. Dr. Treat, late of Abington. She was a woman 
of strong and decisive mind, and remarkable for a quick and penetrating discernment She 
was engaged in the early part of her life in active and busy scenes, and was distinguished for 
the firmness and prudence of her conduct. But this is her lowest praise. She was a good 
woman and pious christian, exemplary in the discharge of all the private and relative duties, 
beloved by her friends, and respected by all who knew her. She bore her last illness with 
christian resignation, and when exhausting nature after a few struggles gave up the contest, 
she calmly sank away and expired in the 76^ year of her age. She was interred in the 
grave where the venerable remains of her former husband were deposited, and a funeral 
sermon well adapted to the occasion was preached by the Rev. Mr. Tenant i G&gt;r. 15-54-" 

Mr. Treat was graduated at Yale College in 1725, and in 1731 was 
ordained pastor of the Abington Presbyterian Church, and remained such 
until his death, in 1777. His will refers to his wife Rebecca, as "widow 
of Isaac Leech." The latter's will, dated 14 October, 1744; proved 7

the Governor and Council, by Captain Sibbald, in the following certificate : 

"I, John Sibbald, do hereby certify that Thomas Leech, Juil, was my Second Lsm- 
tenant on board the Pennsylvania Frigate, during her cruizes. That he behaved hiaitelf

LEECH FAMILY 



CAPTAIN SAMUEL LEECIP, third son of Isaac Leech* by his wife 
Rebecca Hall, was born in Cheltenham Township, 6 January, 1736; died 
there, 2^ May, 1822. He married, 18 February, 1768, Anne Stewart, who 
is named in her husband's will, dated 12 June, 181 7. He was a farmer, and 
a prominent citizen of Cheltenham Township, where he resided on an estate 
which was devised to him by his father. He was a member of the Committee 
of Correspondence for Philadelphia County in 1775, and was in service in 
the Revolution as captain of a company in the Third Regiment, Philadelphia 
County Militia, commanded by Colonel Benjamin McVaugh. His death is 
thus mentioned in the Advertiser of 29 May, 1822 : 

" Departed this life, on the morning of the 27th inst, Mr. Samuel Leech, of Chelten- 
ham, Township, Montgomery G&gt;unty, in the 87th year of his age. The deceased was a 
man much esteemed by all who knew him, and his remains were followed to the grave \tf 
a numerous and respectable concourse of his fellow citizens." 

Captain Leech was the first of his family in Pennsylvania to depart from 
the faith of the Episcopal Church. He became a member of the Abington 
Presbyterian Church, where his children were baptized, and in the graveyard 
of which he and his wife are buried. His change of religious faith was

remained at York for some weeks, and although his company marched to 
Baltimore, it was never called into action. At the expiration of his service 
as Surveyor-General, he removed to Pittsburg, where he engaged in mercantile 
pursuits, but returned to the State capital in 1821. In 1825 he was chosen 
an elder in the First Presbyterian Church at Harrisburg, and continued sucli 
until 1837, when he again removed to Pittsburg. He was a man of fine abili- 
ties, of very firm, decided character. In political connections he was identified 
with what was then known as the Federal party, and gave it strong support 
In his official relations he was greatly esteemed. " The course of public events 
was ever watched by him with deep and zealous interest ; and every violation 
of true principle in the conduct of national events caused him pain as if an 
injury had been done to a dear friend. He was a thorough Christian 
patriot." * He married Miss Steinman, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

NOTES ON THE RUTTER FAMILY 





HOMAS RUTTER, Esq"', a native of 
England, where the name R utter had 
been an honorable one for many genera- 
tions, was one of the early Pennsylvania 
colonists. He was a man of marked in- 
telligence and energy ; was prominent 
among the enterprising and pubUc spirited 
men of his time, and rendered valuable service in the upbuild- 
ing of the material interests of Pennsylvania. He had ac- 
quired in his native country the useful art of blacksmithing, 
and it is possible that he came to Pennsylvania in the employ 
of William Penn, to engage for him as a worker in iron, the 
suggestion of which possibility is found in the facts that he 
was married at Penn's Manor House, and received from 
Penn a grant of two hundred acres of land as compensation 
for " smith's service." 

William Penn had great faith in the mineral wealth of 
his Province, and early entertained the hope that he would 
gain large advantages therefrom, and from the outstart he 
sought to stimulate the colonists to develop this wealth. 
Thomas Rutter was one of the first to respond to such 
stimulation, and he made his interest in the subject mani- 



NOTES ON THE 



fest, as was natural in view of his technical knowledge of iron, in the direction 
of mining for iron ore. He began prospecting for ore, and, at the same time, 
enlisted others to join with him in such enterprise. 

Under date of January, 1702, the land records of the G)mmissioners of 
Property make mention of seven hundred and sixty-two acres of land as then 
in the possession of " Thomas Rutter's and Company," and James Logan, 
Penn's secretary, in a letter to Penn in the same year, writes : " I have 
spoken to the chief of those concerned in the iron mines, but they seem care- 
less, never had a meeting since thy departure. Their answer is that they 
have not yet fotmd any considerable vein." " Those concerned" were, no 
doubt, the members of the company styled " Thomas nutter's and Company" 
by the Commissioners of Property. 

Rutter was not discouraged by his early unsuccessful mining efforts, but 
continued prospecting until he found ore in paying quantities. This point 
reached, he built a smelting-fumace, and began the manufacture of iron, thus 
securing for himself the high honor of being the first in Pennsylvania to 
manufacture iron from ore. His achievement is thus mentioned in a letter 
written in 1717 by Jonathan Dickinson: "The last summer, one Thomas 
Rutter, a smith, who lived not far from Germantown, hath removed farther 
up the country, and of his own strength has set up making iron. Such it 
proves to be, as it is highly esteemed by all the smith's here, who say that 
the best Sweed's iron doth not exceed it." 

The section of territory to which Rutter removed was known as the 
" Manatawny," deriving its name from the Manatawny Creek, which flowed 
through that part of the country. It then formed a part of Philadelphia 
County, but fell in Berks when that coimty was organized. The reason 
which prompted the removal was no doubt a desire on his part to be in close 
touch with his iron operations, which were located near by the Iron Stone Creek, 
an important branch of the Manatawny. His furnace was on the former 
stream. A few years after he erected the furnace he leased the same to a 
company of capitalists, who operated it many years, under the name of the 
Colebrookdale Furnace. He also built a forge, known as Pool Forge, and 
organized a company to conduct it, Rutter himself owning interests in the 
company. In the will of his son John the forge is called " Rutter's Forge." 

Mr. Rutter's iron enterprises were recognized by the public authorities as 
a valuable factor in conserving the material welfare of the Province, which 
recognition was clearly manifested in 1723, when a public road was opened, 
leading from his mines to the " great road" which led from that region to 
Philadelphia.*

RUTTER FAMILY 



In the tax-list of Philadelphia G)unty, in 1693, Mr. Rutter is assessed 
in both Bristol and Germantown townships. At this time he was probably 
residing on his plantation in Bristol Township, but later removed to within 
the corporate limits of the borough of Germantown, where, in 1706, he wa3 
chosen bailiff, — ^the chief executive officer of the borough, — in which capacity 
he presided, 1 1 January, 1 707, at the last sitting of the Court of Record held 
under the borough charter.* 

In 171 3, 1714, 1727, and 1728 Mr. Rutter was chosen a member of 
the Provincial Assembly, and during the latter year he participated in a 
noted Conference, held in the " Great Meeting House" at Philadelphia by 
a number of Indian chiefs with the governor of the Province and his Council. 
Rutter was well known to and highly esteemed by the Indians, and when 
the famous Delaware chief, Sassoman, came to make his address, he recog- 
nized the presence of Rutter, and asked the latter to take a seat beside 

him.t 

Thomas Rutter's early religious affiliations were with the Society of 
Friends. He was a member of the Philadelphia Meeting at the time of his 
marriage, but soon after attached himself to Abington Meeting, on the records 
of which the births of his three eldest children are entered. He later became 
a Baptist, his change of faith occurring during the schism which arose, in 
1 69 1, among the Friends. He took a prominent part in that movement as 
one of the followers of the noted George Keith, and was baptized after the 
order of the Baptists. He had been a Minister among the Friends, but now 
became one among the Baptists, and for a time he was the Pastor of the small 
congregation of that sect in Philadelphia. He baptized a number of persons 
who, later, were prominent in the Baptist denomination. Among such was 
the Reverend Evan Morgan, the third pastor of the Pennepek Baptist Church. 
One of the incidents of the movement to which allusion has been made was 
the writing of a pamphlet by Francis Daniel Pastorius, published in 1697, 
and entitled " Henry Bernard Koster, William Davis, Thomas Rutter, and 
Thomas Bowyer, four Boasting disputers of this World, Rebuked and 
answered according to their Folly, which they themselves have manifested in 
a late pamphlet, entitled Advice for all Professors and Writers." 

Thomas Rutter died at Philadelphia, in March, 1730, and his death is 
thus mentioned in the Pennsylvania Gazette of that month : 



" March 15— On Sunday night last died here, Thomas Rutth, S^ after a short ilkiess. 
He was the first that erected an Iron Work in Pennsylvania.**

* Jacob Hall, Esq', emigrated to Pennsylvania, from Macclesfield, Chester County, England, 
in 1684, having, about the time of his emigration, purchased of William Penn a tract of five hundred 
acres in his Province. He was, no doubt, a passenger on the ship ** Friendship.'' John Worthington, 
who sailed in the same ship, died on the voyage, 17 January, x684t having, on the previous day, made 
his will, naming Jacob Hall one of the executors.* Hall administered, and is styled in the probate 
record, "of Bucks County," where he is assumed to have settled immediately after his arrival. 
In a deed of 6 January, 1691-92,1 he is styled "of Bucks County, but formerly of Macclesfield, co. 
Chester, Old England," and he doubtless removed about that time to Philadelphia County, as in a 
power of attorney made two months later,} he is styled of that county. He established his residence 
at Tacony, in the latter county, and continued there until his death in xToa On 6 May, 1693, he was 
commissioned by Governor Fletcher a justice of the peace and of the courts of Philadelphia County. 
Among the others commissioned at the same time were Anthony Morris and Francis Rawle, founders 
of the well-known Philadelphia families bearing their respective surnames. His will, dated 99 Sep-

sons Jacob, Joseph, and Solomon ; daughter Sarah Taylor, and Sarah Charlesworth, " aunt of my 
children." It is believed that the maiden name of his wife was Charlesworth, and that she was a sister 
of Sarah Charlesworth. The latter married Henry Mallows, of Oxford Township, and, as his widow, 
died there in 1723, disposing by will of almost her entire estate to either the children or grandchildren 
of Jacob Hall, naming them individually as " cousins." She also bequeathed a sum of money for the 
purchase " of a settlement for a minister of Oxford Church." 

Jacob Hall, the eldest son of Jacob Hall, Esq', was bom 8 February, 1679. He died in Oxford 
Township, in 17x2, leaving, to survive him, a widow, Ellen, and children Jacob, Mary, and Elisabeth.
