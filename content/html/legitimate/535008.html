       <p id="block-1"><strong>This afternoon we get to find out how old fashioned hustle and bustle fares against samba artistry. </strong> Just how will Ramires and Lucas Leiva cope with Charlie Adam? Got you! <br><strong><br>This match won't be played in Rio and nor will it be played in Edinburgh.</strong> No, instead Brazil and Scotland are hot-footing it to the Emirates Stadium. Apparently Brazil's fans aren't too happy about their side jetting about all over Europe playing friendlies, although speaking as someone who's sat through far too many England friendlies, the further away these games are, the better. In any case, what better venue than Arsenal's ground than the purveyors of <em>Joga Bonito</em>, whatever the hell that is, and the owners of the aforementioned Charlie Adam? That said, Craig Levein has been known to take a leaf out of Fun Bobby's book and play a revolutionary 4-6-0 formation.</p>
       <p>There are some nifty footballers playing for Scotland though. Aside from Adam, James McCarthur - not to be confused with his Wigan team-mate James McCarthy - and James Morrison are two smooth midfielders. Kenny Miller once scored a really important goal against Manchester United. Alan Hutton is the Scottish Dani Alves. Gary Caldwell is always amusing to watch. Christophe Berra has an exotic name. For Brazil, there's no obvious stand-out player. The old fantasy isn't quite there; there's no Ronaldinho, no Kaka, no Ronaldo, no Adriano, no Robinho, not that this lot are exactly a bunch of chancers. David Luiz and Maicon are only on the bench after all. The one to watch out for today is Neymar, the prodigiously talented Santos youngster, Neymar, who West Ham <del>pretended they wanted</del> tried to sign in the summer. </p>
       <p><strong>Weather update:</strong> It's sunny and hot in north London, as if Brazil needed any more of an advantage. </p>
       <p><strong>Brazil (4-4-2):</strong> Julio Cesar; Alves, Lucio, Thiago Silva, Andre Santos; Jadson, Lucas, Ramires, Elano; Damiao, Neymar. <strong>Subs:</strong> Victor, Jefferson, Maicon, Luisao, David Luiz. Sandro, Henrique, Elias, Renato Augusto, Lucas, Jonas.</p>
       <p><strong>Scotland (4-5-1):</strong> McGregor; Hutton, Caldwell, Berra, Crainey; Morrison, Adam, Brown, McArthur, Whittaker; Miller. </p>
       <p><strong>Referee:</strong> England's Howard Webb.</p>

       <p id="block-8"><strong>Can we have the Brazilian national anthem?</strong> It's lovely.</p>
       <!-- Block 9 -->
       <p id="block-9"><strong>1 min:</strong> We're off! Scotland kick off from right to left and immediately hoof the ball out of play on the right, playing for territory. They've got Brazil running scared already. They keep the pressure on, and just outside the area, Miller backs into Lucio, who nudges him over. This is a great position for Adam.</p>
       <!-- Block 10 -->
       <p id="block-10"><strong>2 min:</strong> The free-kick is 25 yards out, just to the right, a perfect position for Adam, who's scored from here with that marvellous left foot of his. This, though, is not so perfect, wafted straight into the wall, and Brazil clear.</p>
       <!-- Block 11 -->
       <p id="block-11"><strong>3 min:</strong> Scotland fans boo as Brazil get a feel of the ball. Really? It's only a friendly. Someone should tell Scott Brown and Andre Santos though, who have just a minor disagreement over a throw-in. A throw-in. Maybe it's the sun.</p>
       <!-- Block 12 -->
       <p id="block-12"><strong>5 min:</strong> Adam woefully gives the ball away with a square pass across the face of his own area, straight to Neymar. The 19-year-old darts into the area menacingly, but Hutton ushers him down a blind alley and he's eventually crowded out. Brazil win it back quickly though, and Neymar tees up Lucas for a shot from 25 yards out, but it's hit with all the confidence of a man with 0.2 career goals.</p>
       <!-- Block 13 -->
       <p id="block-13"><strong>6 min:</strong> I'm watching this on an internet feed. It's grainy.</p>
       <!-- Block 14 -->
       <p id="block-14"><strong>7 min:</strong> Scotland's game plan is clear; make room for Adam in the centre, so he can ping the ball about at will. He's just tried two diagonal balls in quick succession, one to the right and one to the left, but neither Andre Santos nor Dani Alves were having anything of it. Clearly, though, Scotland have identified Brazil's full-backs as weak links. Not so sure about that, myself.</p>
       <!-- Block 15 -->
       <p id="block-15"><strong>8 min:</strong> Damiao is played to the byline with a glorious reverse pass by Elano on the left, but it's just overhit, meaning the attacker is on the stretch as he pulls his cross back into the six-yard box. Neymar is waiting, but McGregor plunges on the ball comfortably enough.</p>
       <!-- Block 16 -->
       <p id="block-16"><strong>10 min:</strong> Well, it's pretty even so far, which is another way of saying nothing's happened yet.</p>
       <!-- Block 17 -->
       <p id="block-17"><strong>11 min:</strong> This is a waste. Just for a moment, Scotland's defence appeared to be creaking under the pressure as Jadson found space on the right, but he checked back on to his left foot and then generously looped a dire cross out for a goal-kick, Neymar's efforts to keep it in all in vain. But well done for the youthful zest and energy. He'll soon have that ground out of him.</p>
       <!-- Block 18 -->
       <p id="block-18"><strong>12 min:</strong> Brazil are starting to settle into their groove. Neymar is clearly the biggest threat for them. It looked like he was going nowhere on the left flank, but suddenly produced a marvellous backheel to Andre Santos, whose return pass inside Hutton was judged to perfection. Neymar was away down the inside-left channel, but with Scotland's defence all over the place, his cutback took a nick off a Scottish defender, taking it away from the waiting Brazil forwards. The ball came back to Alves on the edge of the area, but after a clever pirouette, his attempted pass through to Jadson was overhit.</p>
       <!-- Block 19 -->
       <p id="block-19"><strong>15 min:</strong> Elano is allowed too much time on the right to whip a cross to the far post, where Ramires rises above Hutton to head over the bar. "Where o where can Arsenal's Denilson be?" asks Scott Stricker. "Surely his performances warrant a Brazil call-up." Especially on home soil.</p>
       <!-- Block 20 -->
       <p id="block-20"><strong>16 min:</strong> Neymar's a bag o'tricks at times - although he has a ridiculous haircut. It looks like a really bushy mohawk, although it also seems to resemble something from the 80s. More on this soon.</p>
       <!-- Block 21 -->
       <p id="block-21"><strong>18 min:</strong> It feels like a matter of time for Brazil. Jadson suddenly finds himself clear on the right side of the area, and whacks a low shot towards goal. It's straight at McGregor, who makes a meal of the effort, spilling it out into the six-yard box. Thankfully Neymar slips when he might have just prodded the ball home and Scotland hack it clear.</p>
       <!-- Block 22 -->
       <p id="block-22"><strong>20 min:</strong> Another miss from Brazil! Whittaker is caught napping as Alves makes one of his buccaneering charges forward from right-back. Elano spots his run and lofts a delightful ball towards him, and Alves' header into the area is put scrambled behind for a corner. Elano sends it in from the right and Damiao leaps above two - two! - Scottish defenders beautifully to power a header inches over the angle of post and bar. He really should have scored. On target, it was in.</p>
       <!-- Block 23 -->
       <p id="block-23"><strong>23 min:</strong> The game is now being exclusively played in Scotland's half, which isn't a huge surprise. Crainey deflects Elano's cross behind for another corner...</p>
       <!-- Block 24 -->
       <p id="block-24"><strong>24 min:</strong> Scotland defend the corner better this time, the ball headed clear, but the danger's not over. It only comes straight back to Elano, who clips another teasing cross into the six-yard box where, again, Damiao causes havoc, looping a header wide of the left post. Scotland need to deal not only with this threat in the area, but also concentrate on stopping Elano's crosses.</p>
       <!-- Block 25 -->
       <p id="block-25"><strong>25 min:</strong> Another Howard Webb special. On the edge of Scotland's area, Neymar dinks the ball past Hutton, who clumsily whacks him on the knee. That should be a free-kick, but Webb awards nothing, which<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgangZy4Ob0"> isn't much of a surprise</a>. The ball deflects to the left of the area for Ramires but his volley is charged down by Caldwell.</p>
       <!-- Block 26 -->
       <p id="block-26"><strong>27 min:</strong> Again Whittaker switches off on the left, and Brazil take advantage. This is far too easy. Elano stands on the right touchline, no one bothering to put any pressure on him, and he's able to lazily roll a pass behind Whittaker for the onrushing Lucas, no one going with the Liverpool midfielder. Lucas reaches the byline, and slams the ball into the six-yard box, where chaos ensues. With various team-mates to pick out, this was actually a terrible cross from Lucas, but it deflects up off the chest of the diving McGregor and on to the arm of Caldwell in front of his own goal. It's not handball, though, as he knew nothing about it, and he does well to adjust his body and ensure he doesn't divert the ball into his own goal. Instead it loops wide of the right post, where Damiao, trying to rescue the situation, can only touch it out for a goal-kick.</p>
       <!-- Block 27 -->
       <p id="block-27"><strong>28 min:</strong> Now Alves breaks clear into the area, but his shot is charged down by Berra. He looked poised to score there.</p>
       <!-- Block 28 -->
       <p id="block-28"><strong>30 min:</strong> Neymar has been off getting treatment after a clash with Scott Brown, although he's able to continue.</p>
       <!-- Block 29 -->
       <p id="block-29"><strong>33 min:</strong> I can't remember the last time Scotland got into Brazil's half. That said, it's still 0-0, so they probably won't care too much. Probably not for too much longer though.</p>
       <!-- Block 30 -->
       <p id="block-30"><strong>34 min:</strong> Danger as Elano coaxes a super little pass into the path of Neymar, who shapes to shoot on the edge of the area, only to be denied by a wonderful double-challenge from Adam and Caldwell.</p>
       <!-- Block 31 -->
       <p id="block-31"><strong>35 min:</strong> In the context of the match, this is a brilliant chance for Scotland. Just after the tackle on Neymar, Scotland broke forward and Morrison won a free-kick on the left, around 40 yards from goal. Adam curled it into the area and Whittaker used the pace on the ball to glance a header a few yards wide of the right-hand post. Unlucky. If it had been on target, it was one of those skimming headers which would have given the goalkeeper no chance. But it wasn't on target, so you don't care about all that, do you?</p>
       <!-- Block 32 -->
       <p id="block-32"><strong>37 min:</strong> Now Brazil have a free-kick on the left touchline, but Neymar proves he's no Charlie Adam, hitting the first man. "Watched the Argentina – USA friendly yesterday," says Paul Taylor. "Argentina for most of the game passed and played like Spain/Barca—a beautiful side, with Messi to boot. Are they a new/old power in the making?" They really should be. Essentially they just need to be coached properly and lose their ability to choke when it comes to the crunch.</p>
       <!-- Block 33 -->
       <p id="block-33"><strong>39 min:</strong> For all their dominance and possession, Brazil haven't created too many clear-cut chances, which is mainly down to some thunderous tackles from the Scotland defence. On occasion they've been caught out, but hardly embarrassed. There have been dodgy moments, but McGregor hasn't actually had to overly exert himself.</p>
       <!-- Block 34 -->
       <p id="block-34"><strong>40 min:</strong> Brazil <em>joga bonito</em> their way through the middle, Neymar at the heart of the move, twisting, flicking, spinning and generally dazzling the Scottish defence with some astonishing footwork. He also produces the final pass too, scooping the ball through to Damiao, but unfortunately the flag goes up.</p>
       <!-- Block 35 -->
       <p id="block-35"><strong>GOAL! Brazil 1-0 Scotland (Neymar, 42 min):</strong> Well, he's been the undoubted star of this first half and this is an absolutely brilliant goal. This kid is definitely one for the future. Scotland haven't really coped at all well with Brazil's marauding full-backs, and this time Andre Santos was sent haring clear on the left. No one got close to him and he was able to slide the ball into the area for Neymar, around 10 yards from goal. His first touch wasn't great, setting him off balance, and Caldwell appeared to have the situation covered. But then out of nothing, he adjusted himself and, quick as a flash, he suddenly opened up his body and curled a sublime shot around Caldwell, using him as shield to flummox McGregor, and into the bottom right corner. Now that's what they mean when they talk about joga bonito.</p>
       <!-- Block 36 -->
       <p id="block-36"><strong>44 min:</strong> Neymar. He'll be at Real Madrid next season.</p>
       <!-- Block 37 -->
       <p id="block-37"><strong>45 min:</strong> The match is now on ITV, bizarrely.</p>
       <!-- Block 38 -->
       <p id="block-38"><strong>45 min+2:</strong> The best aspect of Neymar's goal was that Caldwell, while essentially a mere spectator, was also unwittingly the most important thing about it.</p>
       <!-- Block 39 -->
       <p id="block-39"><strong>Peep! Peep!</strong> Howard Webb blows for half time. Well that was enjoyable. It's always good to find out what all the fuss was about.</p>
       <!-- Block 40 -->
       <p id="block-40"><strong>More on Travis. </strong> "Never mind Travis just inspiring musicians, yesterday, on the Glasgow Underground, I saw a Wedding Venue being advertised by an inspiring quote-cum-review from Fran "the Main Travis Guy" Healy!" says Ryan Dunne. "How the mighty are fallen. Or not so much. I also think Ronaldo should have tried another season, in the Scottish Fitba League. Kris Boyd, plump and beery, never bothered to run around and he still scored oodles up here." <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KLrwmUDg0">It would be like George Best and Rodney Marsh playing for Fulham.</a></p>
       <!-- Block 41 -->
       <p id="block-41"><strong>Hair update:</strong> Actually, Neymar's hair is a bit like <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBK0i83ip78">Pumba's in the Lion King</a>. So a cross between a punk and a warthog. Good job he's so good at football.</p>
       <!-- Block 42 -->
       <p id="block-42"><strong>46 min:</strong> Happily neither side have made any changes. Brazil get us going again, and Neymar starts where he left off, hitting the bar with a <em>magnificent</em> shot! Once again Adam gave the ball away in his own half, allowing Neymar to run at a retreating Scotland defence and crack the ball over McGregor from 25 yards out, the ball whistling past the goalkeeper and clipping the top of the bar. This kid has got it.</p>
       <!-- Block 43 -->
       <p id="block-43"><strong>47 min:</strong> What on earth is McGregor thinking of here? In possession of the ball, instead of kicking it clear, he rolls the ball to the edge of the area to McArthur, facing his own goal. He's immediately smothered by two Brazilian midfielders, Ramires robbing him and advancing forward, clear on goal. This really should be 2-0 but amazingly Ramires also makes the wrong choice, trying to set up Neymar for a tap-in. He gets the pass all wrong, allowing McGregor to redeem himself, diving at the youngster's feet and scooping the ball away, before charging down Elano's follow-up.</p>
       <!-- Block 44 -->
       <p id="block-44"><strong>50 min:</strong> Alves squeezes a pass into the area for Ramires, but he's closed down well by Berra. As with the first half, even when they get the ball, Scotland are struggling to make it out of their own half. This has been a chastening experience for them.</p>
       <!-- Block 45 -->
       <p id="block-45"><strong>51 min:</strong> For a moment, Miller finds himself with time and space on the edge of Brazil's area, after Whittaker had tackled Alves, but Webb blows for a foul to Brazil, despite the Scottish midfielder getting the ball. Oh Howard.</p>
       <!-- Block 46 -->
       <p id="block-46"><strong>53 min:</strong> Dear me. What a superb miss from Ramires. Once again, Brazil poured forward on the counter, the ball worked to Jadson, in space on the right side of the area. He had around 73 team-mates to pick out in the area, and decided to roll it across to Ramires. No more than eight yards out, he totally lost his head, leant back and blazed the ball miles over the bar. I've just seen it whizz past our office in Kings Cross.</p>
       <!-- Block 47 -->
       <p id="block-47"><strong>55 min:</strong> That Ramires shot wouldn't have looked out of place <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3_NABDDen0">in this video.</a></p>
       <!-- Block 48 -->
       <p id="block-48"><strong>57 min:</strong> Scotland make their first change, Barry Bannan, currently on loan at Leeds, coming on for James McArthur.</p>
       <!-- Block 49 -->
       <p id="block-49"><strong>58 min:</strong> Adam concedes a foul around 40 yards from goal in a central position. Elano is standing over it. Surely not? He does have form from <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ3eCh7wft8">this range</a>, mind you. No. He does shoot, but it's a fairly tame effort, making its way through the wall but bouncing straight into the arms of McGregor.</p>
       <!-- Block 50 -->
       <p id="block-50"><strong>60 min:</strong> Another Elano corner from the right, another Leandro Damiao header wide. Once again the marking was non-existent, once again the leap was prodigious, once again the header was off target, once again he should have scored.</p>
       <!-- Block 51 -->
       <p id="block-51"><strong>61 min:</strong> This is a worrying sight for Blackpool fans - Charlie Adam has gone down clutching his knee after tackling Elano. He looks to be in some pain.</p>
       <!-- Block 52 -->
       <p id="block-52"><strong>62 min:</strong> Well, he's had some treatment and he's up again and waiting to come back on, although Craig Levein should probably think about taking him off.</p>
       <!-- Block 53 -->
       <p id="block-53"><strong>63 min:</strong> And straight away, Adam is back in the action. He finds a bit of space and looks to float a ball over the top for Miller. His pass is blocked but deflects into the path of Morrison, who chests the ball forward, forcing Ramires to come across and shank the ball out for a corner. And Adam hits the first man. What a waste.</p>

Really, Peter? Really? This is a decent little spell for Scotland though, not allowing Brazil to settle at all. Adam has a pop from 30 yards out but it flies well over the top.</p>
       <!-- Block 56 -->
       <p id="block-56"><strong>67 min:</strong> More pressure on Lucio forces him to concede another corner on the left, much to the delight of the Scotland fans, who haven't had much to cheer about today. Adam's corner is headed clear by Thiago Silva though. Drury doesn't decide to call this fairly mundane occurrence a "lovely moment" though. I wonder why.</p>

       <p id="block-60"><strong>73 min:</strong> For a moment, it looked like Miller was about to reach a long ball over the top, but the ball agonisingly skipped off the surface and span through to Julio Cesar, which, I believe, is the first time I've mentioned him today.</p>

       <p id="block-68"><strong>84 min:</strong> "Don't touch him," parps Peter Drury, as Neymar skips into the area, somehow managing to imply the kid dived for the penalty.</p>
       <!-- Block 69 -->
       <p id="block-69"><strong>85 min:</strong> The first glimpse of the new youngster, Lucas, who goes on a lovely run past a host of tired Scottish challenges. He moves it to the right for Alves, who touches it back to Lucas, whose clipped shot is deflected by Crainey, taking the sting out of the shot. Brazil cry for handball, but Webb is having none of it.</p>
       <!-- Block 70 -->
       <p id="block-70"><strong>86 min:</strong> Alves stands up a cross from the right, and Elias sends a header narrowly over the bar. That's the cue for Levein to send on Craig Mackail-Smith for Kenny Miller. This is Mackail-Smith's international debut, much to the wonderment of the ever-innocent Peter Drury. Sandro is also on for Brazil, in place of Lucas Leiva.</p>
       <!-- Block 71 -->
       <p id="block-71"><strong>89 min:</strong> Scotland win a free-kick 25 yards out, a late chance for a consolation. Bannan's effort is decent, but straight at Cesar, who makes his first save of the afternoon. "Hair-wise, are we sure Neymar hasn't been inspired by Travis?" asks Mark Gillies. "Bickle, I mean. Why weren't you watching ITV from the start like the rest of us?" It was on there from the start.</p>
       <!-- Block 72 -->
       <p id="block-72"><strong>90 min:</strong> Neymar, who's achieved the rare feat of making an international friendly vaguely watchable, is replaced by Renato Augusto. A good afternoon's work for the youngster, who will have made a few people sit up and take notice with a sparkling performance.</p>
       <!-- Block 73 -->
       <p id="block-73"><strong>90 min+2:</strong> Neymar's not the only youngster who's caught the eye. Lucas has been very impressive since coming on, inventive and skillful in equal measure. Just here, a delightfully disguised pass set Jonas through on goal, but his finish, lashed over the top from close range, did not do the assist justice. Scotland make a final change, Don Cowie on for James Morrison.</p>
       <!-- Block 74 -->
       <p id="block-74"><strong>Peep! Peep! Peep!</strong> And there it is. Howard Webb brings the match to an end. That wasn't much of a contest, to be perfectly honest. Hopefully Scotland enjoyed their day out. They'll enjoy it even more now that's over, safe in the knowledge they won't have to play Neymar again any time soon. Thanks for reading and thanks for emailing. Bye.</p>
