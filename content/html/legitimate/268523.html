<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Introduction</font></h2>

<p>MIT Yellow Brick Logo (MIT-YBL) is an implementation of the Logo
language for the LEGO RCX Brick.  MIT Yellow Brick Logo includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>An MIT-written replacement for the firmware operating system that
is loaded into the RCX Brick, and

<li>Software that runs on a Macintosh or Windows 95/98 computer to
implement a text-based Logo interface to the RCX Brick.
</ul>

<p>MIT Logo Blocks (MIT-LB) is a graphical version of MIT Yellow Brick
Logo. Presently, MIT-LB is only available for the Macintosh.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">Audience</font></h2>

<p>MIT Yellow Brick Logo and MIT Logo Blocks are intended to be used
by educators in a classroom or workshop format.<p>

<p>It is important that MIT-YBL and MIT-LB be used under the
supervision of those who have a significant background in the use of
the Logo language with children.  Therefore, we have established the
following requirements for the use of MIT-YBL and MIT-LB.  You must
either: 

<ol>
<p><li>Have five (5) years experience using Logo environments with
children.  (Examples of Logo environments include: LEGO tc logo, LEGO
Control Lab, LCSI LogoWriter, and LSCI MicroWorlds.)</p>

<p><li>Or, participate in a week-long intensive workshop in which MIT-YBL
and MIT-LB are used.</p>

</ol>

<p>If you do not fit into either of these categories, but believe you
should be qualified to use MIT-YBL and MIT-LB, please contact us at <a
href=mailto:ybl@media.mit.edu><kbd>ybl@media.mit.edu</kbd></a>.</p>
