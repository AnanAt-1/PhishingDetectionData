<BR>2000 - 2009
</DIV>

<P><BR> From July 2000 through August 2009, DNA Lounge featured a
number of flatscreen internet kiosks scattered around the club.

<P> In the time before everyone had a cell phone, and everyone's cell
phone included a decent web browser, this was very convenient.

<P> In This Modern World of 2009, however, I found that the kiosks
didn't really provide much.  Also, they were a constant maintenance
headache, so in August 2009, we finally retired them, as described in
my <A HREF="//www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/07/05.html">Jul 5</A>,
<A HREF="//www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/08/11.html">Aug 11</A>, and
<A HREF="//www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/08/kiosks.html">Aug 27</A> blog posts.

<P> They were pretty cool, a unique and notable feature for a
night club, and a more-or-less interesting technical challenge.

<P> But the time had come for them to join the dustbin of computing
history.

<P><BR><BR> The rest of this document describes how they used to work.
<BR><BR><BR>

<P>

Our goal for the kiosks was for them to be usable for web browsing,
IRC, AIM, and so on.  (IRC was, in fact, still a going concern at the
time.)  When most people set up kiosks, they tend to try and lock them
down so that you can only run a web browser, but that's a little too
limiting, since I want people to be able to run other applications too
(telnet, ssh, irc, and so on.)  So really, I wanted to give access to
a complete desktop system.  But do so safely and reliably.

<P> I decided to set them up as Linux systems running the 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000901061727/http%3A//www.gnome.org//">GNOME</A> desktop, preconfigured
with all the common applications people might want to run.  However, I
needed to figure out a way to make the system robust enough that one
user couldn't screw it up for another, on purpose or accidentally.  The
system would need to be locked down enough that it was easy to reset it
to a working state.

     HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="'l33t warcha1king g1yph0r">
<P> (Incidentally, though our kiosks themselves are hardwired, we also
provide free wireless network access within the club: 802.11b
<NOBR>SSID = "dnalounge",</NOBR> no registration required.)

<P> So, I had the following goals:

<P><UL>

 <LI> When the machine boots up, it should automatically log itself
   in as ``guest'', and go to the desktop without requiring a login dialog.

 <P></LI><LI> It should be possible to pull the plug on the machine at any
   time without loss of data: at no time should <TT>fsck</TT> need to
   run.

 <P></LI><LI> Logging out or rebooting should reset the machine to a default
   state, clearing out any changes a previous user might have made.

 <P></LI><LI> Small form factor: I wanted flat screens, and I wanted them
   without spending a fortune.

</LI></UL>

<P> Originally I was planning on using cheap laptops to do this: In
early 2000, one could obtain refurbished P90 laptops with 800x600
displays and PCMCIA ethernet for around $450 each.
I got the above goals (booting read-only, logging in, etc) 
<A HREF="laptops/">working with laptops</A>; but it turned out to
be a a bad idea.

<P> I came to the realization that laptop hardware is just too
flaky.  Pretty much everything about a laptop is inferior to a desktop
machine, in terms of performance, reliability, and expense: their only
benefit is that they run off batteries, and that's not a concern in
this application.  They're also hellaciously difficult to service: if
something goes wrong, you throw the whole thing away and get a new
one.

<P> So, we decided to spend a bit more money on the kiosks to get
something more reliable: diskless desktop computers for the kiosks,
plus external flatscreens.  The benefits here are that: the machine
itself can be serviced; and if the machine gets toasted, I don't have
to buy a new screen too.  The screens can be secured such that they
are fairly indestructible, and they also have a warranty.  Plus,
commodity hardware is both cheaper and more reliable than laptop
hardware.

<P> 

Currently, the hardware we're using for the kiosks is:

<P> From late 2000 through 2006, these machines ran as "fat client"
computers: the machines each ran all of their applications locally,
but had no local disks.  Everything was mounted via NFS from a remote
file server.  Users would auto-login as a "guest" user on the client
machine, which would run X11, a web browser, a basic GNOME desktop,
etc.

<P> As much was mounted shared and read-only as possible; and when the
machine rebooted, everything was reset to a default state.

<P> That worked reasonably well for six years, but it was
<A HREF="fatclient/">hellaciously complicated</A>.  We wasted a lot of
time fighting with stupid hardware compatibility problems (e.g., the
kernel not liking the onboard NIC, crap like that) and they often ran
out of RAM and crashed, especially if someone tried to run a Java
applet.

<P> So, these days, they are "thin clients" instead of "fat clients".
The back-room server machine (which had been merely the file server
for the fat clients) is now a much beefier machine which runs all
of the applications for the kiosks. Each kiosk is, essentially, an X
terminal.  All that the kiosks run locally is an X11 server; the
window managers and web browsers are all running on the same remote
host.   That machine has a 1GHz processor and 1.2GB RAM, which
(it turns out) is plenty to run six copies of GNOME and Firefox
under the kind of light usage they get in our environment.

    by following their instructions.  It's pretty straightforward.
    This will install a bunch of stuff in
    <TT>/opt/<WBR>ltsp-4.2/<WBR>i386/</TT> and <TT>/tftpboot/</TT>.

    <P> Make sure the LTSP installer edited <TT>/etc/exports</TT> correctly.

    <P> At this point, when you boot one of the kiosks, it should
    launch X and show you a login prompt.  You should be able to

    <P> You can skip this part.

    <P> But, if there are any other applications you want to run on
    the thin clients themselves, you can do that by creating a custom
    LTSP "screen.d" file.  In my environment, I need to run "gpm" on
    the clients, and for debugging, I also run "sshd".  I created
    this <A HREF="sbin/dnakiosk"><TT>dnakiosk</TT></A> file, which is
    installed in <TT>/opt/<WBR>ltsp-4.2/<WBR>i386/<WBR>etc/<WBR>screen.d/</TT>.
    To use it, edit <TT>/home/<WBR>local/<WBR>ltsp-4.2/<WBR>i386/<WBR>etc/<WBR>lts.conf</TT>
    to include <TT>SCREEN_01=dnakiosk</TT>.

    <P> Here is the <A HREF="sbin/lts.conf"><B>lts.conf</B></A>
    that we use.  Note that it runs different X servers for different
    kiosks (depending on what graphics chipsets they have) and that
    it uses gpm.

    <P><UL TYPE=DISC>

    <LI> To get the "gpm" executable to be accessible from the
    remote machines, simply copy it into the directory that will
    be NFS mounted on the client:

<P><PRE>
cp -p /usr/local/sbin/gpm /opt/ltsp-4.2/i386/sbin/
</PRE>

    <P></LI><LI> Getting sshd working is a little tricker:

<P><PRE>
cp -p /usr/sbin/sshd /home/local/ltsp-4.2/i386/sbin/
mkdir /home/local/ltsp-4.2/i386/etc/ssh/
ssh-keygen -q -t rsa1 -f etc/ssh/ssh_host_key     -C 'kiosks' -N ''
ssh-keygen -q -t rsa  -f etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -C 'kiosks' -N ''
ssh-keygen -q -t dsa  -f etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key -C 'kiosks' -N ''
</PRE>

    (Yeah, this means that all kiosks will use the same host key.
     Yeah, that's bad.  So sue me.)

    <P> Then create <TT>/opt/<WBR>ltsp-4.2/<WBR>i386/<WBR>etc/<WBR>shadow</TT>
    to give the local "root" user on the thin clients a password.

    <P></LI><LI> Make it possible to remotely reboot the kiosks:

     <P> Create a file <TT>/opt/<WBR>ltsp-4.2/<WBR>i386/<WBR>sbin/<WBR>rebootme</TT>
     that contains only two lines:

<P><PRE>
#!/bin/sh
exec /sbin/reboot
</PRE>

     and in <TT>/opt/ltsp-4.2/i386/etc/passwd</TT>, add:
<P><PRE>
reboot::0:0:root:/root:/sbin/rebootme
</PRE>

     Now you can do <TT>"ssh reboot@kiosk07"</TT> to reboot it
     without a password.

    <P></LI><LI> Make Ctrl-Alt-DEL reboot the remote clients by adding

<P><PRE>
ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
</PRE>

to <TT>/usr/local/ltsp-4.2/i386/etc/inittab.base</TT>.

    <P></LI><LI> Make the kiosks know what time it is:

<P><PRE>
cd /home/local/ltsp-4.2/i386/etc
ln -sf ../usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific localtime
cp -p /usr/sbin/hwclock /home/local/ltsp-4.2/i386/usr/sbin
</PRE>

<P>and then for each kiosk:

<P><PRE>
ssh root@kiosk<I><U>NN</U></I> date `date +%m%d%H%M.%S`
ssh root@kiosk<I><U>NN</U></I> hwclock --noadjfile --utc --systohc

<H2 NAME="auto-login">Configure auto-login.</H2>
<DIV CLASS="indent">

    <P> Right now, the kiosks are remote X terminals.  The next step
    is to make them be <I>anonymous</I> terminals.  The basic idea
    here is that instead of having GDM put up login prompt, we want it
    to automatically log in as the user "guest" as soon as it starts
    up.  Or rather, we want the kiosk03 host to log in as the user
    "guest03", and so on.

    <P> Furthermore, when a guest user logs in, their home directory
    should be re-initialized from a read-only known state (so that
    simply typing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace will reset things to a known
    state, and get rid of any configuration changes and files that the
    previous user of the terminal might have made.)

    <P><UL TYPE=DISC>

    <LI> First, log in as one of the guest users, and set up their X
    environment the way you want it to be.  Log out and save the
    configuration.  Then make a copy of that guest user's directory
    in the <TT>guest-ro</TT> directory (that we created earlier),
    which we will use as a template:

<P><PRE>
cp -a /home/guest01 /home/guest/guest-ro
chown -R guest-ro:guest /home/guest/guest-ro
</PRE>

    <P></LI><LI> Delete all the files in <TT>/etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/</TT>
    except for "Default".  Things get confused if a user ever selects a
    non-default session-style, so make there be only one available.
    The "Default" session is the one that runs <TT>~/.xsession</TT>
    to launch the user's applications.

    <P></LI><LI> Since GDM will auto-login, avoid confusion by
    removing the login box from the GDM greeter screen by using a 
    <A HREF="sbin/dnagdm/">custom GDM theme</A> that just leaves
    out all the various text-areas and displays our
    <A HREF="sbin/loading.gif">"loading, please wait"</A> image.
    Install this directory in <TT>/usr/<WBR>share/<WBR>gdm/<WBR>themes/<WBR>dnalounge/</TT>.

    <P></LI><LI> Configure GDM itself: edit
    <TT>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</TT> with these options:

<P><PRE>
AutomaticLoginEnable=true
AutomaticLogin=/usr/local/sbin/kioskname|
TimedLoginEnable=true
TimedLogin=/usr/local/sbin/kioskname|
TimedLoginDelay=5
RemoteGreeter=/usr/bin/gdmgreeter
AllowRoot=false
AllowRemoteRoot=false
AllowRemoteAutoLogin=true
Enable=true
SystemMenu=false
BackgroundType=1
BackgroundImage=/usr/local/etc/images/loading.gif
BackgroundRemoteOnlyColor=false
GraphicalTheme=dnalounge
</PRE>

    <P> Now, here's the tricky part!  For GDM to know which user
    to auto-login as, we set both the "AutomaticLogin" and
    "TimedLogin" fields to <TT>/usr/local/sbin/kioskname|</TT>.
    Note the bar at the end: that means that instead of being
    a user name, this is a script to run that <I>prints out</I>
    the name of the user to log in as.
    <A HREF="sbin/kioskname"><B>That script</B></A> is a shell
    script that looks at <TT>$DISPLAY</TT> to figure out the
    name/number of the kiosk in question, and prints out an
    appropriate user.

    <P> So this means, gdm will launch, and then 5 seconds later,
    will run this script and then auto-login as (e.g.) "guest05".

    <P><DIV STYLE="border: 1px solid; padding: 1em;">

      <I STYLE="font-size: larger; color:#F00;"><B>NOTE:</B></I>
      This works with GDM 2.4.1 on Red Hat 9.

      <P> I was never able to get TimedLogin to run a script with the
      version of GDM (2.6) that shipped with Fedora Core 4.  Nor was I
      able to get GDM 2.4.1 to build on FC4.

      <P> That is why I'm still running RH9 on the kiosks instead
      of something newer!

     <LI> <B>Using the machine too early.</B>

        <P> People kept trying to start using the machines while they

        thing my startup scripts do is set the root window image to be
        one that has <B>``Loading, Please Wait''</B> written on it in
        inch high letters.  The <I>last</I> thing the startup scripts
        do is set the background image to something prettier.

        <P> Of course, this problem went away when we upgraded to
        newer machines that boot really fast.

     <P></LI><LI> <B>Mouse buttons.</B>

        <P> The kiosks are set up with a three-button trackball as a
        pointing device.  Experience shows that people had no idea
        which button to use: I watched people try to select things with
        the right button (causing menus to pop up, and stay up,
        cluttering the screen.)  Then every now and then they'd hit the
        left button, and something would work right; but then they'd go
        back to using the right button or middle again.

        <P> This may be partly because people aren't familiar with
        trackballs, and it may be partly because of the position of the
        trackball; but the bottom line is, it wasn't working.  We
        needed all three buttons to do the same thing.  Opening up the
        trackball and rewiring it would have been a lot of work, so I
        found a software solution.

        <P> (I decided that, for the applications we're using, it was
        ok to discard the middle and right buttons: none of the apps
        that we expect to be used <I>require</I> usage of the right
        button to work properly, and people can always paste using
        Edit/Paste on the menubar.)

        <P> For GTK programs, it's easy: James Henstridge wrote
        <TT><B><A HREF="sbin/onebutton.c">onebutton.c</A></B></TT>,
        which is a GTK library that intercepts mouse events and makes
        all button clicks look like the left button.  This mostly works
        really well; the one place it fails is on scrollbars: you can
        only pick up and drag the thumb of a scrollbar with the left
        button.  Clicking on the arrows or in the scrollbar gutter works
        with any button, however.  Use it like this:

<P><PRE>
gcc -fPIC `gtk-config --cflags` -c onebutton.c
gcc -shared onebutton.o -o onebutton.so
export GTK_MODULES=/usr/local/lib/onebutton.so
</PRE>

          </DD>
          <DT><B>Netscape 4.<I>x</I>:</B></DT><DD>

        <P> For Netscape, there's a different solution, since Netscape
        is the only non-GTK program we're using.  For that, I hacked
        up the app-defaults file to remap things as much as I could 
        so that all three buttons did the same thing.  The file is
        <TT><B><A HREF="sbin/Netscape.ad">Netscape.ad</A></B></TT>.
        Use it like this:

<P><PRE>
mv Netscape.ad /usr/local/etc/app-defaults/Netscape
export XUSERFILESEARCHPATH='/usr/local/etc/app-defaults/%N%C%S'
</PRE>

        <P> Clicks inside an HTML page and on the toolbars work with 
        any mouse button, but the menubar only works with the left
        button; I don't think there's any way around that without
        modifying the Motif library.

        <P> But that completely failed to work with Mozilla, which has

        Jackasses.  So, a few people suggested another way: by using

         <DL>
          <DT><B>GPM:</B></DT><DD>

        <P> Normally, the <B>gpm</B> program is used for making the
        mouse work on the text console and things like that, but you
        can also use it as a layer that sits between your actual mouse,
        and the X server.  And you can use it to re-map buttons!  But,
        not to re-map all buttons to the same button... For that you
        need to patch the gpm source (as of gpm-1.20.1.)

        <P> Note that you have to be careful about the mouse protocol:
        the <B>-t</B> option to gpm tells you what protocol your
        <I>actual</I> mouse speaks, but the <B>-R</B> redirection stuff
        seems to only work with the MouseSystems (<B>msc</B>) protocol,
        so what the X server sees is MouseSystems data.

     <P></LI><LI> <B>Multi-clicks.</B>

        <P> Every single person assumed that they had to double-click
        on icons to launch programs, and so every single person ended
        up launching multiple copies of it.  And then that slowed the
        machine down, so they assumed their click didn't work, and
        clicked again.  And so on.

        <P> I solved this by writing a program that sits between the
        panel icons and the applications: It's called
        <TT><B><A HREF="sbin/runonce.c">runonce.c</A></B></TT>,
        and what it does is, notice when the program it's trying to
        launch is already running, and in that case, simply raise 
        its window.  It also keeps track of programs it has just
        launched that haven't had time to map their windows yet.
        Use it by editing the command executed by the panel icons
        like so:

<P><PRE>
runonce XTerm xterm -fg black -bg white
</PRE>

        <P> Where ``XTerm'' is the application name, application class,
        or window title of the window that the program maps; and the
        rest of the line is the command-line used to launch the
        program.

     <P></LI><LI> <B>Obscure icons.</B>

        <P> The Gnome panel doesn't have text titles underneath the
        icons: it only has tooltips that appear when the mouse hovers
        over the icon for a while.

        <P> Nobody realizes this.  

        <P> So what they do is, they click on the icons to see what
        they do.  Thus launching applications they don't need, and
        slowing down the machine while five programs they don't even
        really want to use try to start up at once.

        <P> I solved this by giving the applications different icons
        that include text in them (``IRC'', ``AIM'', etc.)  A better
        solution, of course, would be for the panel to have an option
        to display the tooltip text right in the panel.  Then it would
        be localized and everything.

<A HREF="//www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/07/05.html">Jul 2009</A>,
I made an attempt to upgrade the kiosks to a more modern Linux,
specifically from a 2003-vintage Red Hat 9 to a 2008-vintage
Ubuntu 7.10.  I <I>almost</I> got them to work, but they
were too flaky to use.  They crashed all the time (I suppose
we can blame the video drivers for this) and it was a very 
inconvenient kind of crash.  It was not the kind of crash
where the machine reboots.  It was the kind of crash where
someone has to <I>physically press the reset button.</I>
So that was pretty much a non-starter.  But if you like, you
