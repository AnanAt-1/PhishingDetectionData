<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Pearl Steps Down at Holy Cross; Takes Over 
  at Milton </font></b></p>
<p><b>Paul Pearl,</b> the head coach at Holy Cross (MAAC) for the past eight years, 
  will be leaving the Worcester hilltop to coach hockey and work in admissions 
  at Milton Academy. </p>
<p>We have no word on a potential successor at Holy Cross. </p>
<p>Pearl, a Holy Cross grad and a defensman on the hockey team, is making the 
  move because of lifestyle considerations. He has a son and a daughter who hope 
  to be attending Milton, and he's looking forward to rebuilding the Milton program, 
  which has fallen on hard times in recent years. </p>
<p>Pearl was recommended for the Milton job by <b>Paul Marks</b>, who has been 
  head coach there for the last five years. Marks, who has a full-time job in 
  the insurance business and suffered from the death of his mother in the middle 
  of last season, said he wants to be able to spend more time with his own children. 
  Marks says that to run a top-notch prep program today you need someone who is 
  involved with the school all the time.</p>
<p>&quot;It's time to have someone in with the admissions people and athletic 
  people, someone breaking bread with them everyday,&quot; he said. In my situation, 
  it was too easy for them to say no to me.&quot;</p>
<p>For one more year, Marks will stay on and work with Pearl. </p>
<p>Pearl coached Crusaders to a 116-114-19 record. Of the school's eight most 
  successful seasons, Pearl was behind the bench for five of them. Before returning 
  to his alma mater, Pearl was an assistant at Brown. Pearl has also worked extensively 
  with the Massachusetts Satellite Program and Mass. select teams. </p>
<p> We have no idea who, if anyone, Holy Cross has in mind to take Pearl's place.

<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Wiseman Returns to College Game</font></b></p>
<p><b>Brian Wiseman</b>, a star forward at the University of Michigan in the early 
  '90s, has been named an assistant on <b>Len Quesnelle</b>'s staff at Princeton.</p>
<p>After graduation, Wiseman, a 31-year-old native of Chatham, Ont., played six 
  years of minor pro hockey (and three games with the Toronto Maple Leafs). For 
  the last two years he has been a video coach with the Dallas Stars. </p>
<p>The other two who were in the hunt for the job were former Princeton star forward 
  <b>Andre Faust</b> and former Vermont assistant <b>Pat Norton.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2">6/24/03</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5">It's Sneddon</font></b></p>
<p><b>Kevin Sneddon</b> will be named the University of Vermont's new head coach 
  at a 3 p.m. press conference in Burlington today. </p>
<p>For the last five years, Sneddon, 33, has been the head coach at Union, and 
  has gained a lot of respect in hockey circles with the job he's done there. 
  His first year at Union, 1998-99, the team was 3-26-3, then improved the next 
  year to 8-24-1, then again to 12-18-4, then one more time, to 13-13-6. This 
  past season the Dutchmen slipped back a bit, finishing at 14-18-4, though losing 
  goaltender <b>Brandon Snee</b> to graduation certainly had something to do with 
  that. </p>
<p>Prior to taking over as head coach, Sneddon had been an assistant there on 
  the staff of <b>Stan Moore</b> and, before that, <b>Bruce Delventhal.</b> Taken 
  all together, he's been there ten years. </p>
<p>Sneddon, a native of Burlington, Ont (not too many people get to live in two 
  towns of the same name in their lifetime) played Tier II with the Burlington 
  Cougars Jr. B squad and arrived at Harvard Univeristy in the fall of '88, instantly 
  becoming a regular on the team that would go on to compile a 31-3-0 record and 
  bring a National Championship to Cambridge. </p>
<p>As a defenseman, Sneddon, 6'1&quot;, 200 lbs., was unspectacular but extremely 
  reliable, a guy who kept it simple and made the smart decision time after time. 
  The Kings drafted him in the 12th round in the 1989 NHL draft, but Sneddon suffered 
  injuries in his junior and senior seasons and never made it to the NHL. He knows 
  what it takes to succeed at that level, though, as his father, <b>Bob Sneddon</b>, 
  was a journeyman goaltender in the '60s and '70s. </p>
<p>Sneddon will be as popular in Vermont as he is among his peers. He's a gentleman, 
  plain and simple. And while he's very easygoing, once a game starts some of 
  the <b>Billy Cleary</b> influence shines through, and he can get intense. </p>
<p>The final two candidates are being reported as being <b>Roger Grillo</b> and 
  Sneddon. What might have tipped the scales in Sneddon's favor was the reaction 
  of the players, who met with the candidates themselves and then passed their 
  feelings on to the search committee. We know for a fact that Sneddon was far 
  and away the coach who most impressed the players.<br>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Draft Numbers</font></b></p>
<p>After Saturday's first three rounds were complete,<b> Zach Parise</b>, a steal 
  for the Devils at #17, told a reporter, &quot;I can't remember the last time 
  there were this many Americans ranked this high.&quot;</p>
<p>He's only 18, so the number of drafts he's pulling up from his memory bank 
  is short, but he's right. The eight US-born first round picks on Saturday were 
  one more than the seven in 1986. </p>
<p>Back in '86, that was an eye-popping number, especially coming on the heels 
  of '85, when only one American, Belmont Hill's<b> Chris Biotti</b>, was drafted 
  in the first round. Biotti was the only first round pick that year to never 
  play a single game in the NHL. A 6'3&quot;, 200 lb. d-man who played at Harvard 
  for two years before leaving to sign a minor league contract, Biotti's career 
  stalled out in the minors.</p>
<p>In 1986, however, there were some big names and all but one US-born first rounder 
  that year made it to the NHL. The exception was 6'3&quot;, 235 lb. Bemidji HS 
  RW George Pelawa, who died in a car crash that summer. The six US-born first 
  rounders from that year's draft who made it to the NHL were <b>Jimmy Carson, 
  Dan Woodley, Brian Leetch, Scott Young, Craig Janney, </b>and<b> Tom Fitzgerald.</b> 
  (Woodley, an American only by birth, played his hockey in Canada. Picked seventh 
  overall, he played only five NHL games in his career.)</p>
<p>However, after those first rounders, the US talent dropped off fast. Only five 
  Americans picked in rounds 2-9 -- <b>Dave Capuano</b> (Mt. St. Charles), <b>Dennis 
  Vaske </b>(Armstonrg HS), <b>Bob Corkum</b> (University of Maine), <b>Lance 
  Pitlick</b> (Cooper HS), and<b> Dan Keczmer</b> (Little Caesar's) -- played 
  in 100 or more NHL games. Kind of sobering, isn't it? But those are the odds.</p>
<p>This year, the top end is higher, and overall it's a deep draft, for the US 
  and everyone else. </p>
<p>As for numbers, there were 60 US kids drafted over the weekend, one more than 
  last year. The major difference is one of quality. In this year's draft more 
  U.S. kids were taken in the top two rounds, and fewer in the last four. By rounds, 
  the weekend's draft looked like this: 8, 10, 6, 6, 12, 3, 3, 5, and 7.</p>
<p>Notes: </p>
<p>Where did the 60 drafted Americans play last year? The answer:</p>
<p>NCAA -- 16 <br>
  USHL -- 14 <br>
  Major Junior -- 12<br>
  US High School -- 10<br>
  NAHL -- 3<br>
  EJHL -- 2<br>
  US Under-18 Team -- 2<br>
  BCHL -- 1<br>
</p>
<p>-- Of the 16 U.S.-born collegians, Dartmouth and CC had two apiece, while a 
  dozen other schools had one apiece. (For the record, six foreigners were also 
  drafted out of college, bringing the number of the weekend's draftees playing 
  in the NCAA last season to 22.)</p>
<p>-- Of the 14 USHL players, four were from Lincoln, three from River City and 
  Des Moines, two from Chicago, and one apiece from Sioux Falls and Waterloo. 
  Cedar Rapids, Green Bay, Sioux City, Topeka, and Tri-City didn't have any. </p>
<p>-- Of the 10 U.S. high school/prep school players, four were from St. Sebastian's, 
  while six other schools had one player apiece. The St. Sebastian's mark ties 
  the record set by Edina High School in '82 and the Northwood School in '87. 
</p>
<p>(The first of the four Edina players drafted in '82 was LW <b>Dave Maley</b>, 
  who went on to the University of Wisconsin and a long NHL career. None of the 
  other three -- C <b>Wally Chapman</b>, RW <b>John DeVoe</b>, and D<b> Bill Brauer</b> 
  -- reached the NHL. It was a similar story at Northwood, where only one of the 
  four teammates drafted in '87 made it to the NHL. That was RW <b>Chris Winnes</b>, 
  who went on to UNH and a brief 33-game NHL career. His teammate, RW <b>Chris 
  Jensen</b>, drafted before him, didn't play in the NHL at all. Neither did goalie 
  <b>Mark Felicio</b> and C <b>Mike Lappin</b>.)</p>
<p> -- St. Sebastian's is the first U.S. prep or high school to have two first 
  round NHL draft picks in consecutive years -- <b>Mike Morris</b> in 2002, and 
  Boyle this past weekend.</p>
<p>-- Both EJHL players selected came from the New England Jr. Coyotes, headed 
  up for over 25 years now by <b>Gary Dineen</b> , who played on the 1964 Toronto 
  Marlboros Memorial Cup team. </p>
<p>-- Twelve Americans who played in the CHL were drafted over the weekend, which 
  is a record number of Yanks. Last year, only five Americans playing major junior 
  were drafted. </p>
<p>-- The number of players drafted out of major junior was 118 this year (40 
  WHL; 45 OHL; 33 QMJHL). In 2002, 101 players (43 WHL; 35 OHL, 23 QMJHL) were 
  drafted out of major junior.</p>
<p>-- Nineteen players (including one American) were drafted off of Canadian Tier 
  II teams, up from 12 last year. </p>
<p>-- One player was drafted off of a Quebec Midget AAA squad and that's Lennoxville's 
  <b>Marcus Smith</b>, a goaltender who has already been recruited to Sacred Heart 
  University (MAAC). Smith, picked in the sixth round, is the first-ever MAAC 
  recruit to be drafted. <b>(Ben Blais</b> doesn't count, as he transferred to 
  Quinnipiac from St. Lawrence.)<br>
</p>
<p>-- Fifteen players who played in the NTDP were drafted.</p>
<p>Total numbers: 142 Canadians were drafted (48%); 60 Americans (20%), and 91 
  Europeans playing in Europe (31%.) For the third consecutive year, the number 
  of Europeans went down -- from 123, to 119, to 110, and now 91. (The number 
  is actually a little higher because a few players, like<b> Thomas Vanek</b>, 
  who played for North American teams, were not included.) </p>
<p>U.S. skaters listed on Central's final North American rankings who didn't opt 
  in or simply weren't drafted were: John Vigilante (Plymouth); Travis Morin (Chicago 
  Steel); Bobby Selden (US Under18); Mike Curry (Sioux City); Tim Wallace (Notre 
  Dame); Jamie Milam (NMU); Matt Hayek (Lincoln); Matt Hartman (Sioux City); Jake 
  Wilkens (Vernon); Christian Jensen (Yale); Tyler Hirsch (Minnesota); Drew Larman 
  (Sarnia); Chris Kelley (Deerfield); Dave Germain (NMH); Todd Fletcher (Chelmsford 
  HS); Joey Zappala (Yale); Greg Schultz (New Eng. Jr. Coyotes); Bill LeClerc 
  (St. Paul's School); Ray Ortiz (Belmont Hill); Sean Hurley (NMH); Mike Hartwick 
  (Boston Bulldogs); and Noah Babin (Green Bay). Goalies on the final rankings 
  who were not drafted were: Dominic Vicari (River City); Travis Weber (Minnesota); 
  Josh Gartner (Yale); Josh Johnson (Green Bay); and A.J. Bucchino (Des Moines).</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5">O'Sullivan and the Draft</font></b></p>
<p>Pre-draft, there was a lot of talk about the possibility of Mississauga IceDogs 
  center Patrick O'Sullivan dropping out of the first round and a team getting 
  a crack at him early in the second. However, the 5'11&quot;, 190 lb. center 
  lasted until the bottom of the second round, when the the Minnesota Wild took 
  him with the 55th overall pick.</p>
<p>A year ago, O'Sullivan was being spoken of as a top five pick. </p>
<p>For those of you who have read the Hockey Report for awhile, you probably know 
  about the sad saga of Patrick O'Sullivan and his father, <b>John O'Sullivan.</b> 
  We first got hip to it five years ago when O'Sullivan, as a 13 year old, played 
  in the U.S. Select 15 Festival after his father had falsified documents. As 
  the years went by, other stories came out concerning ways in which young Patrick 
  was abused by his father. In the 2001-02 season, John O'Sullivan, who played 
  minor league hockey and, while fairly short, is pretty well put-together, beat 
  up on his son. Patrick realized he needed protection, filed assault charges, 
  and got a restraining order against his father, who pleaded guilty and spent 
  22 days in jail.</p>
<p>Think about being 16, as O'Sullivan was at the time, and taking a restraining 
  order out on your very own father. And think about the years of physical and 
  emotional abuse, though. You don't get out from under that easily. Last December, 
  O'Sullivan stole six sticks from a Mississauga sporting goods store. As IceDogs 
  coach <b>Steve Ludzik</b> said, &quot;It was a cry for help.&quot;</p>
<p>Ludzik immediately sent O'Sullivan home, telling the press it was due to on-ice 
  defensive indifference, though you can be sure that O'Sullivan's dad did not 
  reward defensive efforts one-tenth as much as offensive ones. In December, O'Sullivan 
  went home to his mother and sisters down in Winston-Salem, NC, and didn't return 
  to Ontario until the next month. O'Sullivan, with protection from a U.S. Federal 
  Marshall, and his dad in attendance anyway, had a mediocre tournament. His stock 
  started dropping, but even on Central's final list, which came out in mid-May, 
  he was still projected to go #14 overall.</p>
<p>But 55th?</p>
<p>Pro teams, even in this age of psychologial testing, have traditionally backed 
  off players who have emotional issues. </p>
<p>It's a fact, however, that some of the the greatest pro athletes out there 
  have heavy emotional burdens they carry every day. A couple have opened up to 
  talk about it. <b>Terry Bradshaw</b>, a Hall of Fame quarterback who played 
  for four Super Bowl winners and is now in the Football Hall of Fame, suffered 
  for decades with depression. 1998 Heisman trophy winner <b>Ricky Williams</b> 
  had a severe case of social anxiety disorder. Low self-esteem and feelings of 
  worthlessness are a major component in practically all psychological disorders. 
  Elite level athletes are under a great deal of pressure, which often exacerbates 
  the problem. </p>
<p>Anyway, O'Sullivan has gotten a lot of press recently. ESPN the Magazine did 
  a very good story in it's June 23 issue about the situation. In the story, which 
  you can probably find at espn.com, a pro scout was quoted as saying, &quot;Kids 
  from a troubled family hardly ever pan out.&quot;</p>
<p>If this is true, we'd like to see some proof. This reporter has been around 
  long enough to see people in all walks of life doing spectacularly well in their 
  work even while battling all kinds of demons. Those are the ones you don't hear 
  about, even though they make up the majority, because good news doesn't sell 
  papers. The ones you hear about are the spectacular flameouts, hence the scout's 
  comment. </p>
<p>Drafting a player -- any player, particularly in the high rounds -- is a risk. 
  The best rule to follow is simply to draft for skill. If you don't, it's going 
  to come back and bite you -- a recent exhibit would be undrafted <b>Martin St. 
  Louis</b> in Tampa Bay, who was overlooked for a long, long time. Skill is always 
  at a premium. If you have a good number of high-skill players in your system, 
  you at least have someone to trade when it's time to fill a specific need. </p>
<p>One more thing: If O'Sullivan had been taken in the first round, he would have 
  gotten the one million plus rookie salary cap. Dropping to the second round 
  cost him all that. Our sense is that when you watch O'Sullivan next season, 
  you'll see a man on a mission. </p>

<p>Obermeyer, a 1/9/85 birthdate from Chanhassen, Minn., will play two years with

<p>While very skilled, Obermeyer is on the thin side and needs to put on some 
  muscle before playing in the WCHA, hence the USHL stint. He also needs to gain 
  more experience playing on the blue line. </p>
<p>Obermeyer stood out at the Great 8 Tournament, held at the Wakota Arena in 
  South St. Paul on the last weekend in March. One of those in attendance was 
  Tech assistant coach <b>Marc Maroste. </b></p>

<p>New Michigan Tech coach <b>Jamie Russell </b>has hired <b>Ian Kallay </b>as 
  an assistant.</p>
<p>Kallay, 29, who has coached the Drayton Valley Thunder of the Alberta Junior 
  Hockey League for the past two seasons, was named the league's coach of the 
  year this season.</p>
<p>Kallay, a Calgary native, played his college hockey at the University of North 
  Dakota, where he was a forward. After a stint playing in the ECHL, Kallay worked 
  as an assistant under <b>Mark Osiecki</b> with the Green Bay Gamblers (USHL).</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for Kallay's hiring is the fact that he is plugged 
  into the western Canada talent pool. Look for Tech, which now has a head coach 
  from British Columbia, and an assistant from Alberta, to direct much of their 
  recruiting efforts toward those provinces. This past season, the Huskies had 
  only two players from Alberta (forwards <b>Colin Murphy</b> and <b>Jon Pittis)</b>, 
  and one from B.C. (freshman forward <b>Matt Gibbons</b>).</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Vermont Update</b></font></p>
<p>The five finalists for the UVM job are Catamounts assistant <b>Damian DiGiulian</b>, 
  former U. of Calgary head coach and Atlanta Thrashers assistant coach <b>Tim 
  Bothwell</b>, Brown head coach <b>Roger Grillo</b>, Union head coach <b>Kevin 
  Sneddon</b>, and U.S. Under-17 Team head coach <b>David Quinn. </b></p>
<p>One finalist per day will be interviewed and meet with Corran and the search 
  committee. We are unsure of the exact number or actual makeup of the committee, 
  but we do know that the committee is advisory in nature and that Corran and 
  the university president have the final say. Also, <b>Mike Gilligan</b>, while 
  he may or may not be on the actual committee, is a key figure in the whole process 
  and that most of the communication between the candidates and the athletic administration 
  goes through him. In addition, assistant AD <b>Jeff Schulman</b>, a former Catamounts 
  defenseman, is also a key figure. Other members of the committee include a couple 
  of faculty members, a couple of former players in the area, and a couple of 
  boosters from the Friends of Vermont Hockey. On top of all that, current players 
  who are in town for the summer have the opportunity to meet each of the candidates. 
</p>
<p>Sources close to the scene report that the search is open and that Bothwell 
  is not a lock for the job. </p>
<p>In 2000, Bothwell was Corran's #1 choice for the Duluth job, but a lot of negative 
  feedback resulted from the fact that Bothwell was coming from a Canadian university 
  and not the NCAA. After Corran was overruled, <b>Scott Sandelin</b>, an Iron 
  Ranger who had been an assistant for five years at his alma mater, the University 
  of North Dakota, was apponted to take over the Bulldogs program. </p>
<p>In 1997, Bothwell was offered the head coaching job at Brown, his alma mater, 
  but turned it down. </p>
<p>In other Vermont news, between having a new university president and a new 
  AD, a lot of energy is being directed toward the hockey program. The president 
  is already working on getting a new 8,000 seat, $40 million arena built on the 
  edge of campus. A public/private endeavour, it is expected to require very little 
  in the way of UVM capital expenditure. </p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Corran Getting Closer?</font></b></p>
<p>New Vermont Athletic Director <b>Bob Corran</b> is at his desk in the school's 
  athletic department today. Job #1 is to begin the face-to-face interviewing 
  process, and decide who will be the next Catamounts coach. </p>
<p>Vermont assistant <b>Damian DiGiulian</b>, who's been at the school for six 
  years, is reportedly getting an interview today, with one more candidate being 
  interviewed each day this week, for a total of five. </p>
<p>Going into the weekend, it looked like the top candidates for the job -- and 
  we cross-checked it among numerous sources -- were Brown coach <b>Roger Grillo</b>, 
  Union coach <b>Kevin Sneddon</b>, Colgate coach <b>Donnie Vaughan</b>, recent 
  Atlanta Thrashers assistant <b>Tim Bothwell</b>, and University of Minnesota 
  assistant <b>Bob Motzko.</b> </p>
<p>All five of those names came from a group of applicants that included six current 
  Div. I head coaches, a large pool of assistants, and a number of men not currently 
  in the college game. </p>
<p>The last group could be the X factor in the process, mainly because, despite 
  significant overlap, many of the pro guys are outsiders to many in the college 
  hockey community, so news of their interest is less likely to circulate down 
  to the college game. </p>
<p>We know that ex-Lake Superior State coach, NTDP founder, and Guelph Storm (OHL) 
  head coach <b>Jeff Jackson</b> applied for the job, but there has been no mention 
  of his name lately, which may or may not mean anything, but seems odd considering 
  the length of his resume, which also includes coaching the US to its best-ever 
  finish in the World Juniors and serving as an assistant for the 1998 Olympic 
  team in Nagano, Japan. However, several sources have mentioned that Corran is 
  looking for someone young. That could mean Sneddon, but the word is that the 
  former Harvard defenseman has pulled out of the process. Sneddon, 31, already 
  has five years as a Div. I head coach under his belt. It could also mean U.S. 
  Under-17 coach <b>David Quinn</b>, 36, whose name has come up as well. </p>
<p>One assistant conspicious by his absence is BC assistant <b>Ron Rolston</b>, 
  36, who has a lengthy list of accomplishments at Lake State, Clarkson, Harvard, 
  and now BC. We simply haven't heard his name. </p>
<p>A head coach extremely conspicuous by his absence is Dartmouth coach <b>Bob 
  Gaudet</b>, who has already proven he can do what UVM wants done -- that is, 
  turn a loser into a winner. Remember that in Gaudet's first year at Brown, the 
  Bears went 1-25-0, but four years later, with every player on board brought 
  on by Gaudent, Brown reached the NCAA tournament for the first time in 17 years. 
  At Dartmouth, the pattern is repeating itself. Once Gaudet had a team composed 
  entirely of his recruits in place, they started winning -- and haven't stopped 
  yet. </p>
<p>Reportedly, Gaudet hasn't even been asked to drive from Hanover to Burlington 
  for a face-to-face interview. Little things like that have caused some people 
  to wonder if the fix is in, and that it has already been decided that the job 
  will go to Bothwell, the 48-year old former Brown defenseman. </p>
<p>We're also wondering, if indeed Bothwell was so great at the University of 
  Calgary, where Corran was the AD, then why didn't the latter hire him when the 
  Duluth job was opened in the spring of 2000. After all, Bothwell was in his 
  mid-forties then and, after a 13-year NHL career, had served as a head coach 
  in major junior, the IHL, and the U. of Calgary. In addition, in the spring 
  of 1997, right after Gaudet moved on to Dartmouth and before Grillo was chosen 
  to take over the Bears, Bothwell had been offered, but declined, the Brown job. 
  It wasn't until a year later that Bothwell left Calgary to pursue the pros. 
  Midway through his second season, last Dec. 26, Atlanta head coach<b> Kurt Fraser</b> 
  and Bothwell, his assistant, were fired.</p>
<p>We have a feeling that Bothwell will end up with the job. We also have a feeling 
  this may have been settled a while ago, and everything since has been simply 
  the process taking its due course. That's purely a hunch, though. </p>

<p><i><b>UNH:</b></i> While <b>Dick Umile </b>is as New England as a saltbox house, 
  he's looked to the west when he's made his hires. <b>David Lassonde</b> was 
  an assistant at both Wisconsin and Miami-Ohio before coming back east. <b>Scott 
  Borek</b> was Jeff Jackson's assistant at Lake State, then took over as head 
  coach when Jackson left to start the National Program. Prior to that, <b>Brian 
  McCloskey</b>, a British Columbia native who used his knowledge of the BCHL 
  to come up with the likes of <b>Jason Krog </b>et al,.was a long-time assistant. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Cornell: </i>Mike Schafer</b>, before taking over at Cornell, put in 
  five years as an assistant at Western Michigan. New/old Cornell assistant <b>Scott 
  Garrow </b>has spent the last five years at Western Michigan, but is back at 
  his alma mater because <b>Jamie Russell</b>, who also coached five years at 
  Ferris State, is now back at Michigan Tech, his alma mater. <b>Brent Brekke</b> 
  played at Western and was an assistant coach/director of player personnel for 
  the now-defunct Chicago Freeze (NAHL). </p>
<p><b><i>BC:</i></b> <b>Jerry York</b> coached 15 years for Bowling Green. <b>Scotty 
  Paluch</b>, whose fingerprints are all over the strong BC teams of recent years, 
  is from Chicago, played for York at BGSU, and also coached under him both there 
  and at BC. Of course, Paluch is gone now, but his successor, <b>Ron Rolston</b>, 
  played at Michigan Tech and was an assistant at Lake State, Clarkson, and Harvard 
  before coming to the Heights. </p>
<p><i><b>Maine:</b></i> While <b>Tim Whitehead</b>, like Umile and York, is an 
  eastern guy, his staff is not. <b>Grant Standbrook</b> played his college hockey 
  for Minnesota-Duluth and built his reputation at Wisconsin, where he was <b>Bob 
  Johnson</b>'s chief recruiter. Assistant <b>Campbell Blair</b> is from British 
  Columbia. The Black Bears, of course, were built into a perennial contender 
  by<b> Shawn Walsh</b>, who coached under <b>Ron Mason</b> at both Bowling Green 
  and Michigan State before taking over at Maine in 1984. </p>
<p><b><i>Harvard:</i></b> <b>Mark Mazzoleni</b> won three NCAA Div. III title 
  in his six years at Wisconsin-Stevens Point, then was hired away by <b>Doug 
  Woog</b> to be an assistant with the Gophers. From there Mazzoleni moved on 
  to the CCHA, spending six years at Miami (Ohio) before moving on to the banks 
  of the Charles. </p>
<p><i></i>BU was the only team to make the NCAA playoffs without a coach with 
  experience out west. </p>
<p>We should note that Providence College, which finished fourth in Hockey East 
  behind UNH, BC, and Maine, also has a strong CCHA presence with head coach <b>Paul 
  Pooley</b>, a former Ohio State star forward who went on to work as an assistant 
  under Jackson at Lake State; and assistant coach <b>Dave Berard</b>, an easterner 
  who also went west to work as an assistant at Lake State for a couple of years. 
</p>
<p>All the remaining teams in Hockey East/ECAC -- and there are 14 others -- feature 
  staffs that are heavily eastern-based. Out of that group only four schools -- 
  Dartmouth, Yale, Brown, and UMass -- finished the season with an overall record 
  better than .500. </p>
<p>The western makeup of the coaching staffs at the top eastern programs is something 
  that's seldom talked about, perhaps because nobody wants to consider the fact 
  that it may be more than coincidence, but with the Vermont head job open, and 
  a possible assistant's slot or two riding shotgun, it's at least something to 
  think about. </p>
<p>After all, most of the highly successful programs mentioned above have a significant 
  number of players on their roster who hail from the mid-west and far west of 
  both Canada and the United States. </p>

<p><font size="2">6/14/03</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2"><b><font size="5">McCarthy to Boston University</font></b></font></p>
<p> 6'0&quot;, 190 lb. forward <b>John McCarthy</b> of St. John's Prep (Danvers, 
  Mass.) will be heading to BU in the fall of 2005.</p>
<p>McCarthy, a left-shot center, will be a senior in the upcoming season and then, 
  in 2004-05, will play a year of junior hockey before heading off to Babcock 
  St.</p>
<p>McCarthy, an 8/9/86 birthdate, is not the high-profile kid usually snapped 
  up early on. The Andover native, who is also the quarterback on St. John's prep 
  highly-ranked football team, has size, strength, athleticism, and competes hard. 
  We've seen him play a few times, but not against particularly strong competition, 
  so it's a little hard to get a line on him. He's not fast and doesn't have great 
  great stickhandling skills, but he's a smart player, a power forward type with 
  good awareness and passing skills. He has also shown a knack in the clutch. 
  He has a little way to go but with a couple years of work will compete for a 
  spot on the Terriers. </p>
<p> McCarthy will captain both the St. John's Prep football and hockey teams in 
  the upcoming season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2">6/11/03</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Hockey East Recruit Bound for QMJHL</b></font></p>
<p>6'2&quot;, 217 lb. UMass-Lowell recruit <b>Kevin Coughlin</b> is going major 
  junior with the Quebec Remparts.</p>
<p>Coughlin, a RW from South Boston, Mass., played several seasons at Cushing 
  Academy. This past season, his senior year, Coughlin played for the U.S. National 
  Team Development Program where, in 56 games, he posted a 4-6-10 line. For three 
  seasons before that he played at Cushing Academy.</p>
<p>Coughlin, a 4/23/85 birthdate whose father played at Michigan State in the 
  late '70s, was picked in the 7th round (#103 overall) in last year's QMJHL draft. 
</p>
<p>There are now five New England kids on the Remparts (see below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2">6/11/03</font></p>
<p align="center"> <font size="5"><b>Warriors on Deck</b></font></p>
<p>6'2&quot;, 190 lb. goaltender <b>Pat Watson</b>, who starred at Waltham (Mass.) 
  HS before taking a PG year at the Pomfret School this past season, has committed 
  to Merrimack College for the fall '05. </p>
<p>Watson will play the next two seasons for the Valley Jr. Warriors (EJHL), coached 
  by <b>Andy Heinze</b>.A 2/4/84 birthdate, Watson will enter Merrimack as a 21-year-old 
  freshman. The Waltham native has the tools -- size and athleticism -- but is 
  still a little raw.</p>
<p>Coming to Merrimack in the fall of '04 is Springfield Jr. Blues (NAHL) power 
  forward <b>Hank Carisio</b>. A Cheshire, Conn. native, Carisio posted a 25-36-61 
  line in 53 NAHL games. He also posted a whopping 253 pims, nearly five minutes 
  a game. </p>
<p>Carisio is expected to be back with the Jr. Blues in the fall. However, his 
  USHL rights are owned by the Lincoln Stars, who drafted him in the first round 
  of last month's draft. In 2002, Carisio was drafted by the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders.</p>
<p>Carisio, a left shot, is an 11/29/83 birthdate, so he, too, will be a 21-year-old 
  freshman. Before going to the NAHL he played for the Connecticut Clippers Jr. 
  B. </p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5">The Heat is On</font></b></p>
<p>Next week, the list of 46 players to be invited to the U.S. National Junior 
  Team Evaluation Camp (Aug. 3-10; Lake Plaid, NY) will be finalized, and there 
  will be a lot of familiar faces, as 11 players named to last year's team are 
  eligible again this year. </p>
<p>It's an experienced team , and has an excellent chance to win a gold medal. 
  Failing to medal at all, which has been the case over the last six years, would 
  be a huge disappointment, though hardly unprecedented. Over the 27-year history 
  of the tournament, the U.S. has won three medals, and not one of them was gold. 
  They have won a silver ('97) and a pair of bronze medals ('86 &amp; '92). </p>
<p>The last team that looked as good as this year's crop was probably the 1989 
  team which, with <b>Mike Modano, John LeClair, Jeremy Roenick, Bill Guerin</b>, 
  and <b>Tony Amonte</b> had five guys who could wind up in the Hall of Fame someday. 
  They also had <b>Steve Heinze, Joe Sacco, Peter Ciavaglia</b>, and future Hobey 
  Baker winner <b>David Emma</b> -- all guys who could score. And score they did, 
  45 times in 7 games, setting a U.S. record in the process. But they still finished 
  3-3-1, and had to settle for fifth place. The tournament was also on home ice 
  that year, in Anchorage, Alaska. </p>
<p>It hasn't been easy, that's for sure. </p>
<p>The grand pooh-bahs of USA Hockey know this team is good, and that's why they 
  tapped Wisconsin head coach <b>Mike Eaves</b> for the head job. Eaves is the 
  only coach to lead a U.S. team to a gold medal in an internationally-sanctioned 
  tournament outside of our fifty states. That was just 14 months ago, when the 
  U.S. Under-18 Team edged heavily-favored Russia , 3-1, in the title game of 
  the 2002 World Under-18 Championship in Piestany, Slovakia. Expect roughly 16 
  players off that team to be showing their stuff at Lake Placid in August. As 
  his assistants, Eaves has hired two coaches he trusts -- <b>Moe Mantha</b> (NTDP) 
  and <b>John Hynes </b>(Wisconsin).</p>
<p>How serious is the U.S. about jumping on this opportunity? Well, <b>Lou Vairo</b>, 
  who coached the team last year after a 21-year absence (he also coached the 
  junior team for four straight years between 1979-82) reportedly wanted to do 
  it again this season, but was passed over in favor of Eaves, who has a much 
  greater degree of familiarity with what the current player pool can do, obviously 
  an important consideration in a tournament for which practices and exhibition 
  games are at a premium. </p>
<p>Eaves will be the first college coach since Boston University's <b>Jack Parker 
  </b>in 1996 to serve as head coach for the national junior team. With both Eaves 
  and Hynes over in Helsinki, it also marks the first time in WJC history that 
  two coaches from the same college program also coached together at the tournament. 
  Assistant coach<b> Troy Ward </b>will run the Badgers over the holidays, with 
  help from <b>Bill Howard</b>. Eaves and Hynes will miss four games -- the Badger 
  Hockey Showdown and a two-game series against Mankato. </p>
<p>So, who's likely to be invited to the August evaluation camp? Here's how we 
  see it. Please remember that these are our views only, and do not necessarily 
  represent the views of the coaching and scouting staff. That said, we think 
  you'll see ninety percent -- or better -- of these guys in Lake Placid. </p>
<p> Up front, there are seven returnees: <b>Dustin Brown</b> ('84), <b>Ryan Kesler</b> 
  ('84), <b>Patrick O'Sullivan</b> ('85), <b>Greg Moore</b> ('84), <b>Zach Parise</b> 
  ('84), <b>Brett Sterling</b> ('84), and <b>Patrick Eaves</b> ('84), who was 
  replaced on the roster last December due to injury. We wouldn't be amazed to 
  see one of those guys not make the final cut in December as the U.S. has great 
  depth this time around. The potential newcomers to the national junior team 
  are <b>Danny Fritsche</b> ('85), <b>Hugh Jessiman </b>('84), <b>Josh Hennessy 
  </b>('85), <b>David Backes</b> ('84), <b>Ryan Potulny</b> ('84), <b>Tim Wallace</b> 
  ('84),<b> Robbie Schremp</b> ('86), <b>Stephen Werner</b> ('84), <b>David Booth</b> 
  ('84), <b>Drew Stafford </b>('85), <b>Robbie Earl</b> ('85), <b>Brian Boyle</b> 
  ('84), <b>John Vigilante</b> ('85), <b>Jake Dowell</b> ('85), <b>T.J. Hensick</b> 
  ('85), <b>Kevin Porter</b> ('86), and perhaps another '86, such as A<b>dam Pineault</b>. 
  That makes 24 -- two teams of 12. </p>
<p>On defense, there are three returnees: <b>Mark Stuart </b>('84), <b>Ryan Suter 
  </b>('85), and <b>James Wisniewski</b> ('84). After them, we are looking at 
  <b>Matt Carle</b> ('84), <b>Brian Lee</b> ('84), <b>Corey Potter</b> ('84), 
  <b>Danny Richmond</b> ('84), <b>Evan Shaw</b> ('84), <b>Jason Dest</b> ('84), 
  <b>Frank Rediker</b> ('85), <b>Jimmy Sharrow</b> ('85), <b>Jeff Likens </b>('85), 
  <b>Matt Smaby</b> ('84), <b>Tim Cook</b> ('84), <b>Kyle Klubertanz</b> ('85), 
  and <b>Matt Hunwick</b> ('85). That's our 16 -- two teams of eight. </p>
<p>In goal, there is just one returnee and that is <b>James Howard</b> III ('84). 
  The best candidate to join him on the team is, hands down, <b>Alvaro Montoya</b> 
  ('85). We expect <b>Dominic Vicari</b> ('84) to push those guys a bit, though 
  he doesn't have either college of major international experience, which puts 
  him in exactly the same position as Bobby Goepfert was in last year at this 
  time -- and Goepfert made the team. Others likely to get a camp invite are <b>Chris 
  Holt</b> ('85) and <b>Mike Brown </b>('85). After them we'll go with <b>Gerald 
  Coleman</b> ('85), and <b>Josh Gartner</b> ('84). Gartner is a dual citizen. 
  That's seven goalies which, since there are normally six goalies in camp, is 
  one too many. We'll leave it at that rather than try to split hairs. </p>
<p>On our list we have twenty-six '84s (3G, 11D, 13F); eighteen '85s (4G,5D,8F); 
  and three '86s (0G, 0D, 3F). A number of the players with world junior eligibility 
  in future years -- the '85s and '86s in this case -- will make the team that 
  heads to Helsinki in late December. Others will be seriously competitive for 
  a slot. Some may be the longest of long shots now, but will be right in the 
  picture next year. This is a good chance for those younger players to get their 
  feet wet, and for the staff to watch them against the top older kids. </p>
<p>The team is not picked at Lake Placid. Players are simply evaluated there, 
  and then followed throughout the fall, when a new candidate -- or two or three 
  -- could force his way into the picture. The team is named in late November/early 
  December.</p>
<p>The official camp roster is scheduled to be released in the days leading up 
  to the draft, which is on June 21-22 in Nashville, Tenn. </p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Ryan, Andricopoulos Top Yanks in QMJHL Draft</font></b></p>
<p>U.S. NTDP recruits<b> Joey Ryan</b>, from the Valley Jr. Warriors (EJHL); and 
  <b>Andrew Andricopoulos</b>, from Tabor Academy, were the top two U.S.-born 
  players selected on Saturday at the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League Draft, 
  held in Val-d'Or, Que.</p>
<p>Both 6'1&quot;, 198 lb. Ryan and 6'0&quot;, 177 lb. Andricopoulos are '87s 
  and right shot defensemen. Ryan was drafted by the Hull Olympiques franchise, 
  which is moving five kilometers upriver to Gatineau (where -- and this is the 
  obligatory seventh game of the Stanley Cup final content -- New Jersey Devils 
  head coach <b>Pat Burns</b> used to work as a police detective.) Andricopoulos, 
  who will not be going to the NTDP, was drafted by the Quebec Remparts.</p>
<p>What about the two players situations?</p>
<p><b><i>Joey Ryan:</i> </b> His father, <b>Bob Ryan</b>, a fireman from Malden, 
  Mass. said it &quot;was a shock&quot; his son went so high. &quot;We never spoke 
  to them,&quot; he said. &quot;As of right now, he's still going out to the National 
  Program and then to Merrimack.&quot;</p>
<p>Joey, like his brother before him, has been a student at the Landmark School 
  in Beverly, Mass., which is nationally recognized for its work with kids who 
  suffer learning disabilities. However, the city of Beverly, which picked up 
  the hefty $30,000 tab, will no longer do so on account of across-the-board budget 
  cuts. If the Landmark option had continued to be available to Ryan, the defenseman 
  would have stayed home and played for <b>Andy Heinze</b>'s Warriors squad again 
  in the upcoming season. The Ryans, who are dead serious about academics, are 
  hoping the Ann Arbor high schools will be able to carry on the work and help 
  Joey get through the NCAA clearinghouse. </p>
<p>If, however, Ryan fails to get through the clearinghouse two years from now 
  and then on to Merrimack, the family would, naturally, consider the QMJHL. And 
  Gatineau has his rights. It's a calculated risk on the Gatineau's part, but 
  one with a large potential payoff. Fifteen -year-old defensemen with two years 
  of junior experience and a mean streak don't exactly grow on trees.</p>
<p><b><i>Andrew Andricopoulos</i></b><i>:</i> Look for him to sign soon with Quebec, 
  which already has three New England kids -- forwards<b> Josh Hennessy</b> and 
  <b>Jordan LaVallee</b>, and defenseman <b>Evan Shaw</b> -- on board, and, in 
  addition to the former Tabor defenseman, also drafted Avon Old Farms RD <b>Adam 
  Blanchette</b>. Quebec hosted the Memorial Cup this season and Andricopoulos 
  was a guest of the Remparts, which are partly owned by ex-NHL goaltender <b>Patrick 
  Roy. </b></p>
<p>Andricopoulos is a smooth skater with strong puck-handling skills -- and has 
  good size, too.</p>
<p>This is the second straight season the Remparts have scooped up a player who 
  had previously committed to the National Program. Last year, it was LaVallee, 
  who previously played for the Walpole Stars (EJHL). </p>
<p>Here is the full list of American kids -- there were 17 total -- taken in Saturday's 
  draft. Because of geographical rights, the only Americans eligible to play in 
  the QMJHL are natives of the six New England states. </p>

<p>5'11&quot;, 195 lb. Waterloo Black Hawks (USHL) forward <b>Joe Pavelski</b> 
  has committed to the University of Wisconsin for the fall of '04. </p>
<p>Pavelski, a right-shot center and a native of Plover, Wisc., is a sniper who 
  played at Stevens Point HS through his junior year. Last fall he moved to the 
  USHL for his senior season, and made a significant impact, finishing the regular 
  season third in scoring and being named rookie of the year. </p>
<p>A 7/11/84 birthdate, Pavelski will return to Waterloo for another season, and 
  then enter Wisconsin with the recruiting class that includes defensemen <b>Nate 
  Hagemo </b>(NTDP) and <b>Kyle Klubertanz</b> (Green Bay); and forward <b>Matt 
  Auffrey</b> (NTDP). </p>
<p>Though other big-time schools were interested in Pavleski, but Pavelski only 
  wanted to play within driving distance of his family's central Wisconsin hometown. 
  The final four were Minnesota Duluth, Mankato State, Northern Michigan, and 
  Wisconsin. Madison is just a 103 mile drive from Plover -- by midwestern standards, 
  that's a drive around the block.<br>
