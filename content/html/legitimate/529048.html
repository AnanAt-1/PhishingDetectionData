    <div class="disp_doc2">
        <div class="disp_elm_title">Description:</div>
        <div class="disp_elm_text">
            <p>My invention relates to certain new improvements in drag-line and clam-shell dredges or excavators by which the movements of the dredge, forwardly, backwardly and turning, are greatly facilitated. </p>
<p>Heretofore dredges of this character have been provided with what is called a "tub"-a turning tub on which the excavator proper rests while at work and which tub is made to partly lift from the ground by the dredge operator, causing portable pontoons to be lowered. These pontoons are usually carried on the sides of the dredge and are kept up on the sides while the dredge is at work, so that the tub supports the whole weight of the superstructure while the dredge is at work. </p>
<p>This arrangement is open to various objections which it is an object of my invention to eliminate. </p>
<p>One of the objects of my invention is to provide a structure by virtue of which greater walking efficiency and turning movement of the dredge is made possible and the speed of operations may be increased. </p>
<p>Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide means whereby the whole understructure of the dredge that goes to make up my apparatus, as well as the dredge proper, is supported on movable trucks carried by the pontoons, and operator-controlled means are provided to start the trucks moving along the pontoons while the pontoons stand still, so that the dredge proper and the aforesaid under-structure may be moved at will. </p>
<p>Further, it is an object to provide a machine of great flexibility of movement in any direction and of greater ease in standing on soft soil, by virtue of the concurrent use of both pontoons and the tub for supporting the weight of the machine. </p>
<p>40 Further it is an object to provide a machine wherein the power shafts which serve to assist in maneuvering the machine are not used to sustain the lift or weight of the machine, that function being performed in my machine by the hydraulic jacks, the axles having to lift the pontoons only. This enables me to use much lighter shafts than heretofore and aids in accomplishing another object of the invention, namely, the reduction of the weight of the machine and the cost of construction. </p>
<p>Further, it is an object to provide a machine which is self-leveling and which can be used on uneven ground or ground having both hard and soft spots, without having to stop for placing mats, making mats for placement, or stopping work on account of sinking troubles in moving and working the machine. </p>
<p>Again, it is an object to provide a dredge or excavator in which, instead of mounting the dredge proper on the tub with a dolly interposed, the dredge proper is mounted on a bottom car which in turn is mounted on the tub (dollies being interposed between the dredge proper and the bottom car and between the bottom car and tub), the bottom car carrying the jacks and pontoons and shafts, cams, gearing, etc., for operating the same. </p>
<p>Further, the invention has for an object to provide a hollow king-pin for joining the dredge proper (upper car), the lower car and the tub together so they may turn on said pin as a vertical axis, each being adapted to be turned freely with respect to the others when desired, and to provide a main power or propeller shaft of tubular form to turn on said king-pin as a bearing, the said shaft extending from the top car only to the bottom of the bottom car. </p>
<p>Other objects will in part be obvious and in part be pointed out hereinafter. </p>
<p>To the attainment of the aforesaid objects and ends the invention still further resides in the novel details of construction, combination and arrangement of parts, all of which will be first fully described in the following detailed description, and then be particularly pointed out in the appended claims, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which: Fig. 1 is a side elevation of a dredge constructed in keeping with my invention, the parts being positioned with tub and pontoons on the ground and hydraulic jacks energized to start lifting dredge. </p>
<p>Fig. 2 is a front elevation of a portion of the same. Fig. 3 is a side elevation showing the position of the parts with the tub raised and the machine being moved forwardly on stationary pontoons. </p>
<p>Fig. 4 is a front elevation of a portion thereof. Fig. 5 is a side elevation of the machine with the pontoons raised. </p>
<p>Fig. 6 is a front elevation of a portion thereof. </p>
<p>Fig. 7 is a detailed perspective view of the bottom car, portions of the top car being indicated in dotted lines, the swing engine of the top car being shown in full lines. </p>
<p>Fig. 8 is an enlarged detail cross-section on the line 8-8 of Fig. 5. </p>
<p>Fig. 9 is a detailed front elevation showing how the machine accommodates itself to uneven and spotty ground. </p>
<p>Fig. 10 is a detailed cross-section and part elevation, later referred to. </p>
<p>Fig. 11 is a detailed perspective view of a portion of one pontoon and one car mounted on the same. </p>
<p>Fig. 12 is a cross-section on the line 12-12 of Fig. 11. </p>
<p>Fig. 13 is a detailed perspective view, later referred to. </p>
<p>Fig. 14 is a diagrammatic perspective view showing the relation between the hydraulic valvecontrolling cam and its associated parts. Fig. 15 is a diagrammatic view of the hydraulic circuit and the hydraulic pump's motor circuit cooperative with cam 51. </p>
<p>Fig. 16 is a side elevation, showing my invention adapted to use as a tractor for gun-carriages such as heavy ordnance pieces. </p>
<p>Fig. 17 is a detail view of a portion thereof. </p>
<p>In the drawings, in which like numerals of reference indicate like parts in all the figures, I designates the top car of the dredge proper, 2 the boom, 3 the bucket, and 4 the boom and bucket operating cables. </p>
<p>The top car I has a circular bearing base 5, the under side of which is provided with a dolly track 6. </p>
<p>At the rear the top car I carries a vertically adjustable spud pole 7 having a foot 8 joined to it by a ball-and-socket joint 9. The spud pole is raised and lowered by any suitable means under the operator's control, as for example, a cable 10, passed around guides and operated by a drum 1I. </p>
<p>Below the top car I and above a tub 18 is located a bottom car 12, preferably square in plan view and having a top central bearing hole 13 and casting 17, and a bottom hole 16. On top the car 12 has a dolly track 14 between which and dolly track 6 the dolly unit 21 is located. </p>
<p>The tub 18 has a dolly track 19 between which and dolly track 15 on the bottom car the dolly unit 22 is located. </p>
<p>The tub 18 is chambered, as is also the bottom car, and the tub has an apertured boss 20 through which the hollow (tubular) king-pin bolt or shaft 23 passes. This shaft 23 also passes through the bottom car 12 and through the base 5 and bracket casting 26, and carries securing nuts 24 and 25 on its ends, in virtue of which the parts 5, 21, 12, 22 and 18, respectively, are held together. </p>
<p>At each side of the machine is located a pontoon 27 consisting of an elongated foot-plate with turned-up ends 28 and a central block 29 whose upper face 30 is preferably concaved. Sets of upper and lower tracks 31, 32 extend each way from the block 29 to the ends 28, and carriages or trucks 33 run between the pairs of tracks 31-32 and 31-32, the trucks having suitable wheels 34 to run on tracks 32 and beneath tracks 31, the diameters of the wheel treads being only slightly less than the distance between tracks 31-32 to provide clearance. </p>
<p>Hydraulic jacks 35 are carried at each of the four corners of the bottom car 12, and these jacks are connected to the respective trucks 33 by balland-socket joints 36, for a purpose later to appear. </p>
<p>Vertically slotted guide plates 37 have ears 38 to straddle the ends of the blocks 29 to which they are secured by hinge pins 39 (see Figures 10 and 13). </p>
<p>Rotatable within the casting 17 and on the king-pin 23 is a tubular shaft 40 constituting the main operating shaft. This shaft extends from within the top car I to within the bottom car 12 and carries at its upper end the master gear 41 to which operative power is applied from within the top car from any suitable source, in any well known way. </p>
<p>The main shaft 40 also carries driving gears 42 and 43 which mesh respectively with pinions 46 and 47 on the pontoon-operating shafts 44 and 45, respectively. The shafts 44 and 45 are in axial alignment transversely of the machine and turn in the same direction and at the same speed. </p>
<p>These shafts 44 and 45 project through the recessed side walls of the bottom car and carry travel eccentrics 48 having wrist pins 49 that pass through the slots in the slotted guide plates 37. </p>
<p>The peripheries of the eccentrics are formed as convex flanges 50 to ride on the concave surfaces 30 hereinbefore mentioned. </p>
<p>On one of the pontoon-operating shafts, 45, is a control cam 51 that operates a pressure-admitting and switch-operating valve 52 in the hydraulic line and that operates a pressure-release valve 55. </p>
<p>53 designates a suitable tank for the hydraulic fluid (preferably oil), and 54 indicates a hydraulic pump operated by a suitable motor (electric beingshown for illustrative purposes only as any other suitable mechanism may be used to operate the pump). The tank 53 connects with the pump 54 by a duct 59; the pump 54 connects with the valve 52 by duct 60; valve 52 connects by branches ducts 56 to the respective jacks 35, and they in turn connect with valve 55 by a branched duct 57; valve 55 connects with tank 53 by duct 58 (see Fig. 15). A supplemental pressure control valve 70 is connected to duct 60 and by a duct 72 to a pressure equalizing valve 71 that has four outlets 73 one to each jack. The valve 70 is set for a certain predetermined pressure, say 400 tons, 100 tons for each jack. </p>
<p>61 indicates the circuit which energizes the pumps and motor 69 and in which is a normally open circuit closer 62 that is arranged to be operated to close the circuit when valve 52 begins to open and keep the circuit closed while valve 52 remains open (see Fig. 15). </p>
<p>On the bottom car is a circular-segment gear 63 with which a pinion 64 on a shaft 65, carried by the top car, meshes. The shaft 65 is turned by bevel gears 66 and 67 driven by the swing engine 68 under control of the operator. By operating shaft 65 in one direction or the reverse, the top car can be turned on the bottom car, with the king-pin 23 as an axis, to swing the boom 2 laterally, as required in practice. </p>
<p>Operation While the machine is being used to excavate, 60 the tub 18 and pontoons 27 will be in pressurecontact with the ground (see Figs. 1 and 2). </p>
<p>Now when the operator wishes to advance the dredge to another position, he causes power from the main engine (not shown) of the dredge to be applied to the gear 41 to turn the main operating shaft 40 in the required direction, thereby transmitting the proper motion to shafts 44 and 45. This causes the walking cams or travel eccentrics 48 to move from the position of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 to the position of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. </p>
<p>In so moving cam 51 opens valve 52 and sets pump 54 into action, thereby forcing jacks to raise the tub 18 and its superstructure until the tub 18 clears the ground when cam 51 leaves valve 52. Valve 52 immediately closes and causes the pump to stop by allowing its circuit closer 62 to open the circuit. </p>
<p>Continued rotation of shaft 40 moves the machine on the trucks 33 by shaft 40 rotating the bevel gears 42-46 and 43-47, which gears rotate the shafts 44-45. These shafts rotate the eccentrics 48. Wrist pins 49 on eccentrics 48 are thus caused to move up and down in the slots of the plates 37. It should now be plain to see that as eccentrics 48 are turned and pontoons 27 and blocks 29 in pontoons 27 are anchored on the ground, the device moves forwardly or backwardly, as the case may be, depending on which direction shafts 44-45 are rotated. This is particularly so by reason of all the weight of the machine, except that of the pontoons, at this time being held in a raised position by the hydraulic jacks. As shafts 44-45 and the eccentries 48 continue to rotate, their convex ends solidly contact the upper concave surfaces 30 of the blocks 29 in the pontoons 27 and the resistance offered by the now solidly anchored pontoons along with the vertically slotted guide plates 37 that are secured to the blocks 29 by the hinge pins 39, the top car I, bottom car 12 and the tub 18 and their appurtenances are pushed along on the trucks 33 and wheels 34 between tracks 31-32 and 31-32 inside the pon20 toons 27. It is at once obvious, under the stated circumstances, that as the eccentrics 48 move their wrist pins 49 with sufficient force against the sides of the slots in guides 37 in an up and down direction in these guides, the machine cannot but move forwardly or backwardly, as the case may be. This becomes especially true because in the walking position none of the weight of the device is upon the eccentrics 48, the shafts 40, 44 and 45 or wrist pins 49, there then being required, for moving the machine either forwardly or backwardly, only a comparatively slight pushing or pulling force, as the case may be, which is easily exerted by the eccentrics 48. </p>
<p>Continuation of rotation of shaft 40, however, causes eccentric wrist pin 49 to raise the pontoons 27 (telescoping the jacks) to the position shown in Fig. 5 and move the pontoons forwardly, ready for the next move. The raising of the pontoons occurs when pin 49 reaches the end of the slot in 37 (Fig. 13) and lifts 37 which is attached at 39 to blocks 29 of the pontoons 27 (see Fig. 8). The pontoons are then moved forwardly (or backwardly, as the case may be) by 49 pressing against the side of the slot of 37, the tub 18 resting on the ground at this time. </p>
<p>By stopping rotation of the shaft 40 when travel eccentrics are at top position (Fig. 5) and lowering spud pole 7 to cause its foot 8 to ground, the machine resting now on tub 18, the top car will be held stationary, so by turning shaft 65 (and, if found desirable, applying any suitable known type of brake to shaft 44 or 45 to hold the same against accidentally turning and dropping the pontoons prematurely) the operator can C5 turn the bottom car 12 on its axis and hence direct the raised pontoons 27 to one side or the other for the purpose of changing the direction of travel. </p>
<p>When the machine is walking forwardly or backwardly the equalizing valve 71 is cut off by the operator so that the jacks may be operated automatically as a unit by cam 51 controlling valves 52 and 55. But when the machine is stationary and working the equalizing pressure 7, valve is automatically set so that with any sinking or change of elevation of the four corners of the machine the jacks are automatically motivated by the equalizing valve and pressure to keep taut, or take up the developing slack. </p>
<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that the centered spreading of weight permits my apparatus to do what other machines cannot do, to wit: stand on both side pontoons at the same time, the machine to stand on the tub and be operative in that position. The hydraulic jacks at the four corners of the machine are designed to exert pressure enough to hold the machine level at all times, no matter upon what type of terrain or ground the machine is working. </p>
<p>This double use of pontoons and tub makes possible using the machine without building and placing mats for soft ground, boggy places and swampy places, which all previous machines must resort to in their operation or sink so low as to hinder or stop operation altogether. The use of a hollow shaft or king-pin enables me to run electric cables, oil lines, water lines, etc., through the shaft from the tub (where service taps can be made) up to the top of the car. In Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 I have shown the invention adapted as a tractor for gun-carriages such as heavy ordnance. </p>
<p>In these figures 18x is the turn tub, which in this case carries the gear 63x with which the pinion 64x on shaft 65x meshes. Shaft 65x is driven from the swing engine 68x through bevel gears 66x and 67x. The swing engine 68x, gears 66x and 67x, shaft 65x and pinion 64x in this embodiment of the invention are carried by the car 12x on which the ordnance 74 is mounted. The other parts which bear the same reference numerals in Fig. 16 plus the index letter "x", are of the same construction and operate the same way as similarly numbered parts in the preceding figures so a detailed repetition of the description thereof is thought unnecessary. </p>
<p>With this embodiment of the invention wheeled railway trucks 75 adapted to run on rails 76 are provided to receive and be suitably detachably secured to the pontoons 27x so the machine may be pulled along a railroad by an engine or, as shown in the drawings, wheels 80 of the trucks 75 may be driven through sprockets 77 (geared to the wheels 80) and chains 78 from sprockets 79 on car 12x which sprockets 79 are driven, in any suitably controlled and known way, from the main engine of the machine. </p>
<p>In order to permit the gun 74 to be elevated the carriage 12x may have a slot or recess (not shown) below the breech end of the gun, if necessary. </p>
<p>With the gun at rest or being fired it will sit on the pontoons and tub. </p>
<p>When it is desired to transport the gun from one place to a distant point by railroad the machine will be moved to a point up on the railroad by its own mechanism and the railroad trucks be placed under the machine and the machine lowered upon the trucks and then bolted to the trucks, when it is ready to travel once the tub is lifted clear of the ground. The reverse of this action is used to track the machine off the railroad, the first action being to lower the tub on track and removing railroad trucks, when the regular action of the machine in its walking action will take it off the track. Once upon the railroad and bolted to the railroad trucks, the chains 78 are attached if the machine is to travel on the rails by its own power. If it is not to travel by its own power it may be propelled or drawn by other motive power, a gasoline tractor or steam locomotive or other suitable propelling means. </p>
<p>When not on the railroad trucks the machine is caused to travel in the same way as the machine of the preceding figures of the drawings, so a repetition of the description of that operation is thought to be unnecessary here. </p>
<p>In Fig. 17, is shown a means to drive shaft 44x from swing engine 68x. By using lever 82 to shift clutch parts 81 into mesh, shaft 44x will be driven. When shaft 44x is to be driven lever 83 is used to shift gears 67x out of mesh. When 67x is meshed with gears 66x clutch 81 is thrown out and vice versa. </p>
<p>Other advantages of the invention will readily appear to those skilled in the art. </p>
