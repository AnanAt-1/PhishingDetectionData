tens of thousands of web pages without any sexually-explicit content, whether 
graphical or textual. Blocked results include sites operated by educational institutions, 
non-profits, news media, and national and local governments. Among searches on 
sensitive topics such as reproductive health, SafeSearch blocks results in a way 
that seems essentially random; it is difficult to construct a rational non-arbitrary

Internet use increased over the past decade, Internet users have become increasingly 
concerned with unexpected and unintentional exposure to sexually-explicit content. 
Such exposure may result in part from ambiguous or misleading domain names, in 
part from domain names being converted to porn sites after domain expiration (<font size="-2">ref: 
</font><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/edelman/renewals">&quot;Tina's 
Free Live Webcam&quot;</a>), and in part from mistyped domain names (<font size="-2">ref: 
</font><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/edelman/typo-domains">Zuccarini 
typographic variations</a>). </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Whatever 
the causes, Internet pornography has become a sufficiently serious problem to 
prompt three U.S. federal laws (<font size="-2">ref: </font><a href="http://internet.ggu.edu/university_library/if/son_of_cda.html">CDA, 
COPA, CIPA</a>) and numerous U.S. state laws. Some countries, like Saudi Arabia, 
attempt to block Internet pornography at a national level (<font size="-2">ref: 
</font><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia">Documentation 
of Internet Filtering in Saudi Arabia</a>), and private parties have also attempted 
to address the problem through filters to be installed on individual computers 
or on central network infrastructure (<font size="-2">ref: </font><a href="http://www.n2h2.com">N2H2</a> 
and others). Common to these filtering efforts are serious questions of filtering 
accuracy, for filters have been found to prevent access to large bodies of content 
beyond the sexually-explicit materials intended to be blocked (<font size="-2">ref: 
</font><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/edelman/mul-v-us">Sites Blocked 
by Internet Filtering Programs</a>). Filters have therefore faced continued controversy 
and, when mandated by the U.S. government, even constitutional challenges (<font size="-2">ref: 
</font><a href="http://www.ala.org/cipa/">ALA CIPA Archive</a>).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Notwithstanding 
the difficulty of accurate filtering, search engines face pressure to be &quot;family 
friendly&quot; -- making their services more useful to children and to anyone 
who would prefer not to receive unexpected and undesired sexually-explicit content. 
Such filtering by a search engine is conceptually distinct from actual blocking 
by a program like N2H2 -- for while N2H2 and its kin affirmatively deny access 
to designated web sites, Google merely fails to list such sites in its results, 
though the affected sites remain accessible if specifically requested by a knowledgeable 
user. Nonetheless, the practical effect may be similar -- the failure of a user 
to reach, or even know about, certain kinds of content. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Facing 
calls for exclusion of sexually-explicit content from its search results, Google 
in 2000 implemented a feature called SafeSearch, intended to &quot;eliminate ... 
sites that contain pornography and explicit sexual content&quot; (<font size="-2">ref</font>: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/safesearch_help.html">Google Help</a>). Google's 
help site suggests that SafeSearch is primarily driven by automated systems -- 
computer classification of sites that are sexually-explicit versus not, in contrast 
to the human review purportedly used by companies like N2H2 (<font size="-2">ref:</font> 
<a href="http://www.n2h2.com/products/categories.php">N2H2's &quot;Human Review 
Advantage&quot;</a>). For lack of human review of SafeSearch's filtering decisions, 
Google readily admits that its system is not completely accurate. But while a 
number of researchers have previously evaluated the accuracy of client-side and 
network-based filtering, the author knows of no independent investigation of Google's 
SafeSearch filtering. This project seeks to be a first step in such an evaluation 
-- raising issues for further study, discussion, and improvement, and bringing 
into focus the apparent overblocking by SafeSearch of at least tens of thousands 
of pages, and more likely hundreds of thousands or even millions, that do not 
meet SafeSearch's stated filtering criteria.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><a name="results"></a>Affected

searches using the SafeSearch feature. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some 
of the URLs listed in the listings below might be construed as sexually-explicit 
-- for example, for the purpose of providing information about health or sexual 
education, or describing efforts to regulate pornography. However, most of the 
URLs listed seem to be misclassified by Google as sexually explicit. For example, 
it is unlikely that there is sexually-explicit content on thomas.loc.gov (the 
Library of Congress's index of federal legislation), pmo.gov.il (the Israeli Prime 
Minister's Office), nmsa.org (the National Middle School Association), or neu.edu 
(the main index page of Northeastern University), but all four are excluded from 
Google searches using SafeSearch (screenshots: <a href="screenshot-thomas_loc_gov.html">thomas.loc.gov</a>,

results below reflect testing through the ordinary Google site and through Google 
with SafeSearch enabled, conducting searches for approximately 2,500 search terms 
chosen by the author, admittedly in ad hoc fashion. Ordinarily, SafeSearch results 
precisely match regular Google results. However, when SafeSearch blocks a URL 
from reporting in its results, URLs come to be listed in ordinary results that 
are omitted from SafeSearch results. For each search term, this system therefore 
checked for URLs listed in ordinary results but absent from SafeSearch results; 
any such URLs are properly considered omitted from SafeSearch. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
links below report a total of 15,796 distinct URLs found to be omitted from Google 
SafeSearch. In at least some instances, the entire corresponding site is excluded

indicates that Google's SafeSearch fails to block all sexually-explicit content. 
For certain keywords, SafeSearch simply blocks results altogether -- for example,

query for 'playboy'</a> yields the error message &quot;No standard web pages containing

have been blocked. SafeSearch also offers numerous sites with sexually-explicit 
content in response to searches that unambiguously seek such materials, even as 
the majority of sexually-explicit content does seem to be blocked. </font></p></blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><a name="tradeoffs"></a>Possible

author's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/edelman/mul-v-us">prior 
research</a> on Internet filtering (in the context of a <a href="http://www.ala.org/cipa">lawsuit</a> 
challenging Internet filtering in public libraries) indicates a tradeoff between 
overblocking (preventing access to content that does not meet filtering criteria) 
and underblocking (failing to prevent access to content that does meet filtering 
criteria). Research indicates that a given filtering system typically cannot reduce 
its overblocking rate without increasing its rate of underblocking, and vice versa. 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Google's SafeSearch 
system seems to reflect a focus on avoiding underblocking (i.e. avoiding linking 
to sexually-explicit content) at the expense of increased overblocking (omitting 
listings of content that is not sexually-explicit). This focus is borne out in 
Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/safesearch_help.html">SafeSearch documentation</a>, 
which advises of a procedure for requesting that Google exclude a sexually-explicit 
site mistakenly included in SafeSearch results, but which fails to mention any 
procedure for requesting that SafeSearch include a non-explicit site mistakenly 
excluded. Of course, as described in the transparency section below, it is considerably 
more difficult for users to find out what SafeSearch excludes than what it includes 
-- for a SafeSearch user would ordinarily never see those sites that SafeSearch 
excludes. </font></p><blockquote> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Update,

emphasis on avoiding underblocking is also borne out in research, described above, 
as to which sites are blocked and which are not -- i.e. the blocking of the overwhelming 
majority of sexually-explicit content along with a significant amount of non-sexual 
content. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">SafeSearch's 
emphasis on avoiding underblocking, even at the expense of increased overblocking, 
is likely consistent with the stated preferences of those who use SafeSearch. 
However, such users may express this preference without a full understanding of 
the possible scope of overblocking. In future research, the author hopes to survey 
SafeSearch users (or would-be users) to determine their perceptions as to an acceptable 
level of overblocking in exchange for omission of all sexually explicit content.</font></p></blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="trans"></a><img src="screensnap-safesearch.jpg" width="356" height="59" align=right><i>Transparency 
of filtering implementation as to affected users. </i></font></p><blockquote> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When a user enables SafeSearch, 
an additional phrase at the top of every Google results page notes that SafeSearch 
is engaged and active. This transparency is particularly notable because certain 
other filtering systems affirmatively avoid reporting their existence or effect

In this sense, then, Google's SafeSearch is significantly more transparent than 
other filtering systems. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But 
in another sense, Google's SafeSearch is less transparent: While traditional filtering 
systems like <a href="http://www.n2h2.com">N2H2</a> provide error pages when a 
user requests a blocked site, Google SafeSearch simply moves up the next-highest 
ranked site. (If the ordinary number two entry for a given search is blocked, 
then the third site takes position two, four becomes three, and so forth.) A user 
is never notified of this specific invocation of SafeSearch exclusions. A more 
transparent implementation would report the extent of SafeSearch invocation and 
could even offer an immediate option to bypass the filtering (&quot;Three results 
were excluded by SafeSearch. Click here to view the full results.&quot;). </font></p></blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Transparency 
of filtering implementation as to affected sites. </i></font></p><blockquote> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Like commercial Internet

SafeSearch, nor offer such sites any opportunity to dispute SafeSearch classification 
status. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In addition, 
while commercial filtering companies typically offer interested sites the ability

Google offers no such system. Commercial filtering companies' site checkers in 
many ways fall short of content providers' desires -- conducting testing only 
on a URL-by-URL basis, not allowing inspection of the entire block list; failing 
to provide notification of updates or changes; failing to provide a designation 
of the scope, reason, or duration of blocking. But the complete absence of such 
a testing system for SafeSearch leaves affected web sites even worse off than 
under the simple testing systems typically provided by commercial Internet filtering 
companies.</font></p></blockquote>

  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Empirical analysis and 
    comments from Google staff indicate that when Google cannot or fails to retain 
    a cached copy of a web page, SafeSearch will omit that page from its results. 
    Such cache failures can result from at least four distinct factors:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Robots.txt</i>. Some 
    web sites site use a configuration file (&quot;<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html">robots.txt</a>&quot;) 
    to instruct web &quot;bots&quot; (used by search engines) not to visit the 
    site. Under these circumstances, the site may nonetheless remain in ordinary 
    Google listings, but Google will fail to cache it and its pages will therefore 
    disappear from SafeSearch. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
    result is surprising for at least two reasons: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
<blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">First, if a robots.txt 
        file instructs web bots not to visit a site, it is unclear how Google 
        came to index that site in the first place. Google's documentation indicates 
        that the company <a href="http://www.google.com/remove.html#exclude_website">supports</a> 
        and abides by robots.txt, so if a site uses a robots.txt file to exclude 
        systems like Google's, it is unclear why the site would nonetheless remain 
        listed in Google. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Update (4/10/03)</i>: 
          Google staff report that sites with strict robots.txt files may nonetheless 
          remain in Google thanks to references and descriptions in links from 
          other sites and/or in the <a href="http://directory.google.com/">Google 
          Directory</a> / <a href="http://www.dmoz.org">Mozilla Open Directory</a>.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Second, Google's 
        documentation of SafeSearch and its <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">instructions 
        to webmasters</a> lack any mention that certain robots.txt files will 
        cause a site to be omitted from SafeSearch results even as it remains 
        listed in ordinary Google results. Since an affected site remains listed 
        in the ordinary Google search results, its designers are likely to think 
        that there is no problem -- that the site is correctly and fully indexed 
        by Google -- even as the site remains omitted from SafeSearch.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
        </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Other reasons for 
    caching failure.</i> Google staff report that Google may also decline to cache 
    a page or be unable to cache a page when Google fails to crawl that page due 
    to low pagerank, when the page's web server is unreachable, when the page 
    bears a &quot;noindex&quot; instruction in its meta tags, when the page is 
    of 0 bytes in length, or when it redirects users to another page or site. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To assess the rate at 
    which caching failures cause omissions from SafeSearch, the author determined 
    which of the web pages listed above are included in Google's cache. Of the 
    URLs listed, approximately 26.7% were not included in Google's cache. These 
    URLs are designated in web page result listings with wording &quot;Site may 
    be omitted due to caching failure by Google, redirect, or 0-byte response.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">SafeSearch's requirement 
    of cached copies of the pages at issue likely results from SafeSearch's need 
    to analyze content on that site in order to determine, to the best of its 
    ability, whether the site should be blocked by SafeSearch. But this requirement 
    is both undocumented and unrelated to the reason why users rely on SafeSearch. 
    Because users typically depend on SafeSearch for accurate and comprehensive 
    results, web pages are listed in the results linked above even if their omission 
    from SafeSearch results from, for example, a robots.txt configuration rather 
    than from other errors made by SafeSearch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><a name="config-levels"></a>Scope

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Analysis in this project

who do not specifically request an alternative. However, enabling this &quot;moderate 
filtering ... images only&quot; mode had no apparent effect even on searches for 
sexually-explicit content. For example, the top ten results for &quot;playboy&quot; 
were identical, and included a numerous sites with extensive sexually-explicit 
images, whether SafeSearch was disabled or was set to &quot;moderate&quot; (see 
<a href="screenshot-playboy_nomed.html">screenshot</a>).</font></p></blockquote><p><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"><a name="scope-omissions"></a>Scope

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">When a result is omitted 
from Google SafeSearch, the omission sometimes reflects omission of the entire 
domain name hosting that result, as if SafeSearch had deemed all content on that 
host to be pornographic. In other instances, omission reflects apparent targeting 
of a specific page, while other pages on its web host remain listed in SafeSearch 
and sometimes even in the search results at issue. When SafeSearch mistakenly 
omits a page from a given host but includes other results from that host, the 
omission is in a certain sense less serious -- for an interested user might click 
through the other results and thereby reach the page wrongly omitted. However, 
the initial exclusion nonetheless reduces the quality of results provided to the 
user -- denying the user direct access to the result that the ordinary Google 
considered most relevant to the search at issue.</FONT></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><a name="concl"></a>Conclusions</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i></i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Google

Help</a>). But in making SafeSearch available to the public, with the knowledge 
that many thousands of Internet users will rely on it day in and day out, Google 
puts its name and reputation behind this specific implementation of content filtering. 
Given Google's large market share among search engines, its perceived leadership 
position, and its vague statements to date as to the specific methods used and 
the specific level of accuracy sought or achieved, evaluation of the accuracy 
of SafeSearch seems particularly desirable. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Initial 
research indicates cause for concern via the omission from SafeSearch of substantial 
bodies of valuable web content -- such that ordinary Internet users relying on 
SafeSearch will systematically miss relevant web sites due to SafeSearch's errors. 
Further research will attempt to better quantify the scope of these errors. For 
example, future research might compare SafeSearch's erroneous omissions to the 
rate at which sites unreachable due to random network-level or server-level failures. 
Research might also compare the frequency of SafeSearch's errors to the rate of 
overblocking by commercial blocking programs or to the proportion of content filtered 
by countries that seek to limit Internet access. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some 
omissions from SafeSearch may result from unanticipated and undocumented interaction 
between Google's policies and web publishers' configurations (i.e. robots.txt). 
Additional documentation by Google may help address these problems. Google might 
inform users in greater detail as to the level of accuracy they can expect from 
SafeSearch and as to the kinds of omissions likely to be made by SafeSearch. Google 
might also inform webmasters as to steps they can take to assist with the proper 
categorization of their content.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">SafeSearch's
