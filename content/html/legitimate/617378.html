    <br>
    THE ORIGINS OF THE DANIELSON FAMILY<br>
    <br>
    By Marcella Pasay<br>
    <br>
    Reading early histories of the area one may be led to believe that James Danielson 
    arrived in Connecticut almost directly from Scotland. Some texts refer to 
    his being "of New Shoreham" (now Block Island, RI) at the time he buys land 
    in Pomfret in 1706. Where did he come from? In RI Genealogies, in the chapter 
    entitled "Early Block Island Families, we read:<br>
    <br>
    "Some of the first proprietors in Dorchester and Braintree did not go to Block 
    Island in person but sent agents and factors, among them several of the Scots 
    from the Braintree iron works, who left numerous descendants on the island. 
    Among these may be mentioned William Tosh (McIntosh, Duncan Ross alias Tormut 
    Rose, Alexander Enos (Innis), Duncan McWilliamson, Robert Guttridge, James 
    Danielson, and others."<br>
    <br>
    What was James Danielson’s connection with the Braintree iron works? Established 
    in the mid-seventeenth century on the Saugus River, the iron works recruited 
    "…skilled and unskilled…free and indentured…" workers. Among the indentured 
    were a number of Scots prisoners taken at the Battles of Preston and Dunbar 
    and Worcester. Was James Danielson, namesake of the Borough, a Scots prisoner? 
    No. James was born in 1648/1649. These battles took place within a few years 
    after his birth. Searching the New Shoreham records, however, we read:<br>
    <br>
    "James Danelson Juner his Marke being the marke…."<br>
    <br>
    It was, in fact, his father, James, who first arrived in New England, probably 
    not as a prisoner, but as a skilled worker from Scotland. Prisoners were not 
    allowed to bring their families and were not paid much. According to the New 
    England Genealogical Register (vol. 6, p. 250) and the Essex Quarterly Court 
    Files, a James Danielson resided in Braintree and gave a deposition in 1653. 
    It states he was twenty years old but he was most likely older. (If James, 
    Jr., was born in 1648 his father would only have been fifteen years old in 
    1653.)<br>
    <br>
    There are no further records of this first James, his wife, or what happened 
    to them. It may be that when his work was completed he returned to Scotland 
    and left his son as an apprentice in Braintree. James, Jr., must have been 
    a trusted employee and exhibited good business sense to be selected as an 
    agent for the New Shoreham enterprise. He must also have had some capital 
    of his own in order to begin his land purchases.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    James did very well on the island buying and selling property and building 
    a cattle herd. He married twice and each wife bore him a son. When he arrived 
    in Connecticut James and Samuel accompanied he and his wife, Mary.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    At least one historical account mentions a son, William, but there is no record 
    of his birth or death and he is not mentioned in his father’s will. There 
    is a William Danielson in the Pomfret land records but the property does not 
    seem to be in any way adjoining or part of the Danielson property. There are 
    no land transactions recorded between the aforementioned William and the other 
    Danielsons. The surname of William may well be a corruption of Dennison as 
    the early text is not clear. Until other records are found, we must exclude 
    this William from the family of James.</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Danielson/Donaldson Descendant Register, <br>
Generation No. 1</b><br><br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><div align="Left"><br><b>1</b>. <b>James DANIELSON</b> was born ABT 1648 in Aryshire, Scotland, and died 22 JAN 1728 <br>
in Killingly, Windham, Ct.. He was buried in Killingly, Conn.. He married Hannah <br>
GEORGE (ROSE) 11 MAR 1685 in Block Island, RI, daughter of Peter GEORGE and Mary <br>
ROWNING. She was born 7 SEP 1648 in Braintree, Ma, and died 1693 in New Shorehan, <br>
RI. He married Abigail ? ? in Unknown, possibly Scotland. He married Mary TOSH 22 <br>
JAN 1700. She was born 1666, and died 23 FEB 1752 in Killingly, Conn..  <br><br>
Note: Buried in the cemetary he gave the town. <br>
Note: James Danielson was on the roster of the Saugus Iron Works in 1653. He died <br>
in 1728 in Killingly, Ct. The epitaph onhis tomb stone says he died in the 80th <br>
year of his life so that makes his birth date abt. 1648. The battles that hewas <br>
suppose to be captured at and sent to this county as a prisoner took place in 1650 <br>
and 1653 so there no way hecould have been sent as a prisoner. He gave a deposition <br>
while at the iron works in 1653 which stated that he was 20years old. That would <br>
have made his birth date 1633 in Scotland.David P. Wilson, researcher of Ct. <br>
genealogy found a book of Rhode Island records in the library at ECSU, that listed <br>
James Danielson being made a free man May 5, 1696. Since James Jr. was born 5/15/ <br>
1687 he would have been 9 years oldso this was apparently James Sr..The info from<br>
 my mothers 30 year research into her family reflects the following:James Danielson <br>
was resident of Ayrshire, Scotland. He settled at Block Island in May 1683. <br>
The reason for the move toAmerica has been explained by being a prisoner in S<br>
cotland of a war with England and being sold or forced to immigrateas an identured <br>
servant for 10 years at an iron works on Block Island. The iron works. went out of <br>
business and hebecame a free man. This info came from Helen Winslow Mansfield, <br>
historian at Block Island in letters dated in 1952.The other explaination is that <br>
he came of his free will to work for the iron works. Which ever was true, he became <br>
an important and influential citizen with much land on the island before selling and <br>
moving to Killingly, Conn. Therecords we have shows land purchases of 170 acres on <br>
the island between 1686 and 1696.He sold 124 acres of land and a mansion house on <br>
the island to Thomas Mitchell for 545 pounds. He already lived inConn. at that time. <br>
We do not know when he moved to Conn. but they still bought Block Island property <br>
in 1704 andstarted selling it in 1705.If the arrival date is correct, he would have <br>
been about 35 years old and two years later he married Hannah George Rose(widow of <br>
Tormut Rose) on 3/11/1685. She died abt 1693 in New Shoreham, RI.He then remarried <br>
Mary Tosh (MacIntosh) at New Shoreham, RI (Block Island) 1/22/1700.He had three <br>
children, James B. , John B., Samuel B.The Killingly, Conn. Donaldsons ( Danielsons) <br>
are descended from Samuel.Anita Leon, of NYC, now deceased , was a family historian. <br>
In a letter to my mother, Harriet H. Donaldson, she saidthat James 1st wife was <br>
Abilgail by who he had a son, John. There is no record of a wife Abigail on BI and <br>
no record ofthe date of birth for John on BI. My mother speculated that John was <br>
born in Scotland and his mother Abigail diedthere. This would explain the missing <br>
info on BI.There is more info about property purchases, etc. but to much to list <br>
here. Send Email for more info if interested.He is buried at the Old Westfield <br>
Cemetery which is the cemetery he gave to the community.<br>

daughter of Thomas MIGHALL and Abigail MACLAFLIN. She was born 1712 in Killingly, <br>
Conn..  <br><br>
 Note: John received the 39th grant of land in Brimfield Ma.. He had an original <br>
grant of 120 acres awarded 12/31/1701. Itwas reaffirmed 6/18/1731John was suppose <br>
to be an accomplished musician and singer. He could sing all day and never repeat <br>
the same song. Hewas a weaver by trade. He also took part in some of the indian <br>
battles.He and his wife, Margaret Mighill apparently moved from Killingly, Ct. <br>
to Brimfield, Ma. about the time they weremarried in 1727. They had 6 children, <br>
of which Timothy was a General in the Revolutionary War. Oldest son John, Jr. was <br>
born in Brimfield in Dec. 1727.They lived in the Danielson Hill School District <br>
and were very prominent in the early history of the town, his nameoften appearing <br>
in the church records.In 1736 he subscribed 47 acres of land for the settlement <br>
of a minister. His house stood in an orchard 30 or 40 rodsnorth of Deacon Paiges. <br>
In 1725 James transfered the original land grant in Killingly, Ct. to son Samuel. <br>
In 1727 he deeded the homestead toson Samuel. John was a witness to the <br>
transaction. In 1728 James made a will naming Samuel, son James and grandson <br>
James. Apparently all the property was transfered to Samuel and thus was not a <br>
part of the will. John was not mentionedin the will. It is not known if James <br>
made a cash settlement to John before John moved to Brimfield, Conn. Or if infact <br>
John was not really James son.There is a real question about if John is the son <br>
of James. According to many of the web sites John was born in Alloa,Scotland abt. <br>
1670 that would have made James 23 years old. Family word of mouth history is that <br>
James was marriedfirst to Abigail but as far as we can prove, Johns 1st marriage <br>
was to Margaret Mighill 3/23/1727 which would have madeJohn 57 years old at the <br>
time. They had 6 children, the last being born in 1741 which would have made John <br>
70 yearsold. Its certainly possible but the odds are against it.Additional <br>
information from the Brimfield, Ma. Web site says John was originally given his <br>
grant of land in Brimfieldin 1701 but Brimfield did not develop quickly so the <br>
land grants were reaffirmed in 1731. So if John was born in 1705as some of the <br>
web sites state, how did he get a grant of land 4 years before he was born?Other <br>
genealogy sites list John as being born about 1705, but there is no record of <br>
his birth, even though both Jamesand Samuel's births are recorded on Block Island, <br>
RI. Harriet Hathaway Donaldson's word of mouth family history indicates that James <br>
1s wifes name was Abigail and John wasborn to them in Scotland before they immigrated <br>
to America. But there is no supporting documentation to support that atthis time. <br>
That would explain why Johns birth is not recorded but its pure speculation.<br>

          <p>Hello there! I have just come across your Danielson Family tree information 
            as I was searching the web. My husband, Rich, is the grandson of Ray 
            Guernsey Beebe. This was a great find for us since we have very little 
            information about his family tree. Ray died when tony was in the service 
            in Belgium and he talked very little about his Dad. His Mother, Kate 
            Bressler Beebe, was a very lovely person and raised Tony to be a very 
            good Father-in law- to me. We loved him dearly. He was the editor 
            of The Journal-News in Spencerville, OH, (a small town newspaper) 
            until his death in 1992. After he died Rich took over the family business. 
          </p>
          <p>Many thanks for the information you put on the web! </p>
