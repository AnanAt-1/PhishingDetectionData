When participation is shown as 0%, or other information is missing in our display, it&#39;s most likely because this school either did not offer Algebra 1 to its 8th grade students. It may also be that the missing data was not included in the federal Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). (See &quot;Sources&quot; for more information.) Note&amp;colon; While schools can offer Algebra 1 in 7th or 8th grades, we are displaying 8th grade Algebra 1 participation and pass rate information only, because the CRDC data set did not include pass rate information for 7th grade students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did you find the information about advanced STEM courses useful?
