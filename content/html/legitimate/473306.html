<p>The Balkan Peninsula is as of a unique region as you may think. It is the best that Eastern Europe has to offer in terms of places to visit, friendly behaviour, and more. However, this region is often overlooked by people who are looking to visit the more popular tourist destinations across Europe and the world. </p>
<p>With that being said, we wanted to list a few reasons why you should put the Balkans on your checklist and visit the countries located in this region. We promise that you will have the most unique and entertaining experience, so without any further ado, let’s start diving into the details. </p>
<h2>Friendly People and Tasty Dishes</h2>
<p>First of all, all Balkan countries are known for their hospitality. Whichever country you decide to visit, you will be welcomed warmly and you will be pleased to hear that the people here are extremely friendly. They will treat you like you&#8217;re their family member and will answer all questions if you have any. </p>
<p>Not only that, but you will be pleased to know that the region has plenty of unique and tasty dishes. The Balkans is known for its unique cuisine, which is shared by many of the countries. Some culinary delights that you are ought to try are sarma, moussaka, ajvar, kebab, stuffed peppers, pleskavica, shopska salad, and most importantly – bread. Balkan people are obsessed with bread and their bakeries make the most delicious bread that you will ever taste. </p>
<p>Find the time to try all of them as we promise you that they are unlike anything you’ve ever tasted in your life and you will be surprised as to how good they are. </p>
<h2>The Balkans is Cheap</h2>
<p>Next up, when you visit many of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, especially those that are located in Europe, you will be surprised to know that they are pretty expensive. Take Paris and Barcelona as an example. Since they are among the most visited cities in the world, everyday expenses and accommodation can cost a fortune. </p>
<p>That is not the case with the Balkan. All of the countries are relatively cheap here. That includes food and beverage, public transportation and accommodation. Yes, it’s a given that Croatia and Slovenia might be a bit more expensive than the rest of the countries in the region, but compared to the rest of Europe, the Balkans is literally a financial haven for those who are looking to travel on a budget. </p>
<h2>Plenty of Places to Visit</h2>
<p>Apart from the fact that the cheap nature of the Balkans is of massive importance to your wallet, that also allows you to visit many of the region’s best destinations. And trust us when we say this – there are plenty of them that you should consider. </p>
<p>Let’s start with Slovenia. Lake Bled, Ljubljana Piran, Maribor, Kranjska Gora and Triglav National Park are just a few honourable mentions. Croatia is known for its lucrative shoreside that includes many great cities such as Porec and Dubrovnik. But you will also be pleased to know that there are many other fantastic places to visit here, including Plitvice National Park, the country’s capital, Zagreb, Split, Zadar and Rovinj. </p>
<p>Moving down to the south, we have Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some of the must-visit places here are Sarajevo, Mostar, the Battle of Sutjeska monument, Jajce and Una National Park. Montenegro includes various beauties such as Herceg Novi, Kotor, Podgorica and Budva, which is one of the most popular tourist destinations for young people. </p>
<p>Serbia includes tons of attractions including Kalemegdan and the St. Sava church, which are located in the capital, Belgrade. Then, we have House on the Drina, the Studenica monastery, Skull Tower, Devil’s Town Varos and Uvac Canyon. </p>
<p>The final country on the map is North Macedonia, a small nation, yet full of wonders. It hides massive attractions as Ohrid and Ohrid Lake, Matka Canyon, Krusevo, the ancient cities of Heraclea and Scupi, Prespa Lake, Mavrovo, Galicica, Sar Planina, as well as the capital of the country – Skopje. </p>
<h2>Unique Culture</h2>
<p>The culture in the Balkans is quite unique and unlike anything you&#8217;ve ever come across. People here are just looking for an excuse to celebrate for stuff and go out. They mostly do that in their so-called &#8220;kafani” where we must warn you that you shouldn’t get too confident with the most popular beverage in the region – rakija. </p>
<p>These restaurants are definitely places that you should visit as they are a true embodiment of the culture in the Balkan Peninsula. </p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As you can see, the Balkan is packed with wonders that are just waiting to be unravelled by you. Regardless of whether you are planning to visit this place during the summer or winter, you will not fall short as there are countless places to visit and things to do. The best part about it is that the whole trip will be extremely budget-friendly. </p>

<p>he Balkans is definitely a hidden jewel for tourists as there are tons of great places to visit, things to see, and dishes to try out. Yes, many people who are looking to travel the world opt-out for more “commercial tourist attractions” and that is the reason why the beauties of the Balkan Peninsula often slip under the radar.  </p>
<p>With that being said, we are going to take a look at Balkan treasure that the residents in the region are well-aware of, but it still remains relatively unknown to the world – North Macedonia. There are plenty of wonders that this ancient country hides and we will be more than happy to list a few. Who knows, maybe they’ll spark your adventure and you will go and visit them. Let’s check them out. </p>
<h2>Matka Canyon</h2>
<p>The first of the many wonders of North Macedonia is Matka Canyon, located just outside of the country’s capital, Skopje. This place is home to a few medieval monasteries and its lake, Matka Lake, is the oldest artificial lake in North Macedonia. </p>
<p>Apart from the breathtaking views, great walking trail and the cosy restaurant, Matka Cave is also home to Vrelo Cave, a cave that many divers have explored throughout the years, but never managed to find its bottom. It was recently confirmed that Vrelo is the deepest cave in Europe, while some believe that it has the potential to be the deepest in the world. </p>
<p>Apart from exploring Vrelo Cave, kayaking in the canyon and enjoying the view from the restaurant, Matka is also a popular hiking destination, with the most popular trail being Matka-Vodno, which is around 13 kilometres. </p>
<h2>The Ohrid Lake/ Ohrid</h2>
<p>Our next listing is the biggest jewel and the most popular tourist destination – Ohrid Lake. Located in Ohrid, the lake is one of the deepest lakes in the world and the deepest in the Balkans. North Macedonia’s side of Lake Ohrid has been declared a national heritage site by UNESCO. NASA even named one of the lakes of Titan, Saturn, after it. </p>
<p>There are virtually countless things to do here aside from enjoying the fantastic views. Ohrid and the Ohrid Lake are the perfect summer destinations. Apart from enjoying a cruise on the lake, you can visit Varosh, the city’s old town, where you can sightsee many of its churches, including St. Sophia, St. John the Theologian and Church of Saints Clement and Panteleimon, as well as Samoil’s Fortress, the Ancient Theatre, and more. </p>
<p>The other side of the city is home to its fantastic beaches and other popular destinations like The Bay of the Bones, Ljubanista, St. Naum and the small village of Trpejca. If you happen to visit Trpejca, make sure to try the fish delicacies there. </p>
<p>Finally, if you are more of the adventurous type, you can always go to the Galicica National Park and take a guided hiking tour around the mountain or climb many of its peaks, including Magaro and Lako Signoj. </p>
<h2>Peshna Cave</h2>
<p>Have you ever watched Lord of the Rings? This is such a legendary movie franchise that we are just going to assume that you did. Well, Peshna Cave has been described as identical to Lord of the Rings’ imaginary caves by the NY Times. </p>
<p>It is located just a few kilometres away from Makedonski Brod and its opening is the largest in the Balkans. It is over 120 metres long and it is home to many several endemic species that are living in the cave&#8217;s underground lakes. Considering the fact that its opening is massive, sun rays beam light to the vary end of the cave, making it easy for you to explore it. </p>
<h2>Other Honourable Mentions</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s no denying the fact that North Macedonia is packed with hidden wonders that you must visit if you are planning a trip there. Apart from the aforementioned attractions, there are numerous other places that you can include on your trip. Some honourable mentions include Mavrovo, which is home to the country’s most popular ski resort and national park, as well as its capital, Skopje. </p>
<p>Although Skopje is the business centre of the country, you can explore quite a few places there, including Vodno, the city’s old bazaar and visit its numerous museums. Then, we have Krusevo, which is the home of the country’s most popular singer in history, Tose Proeski, as well as to one of the most endemic buildings that you will come across in your life – the Makedonium.</p>
<p>Heraclea, the ancient city in Bitola, Radozda and Galichnik should be on your list if you have the time. The best part about travelling to Macedonia is the fact that the expenses are pretty low, making it the perfect budget-friendly destination that you can go to with your friends and/or loved ones. </p>

								<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
						<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-46 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/controller-274x300.png" alt="Controller" width="274" height="300" srcset="https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/controller-274x300.png 274w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/controller.png 584w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" />When most Englishmen, or Westerners in general, are talking about the Balkans, they usually imagine small country-states not unlike North Korea – no access to technology, culture stuck in the 80s, people are poor and miserable, no food, etc. While Slovakia technically isn’t part of the Balkans, I do believe that the scene where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYqY5YELd0" target="_blank">the American students visit Bratislava</a> from the 2004 film “Eurotrip” is a pretty great representation of what Westerners believe the Balkans are like. I mean, it’s not really that hard to imagine – many Balkan countries used to be Soviet states before the Soviet Union went the way of the dodo, and we all know that communism wasn’t exactly friendly to new technology or foreign influences. Still, that was over 20 years ago, and today the Balkans are about as technologically advanced as the rest of the world. They’ve caught up pretty well, and in some ways they’ve actually surpassed the West. For example, the monthly fee for an Internet connection in Bulgaria is WAY cheaper than it is in England – like, there’s not even a comparison! When my wife and I are living in Bulgaria, we pay about £5-6 a month for 100 Mbit unlimited Internet, which would cost a LOT more in the UK.</p>
<p>But the most interesting aspects I’d love to explore are, of course, cultural rather than technological. And let me tell you, the way people play videogames on the Balkans is pretty different from the way they do it in the West! In the West, there’s typically three kinds of gamers. The first kinds are what are commonly referred to as the hardcores. They own several videogame consoles (PS4, Xbox One, etc), as well as a powerful computer, and play a wide variety of videogames across many different genres. Then there’s the dedicated fanbases, which mostly play just one game or franchise. In America, a very common stereotype is the gamer who plays nothing but “Call of Duty” and “Madden” every year. And then there’s the casual gamer, the people who don’t really identify as gamers, but like to play things like “Candy Crush Saga” or “Threes” on their phones every once in a while. In the West, casual gamers and hardcore gamers have an almost 50/50 split. There’s almost no in-between, and the dedicated fans who only play 1 or 2 franchises very often transition into being hardcores pretty quickly. That’s because, in the West, during the 80s and 90s videogames were a really big part of the culture, and thus many grew up with them and developed a healthy interest in them. If you’ve been playing games all your childhood, chances are you’ll continue as an adult, too. Meanwhile, many people who haven’t played games as a child are able to discover them very easily through their mobile phones, thus becoming casual gamers.</p>
<p>However, on the Balkans, the videogame market wasn’t nearly as popular in the 80s and 90s, because as I already mentioned the Soviet Union wasn’t too fond of foreign inventions. As a matter of fact, most – if not all – Balkan countries NEVER got official releases of videogame systems such as the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Mega Drive, and instead people who wanted to play those games had to rely on illegal copycats that began circulating in the mid-90s. Throughout the 2000s, as access to the Internet began spreading, more and more people discovered gaming and gradually turned into hardcores, and during the 2010s many began experimenting with casual gaming as well. But both numbers absolutely dwindle when compared to the amount of dedicated gamers on the Balkans. And the gamers who only play one or two games here don’t play things such as “Call of Duty” or “Madden” – they focus on cheap (or even free) multiplayer-only titles such as “DotA 2”, “League of Legends” and “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive”. The solution for that is simple – they’re social experiences, and a fun way to connect with other people. Many don’t really consider them as games. In the eyes of most dedicated gamers, a night spent in a PC club playing “League of Legends” with good friends is just like a night spent partying, or hanging out. It’s a fascinating cultural difference.</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t really talk about games without mentioning online gambling. The thing is, many Balkan countries don’t really have their own online casinos – the most they have are online betting and poker sites, and some countries don’t even have that. Instead, if citizens of the Balkan nations want to play online casino games, they often need to resort to visiting the foreign best casino sites <a href="https://www.bestcasinosites.net/" target="_blank">here</a>, looking for ones that accept non-native players. I believe that the lack of local online casinos is the reason why gambling in general isn’t as popular around here as it is in the UK. Another fascinating cultural difference!</p>

						<p>When our kids were little, we used to play a lot of board games. Because we moved around so much, we took a little bit of each place we lived at with us and left a part of our hearts there as well. That meant we had to stick together as a family and nurture our British identity. We couldn&#8217;t rely on watching TV programmes with the little ones, either. Watching TV didn&#8217;t provide the necessary feeling of togetherness, as British TV programmes on the Balkans in the early- to mid-90s were hardly available. TV channels were not much better than what they had been in the 80s. And those had been ghastly.</p>
<p>Can you imagine turning on your TV to find a live broadcast of a lengthy civil war trial, followed by a public execution where you see the bodies of the dictator and his wife collapse under fire? All that as you and your family watch speechless.</p>
<p>It might sound like a scene from a horror movie but that&#8217;s exactly what happened on December 25, 1989, when Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena Ceaușescu were captured, tried and convicted by a military tribunal on charges of genocide and sabotage. The trial by a kangaroo court lasted approximately an hour and was later criticised by many democratic countries for being illegal. Moreover, the Ceaușescu execution was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/century/1980-1989/Story/0,,110504,00.html" target="_blank">broadcast live on public television</a> in many countries from the Communist Bloc.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was just to paint you an accurate picture of what TV shows were like on the Balkans in the 90s. It was the time of the Yugoslav wars and though we seemed to luckily not be at the wrong place at the wrong time and somehow never lived in an active war zone, our family <em>was</em> affected.</p>
<p>So, board games and puzzles were our escape from reality and our safe space. I remember this small roulette set we had. We brought it back from England and started playing it. The kids were ecstatic. They&#8217;d fight over who&#8217;d be the bank. We would play for hours. And that was how the kids got to know English money, too.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-40 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/roulette-set-300x151.jpg" alt="Roulette Set - Playing Roulette at Home" width="300" height="151" srcset="https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/roulette-set-300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/roulette-set.jpg 708w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I cherished the time spent with the kids. A couple of months ago, I was talking to my son – he&#8217;s exploring Asia the way I did with the Balkans back in the 90s. I told him I missed our playing roulette. I said we should get together and play some soon, realising how unlikely to happen that was. But he surprised me by reminding me there&#8217;re cool online casinos – &#8220;We&#8217;ll all sign up, pick a table and a time to play and we&#8217;ll meet online. It&#8217;ll be like the old times.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remembered that a few months earlier, when I finally succumbed to buying a smartphone and stepped into the 21 century, my daughter sent me a helpful article offering the <a href="https://www.mobileonlinecasinos.co.uk/roulette/" target="_blank">most comprehensive review of mobile roulette games</a>. I forwarded that to my son and we decided on a game we could all play. It wasn&#8217;t like it used to be but, after all, nothing is – we&#8217;re older, the kids – all grown up, and the world of technology is brimming with possibilities.</p>

						<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-35 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/paypal-earnings-300x169.png" alt="Paypal Earnings" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/paypal-earnings-300x169.png 300w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/paypal-earnings-768x432.png 768w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/paypal-earnings-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/paypal-earnings.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In the US and Western Europe, e-wallet service <a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal</a> is immensely popular and used daily by most people. For those of you who are unaware of its purpose, PayPal is basically a quick, easy and secure way to send or hold money. For example, you can connect a bank account or a debit card to it, and then use PayPal to pay for stuff online without having to input your information every single time. As you know, many sites request your credit card number, your full name, your security number, your billing address, your postal code, your mother’s maiden name, your childhood pet’s name, the name of that girl you had a crush on in fifth grade, but were too embarrassed to tell her even though she was always super nice to you and probably would’ve said yes, but then you had to switch schools and next time you met her she was dating a complete douchebag… You get the drill. The point I was trying to make is that this is a lot of information to input every single time, and besides, if just one of the sites you shop from gets hacked, all of that information leaks out and you’ve got people with access to your credit cards.</p>
<p>PayPal, on the other hand, eliminates both the hassle of having to input all of that info over and over again (all you need to do to pay with PayPal is to enter your username and password) and removes the risk of a potential leak since, well, PayPal has never been hacked before. Like, ever. So if a site you shop at ever does get hacked, the most the hackers will ever get from you will be your e-mail, with the rest of the information kept safely within PayPal’s secure servers. And if that wasn’t enough, you could also just store money in there and pay through PayPal without having a credit card or a bank account at all – if someone sends you money, you can hold it in there forever (hence the e-wallet moniker). That’s awesome, right? It’s no wonder people in the West are using it all the time! But, surprisingly, in the Balkans things aren’t nearly as rosy.</p>
<p>First of all, not a whole lot of people use PayPal in the first place. In the Balkans, the common consensus is that services which store your credit card information (or even worse, your bank account) are fraudulent, and even though that couldn’t be further from the truth, most people from the region refuse to use them. As a result, many services and online shops don’t provide the service, even if they do in other regions. A few good examples are the PlayStation Store and Google Play, which accept payments through PayPal in the West, but deny this option to Balkan nations. Additionally, while <a href="https://www.ponlinecasinos.co.uk/" target="_blank">most UK Casino Sites accept deposits via PayPal</a>, most online casinos in the Balkans don’t really provide that opportunity and still require credit cards, which, combined with the aforementioned mistrust for sites that store this kind of information, may be why online casinos aren’t as popular here as they are in, say, the UK.</p>
<p>Of course, just because a lot of people don’t use PayPal doesn’t mean no one does. Many more tech-savvy people have PayPal accounts for ease of payments, and similarly, a lot of websites do offer the opportunity to pay with PayPal to the few customers who prefer that method. So things are gradually getting better – here’s hoping they’ll keep improving for us PayPal lovers!</p>

						<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about the Balkans is that they are this place of like-minded people, who look the same, speak the same language and have the same religious beliefs. In reality, this couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The abstract concept of the Balkans encompasses countries, which though having shared history, have very different opinions about it. Apart from history, the Balkan peoples disagree on many other topics mostly because they do share the characteristic of being passionate. No matter what they&#8217;re discussing, they are passionate about it.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-32 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moussaka-with-potatoes-300x175.jpg" alt="Moussaka with Potatoes" width="300" height="175" srcset="https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moussaka-with-potatoes-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/moussaka-with-potatoes.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />They pride on their ethnic cuisine and they&#8217;d probably think I&#8217;m picking a quarrel if they heard me say that they have a dish that&#8217;s common for them all but, truth be told, they do – it&#8217;s called moussaka. Well, I can&#8217;t guarantee all Balkan states have it but most of them surely have their own version of moussaka.</p>
<p>Originally coming from Greece, the mousakás (μουσακάς) is a traditional dish which is most notable for being layered. In Greece, the three layers of what is going to become moussaka are cooked separately and only combined for the final stage of cooking – baking. But as much as layers are important, their ingredients matter, too.</p>
<p>In Greece, they&#8217;d serve you a dish of sautéed aubergines and tomatoes and usually minced meat, topped with Béchamel sauce. But in other Balkan countries, if you ordered moussaka expecting that you&#8217;d be in for surprise. Though the dish may look very similar, it&#8217;d be likely made without aubergines. Instead of the key-ingredient of the Greek moussaka, some Balkan nations use potatoes. They also replace the Béchamel sauce with plain white yogurt with beaten eggs. They often sprinkle grated cheese on top and garnish the dish with flat-leaf parsley. To try the potato-based moussaka, visit Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia or Slovenia. If you&#8217;d like to try moussaka with onions, green peppers, carrots or courgettes, order moussaka in Turkey.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget the moussaka Kate and I ate on one of our trips to the Black Sea coast. We stopped at a village in the foot of the Balkan Mountains and had the typical Bulgarian moussaka with &#8220;tarator&#8221; – a cold soup made from cucumbers, yogurt, dill, and walnuts. Check out this <a href=" https://youtu.be/XhbWHWl_9cc" target="_blank">lovely video recipe</a> for the Bulgarian variant of moussaka.</p>
<p>Many people think of moussaka as a Greek dish but there&#8217;s a very similar dish in Egypt and in the Middle East. Anyway, let the Greeks and everybody else in the Balkans enjoy this awesome and nutritious meal with ouzo and Greek salad, also known as Shopska salad in Bulgaria, Serbian salad in Serbia or Çoban salatası (Shepherd&#8217;s salad) in Turkey.</p>
<p>Talking of the Greeks, did you know that the ancients were very keen on gambling? They supposedly used to bet on major sporting events, including the Olympics. There were gambling houses in Ancient Greece and they even had a goddess of fortune and prosperity – Tyche, the daughter of Aphrodite and Zeus.</p>

						<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-28 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/map-of-the-balkans.jpg" alt="Map of the Balkans" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/map-of-the-balkans.jpg 700w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/map-of-the-balkans-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />If you don&#8217;t know someone and are quick to label them negatively, are they to blame? Certainly not. Actually, if there is any fault in this situation, it should most probably lie with the one that&#8217;s reluctant to come to know the other, yet quick to judge them. If all this sounds like a bunch of gibberish to you, let me give you an example.</p>
<p>In January 2013, the British press had a very strange urge to present the UK public with a New Year&#8217;s gift of half-truths concerning the two latest additions to the European Union – Romania and Bulgaria. The sad example of scaremongering put many of us on edge with the prospect of the allegedly uneducated, arrogant Bulgarians and Romanians flooding the UK labour market and claiming income-related benefits.</p>
<p>A year later, there were quite a number of articles that updated the Brits on the news that only a small portion of the number of expected immigrants have actually arrived on the British Isles and, more importantly, the number has not really changed after the transitional controls were lifted on 1 January 2014. Not surprisingly, the UK newspapers weren&#8217;t so quick to admit their erroneous assumptions and discriminatory policies as they were to come out with them in the first place. But, hey, nobody cares about issuing an apology almost a year later, right?</p>
<p>I felt particularly ashamed when people I&#8217;d met on my travels in Romania and Bulgaria asked me why the Brits were prejudiced against them. I&#8217;m talking about honest, hard-working people, many of whom have master degrees and are qualified professionals. The hard task of justifying a discriminatory policy is even harder when you don&#8217;t believe in it and I surely didn&#8217;t. Knowing many successful people from those countries is not even necessary – applying some common sense, however, is. Just have a look at the size of the population of the two countries – the population of Romania is almost three times that of Bulgaria – and you&#8217;ll realise how different these are and how absurd coupling them is when speaking of the number of prospect immigrants to the UK?</p>
<p>But that was not the end of it. A similar situation arose in 2016. In the months leading to the referendum, Brexit supporters once again used the Balkans as a scare. Armed forces minister Penny Mordaunt blatantly called people from the five Balkan states to join the EU next <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/politics/1210050/britain-will-be-magnet-for-terrorists-and-gangsters-if-we-remain-in-eu-claims-armed-forces-minister/?CMP=OTH-applenews-sharing" target="_blank">&#8220;criminals&#8221;, &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, and &#8220;gangsters.&#8221;</a> Seems like the unknown Balkans will be used as a scare indefinitely. Or at least until they become somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>Brexit may well be the single most destructive step in UK foreign policy. As for the representatives of the Balkan nations living in the UK, the future looks pretty grim. Those who have not joined yet and are working hard towards that dream are disappointed as they face delays, to say the least. Those who are in (Romania, Croatia, and Bulgaria) might have problems travelling to and working in the UK.</p>

						<p>You have probably heard non-Europeans refer to Europe as a single country. Some might even ask which the European capital is. Has someone expected you to speak European? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d find that offensive or at least pretty ignorant. Now, what if I told you that many people think the Balkans is this place where people speak the same language and share the same history and have the same features? Don&#8217;t you think that would be a generalization that would border on discrimination?</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-21 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/the-balkan-mountains-autumn-300x231.jpg" alt="the-balkan-mountains-autumn" width="300" height="231" srcset="https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/the-balkan-mountains-autumn-300x231.jpg 300w, https://www.balkanpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/the-balkan-mountains-autumn.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Though the Balkans are more of a cultural and political concept, they cover a physical territory on the Balkan peninsula and as such can be analyzed from a geographical perspective. The Balkans are a diverse mix of mountains and forests, rivers and lakes, wide valleys and hilly grasslands, flat or rolling countryside. Actually, did you know that the name Balkans comes from the Balkan Mountains, which are a 560 km mountain range that starts in Serbia and sprawls towards the Bulgarian Black Sea coast?</p>
<p>The Balkan Mountains are a remarkable range with steep cliffs as well as rounded mountaintops. There are many views that would take your breath away, including refreshing waterfalls and colourful woodlands. Drive and hike through the Mountains in any season and you&#8217;re sure to see something you haven&#8217;t noticed before.</p>
<p>I personally picture the Balkans whenever someone mentions autumn because that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find the most wonderful celebration of the colours of autumn. Take the motorway through the Danube River plain in Bulgaria and you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy the dancing colours of the autumn trees that look so enchantingly splashed across the mountainside on the horizon.</p>
<p>Other notable mountain ranges on the Balkans are the Dinaric Alps in BiH and the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. Not all mountain ranges are particularly high. For example, in BiH the terrain is quite mountainous but it comes nowhere near the highest peak of the Balkan Mountains – Mt. Botev with its 2,376 metres. There are many national parks and reserves throughout the peninsula including a transnational park that unites Albania, Kosovo, and Montenegro.</p>
<p>The Balkan peninsula, bordered by the Adriatic Sea on the northwest, the Ionian Sea on the southwest, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea on the south and southeast, and the Black Sea on the east and northeast, offers plenty of options for those who like seaside holidays. Try Mainland Greece or the Greek islands, Croatia or Bulgaria – all those abound in popular tourist spots.</p>
<p>But no matter where you go or what you do, don&#8217;t assume you know the Balkan people because you&#8217;ve met one somewhere. The nations living in this region deserve not to be squashed together in a single, unifying group. Meet people and get to know them and appreciate them for who they are. Don&#8217;t let yourself fall for stereotypes. Otehrwise, you&#8217;d become the stereotypical, prejudiced foreigner. Also, be mindful that the physical boundaries of the Balkans have been hotly contested and are still not officially agreed upon. Since it&#8217;s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans#The_Balkans" target="_blank">abstract term, &#8220;the Balkans&#8221;</a> is open for a discussion as to what it encompasses.</p>

I&#8217;m your real-life Englishman in New York. Except that it&#8217;s not New York but the Balkans. You&#8217;ve probably heard the name but can you honestly say you know what it stands for? Mostly imagined as a place of political conflict, the Balkans are some kind of a mystery to many Brits.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I started this blog.

I&#8217;m the old geezer sitting at a bench, quietly feeding the squirrels but mention the Balkans and I&#8217;ll give you the names of the countries and their capitals. And a few personal stories, too.</p>
<p>The Balkans have been part of my life for 25 years. In late 1991, soon after the Fall of the Iron Curtain and the following break-up of Yugoslavia, I started teaching English in Macedonia. I later moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where I met my wife, Kate. Kate is from Birmingham, so it was ironic we had to meet there. It was a sign we had to stay.</p>
<p>We are a Balkan family. We got married in Slovenia. Our son was born in Romania and our daughter – in Greece. With the kids now gone, Kate and I spend our time in either Kate&#8217;s family house in Yardley, east Birmingham, or in one of our cottages in Turkey, Croatia, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>We tried changing the world by changing our family. I think we did good. But with age comes wisdom, so I don&#8217;t try to change anyone any more. I need my peace and quiet. And what gives me my peace of mind lately are online casino games. From the cultural and political peace in the Balkans to the metaphorical peace of mind when I play games – that&#8217;s what you can expect from me. Welcome to my blog – I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy my stories.</p>
