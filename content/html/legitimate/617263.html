<P><CENTER><B>No One Was More Talented, Touching or Innovative</B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>&quot;Just take Miss Normand at her screen value, and
you know her.&quot;<BR>
James Quirk in <B><I>Photoplay</I></B>, August 1915</CENTER></P>

<P>Of all the comediennes of the silent film era, none was more
talented and touching, more original and funny than Mabel Normand.
As well as being one of early film comedy's most notable stars,
she was also one of its most innovative and creative pioneers.
 </P>

<P>In many ways she equaled, and in some cases outdid, the work
of her more famous male counterparts. Unfortunately, the subtlety,
range and freshness of her work has too often been ignorantly
made light of. The reason for this is, not surprisingly, ascribed
to the scandals which abruptly ended her career. True as this
is, a persuasive case could be made as well, for gender bias,
since it was not considered possible to take a very pretty girl's
intelligence, let alone artistic genius, seriously. Yet as crucial
as this, as well, is the fact that the wide scope of her accomplishment
simply cannot be ascertained by screening a mere few of her films.
In a career which spanned from 1911 to 1927 she made at least
198 films: 176 shorts and 22 features (four reels or more). During
this period she went through many changes, both negative and positive,
some insignificant, some considerable. Often time the negative
changes were a result of personal, as well as public, misfortunes
in her life. </P>

<P>On the positive side she improved and developed as one would
expect a hard working artist to. The problem, however, was that
the negative factors could at times seriously set back the progress
she did make. For example, in the natural course of maturing,
she at times seems to have lost much of that florid innocence
and youthful naivet&eacute; which contributed to making her earliest
films exceptionally charming. The younger Mabel is, generally
speaking,  more noticeably exuberant than the later one -- to
say the least. So even though Mabel advanced in her work in one
way, there was simultaneously a gradual loss to her well-being
stemming from external events. It is the incidental life-affecting
factors like these, some of them normal, some of them unusual,
which have served to deprive film historians and scholars of a
clear summary of her merit. Since so much is varied in Mabel Normand's
story, brief assessments about her overall ability as an artist
rarely do her justice, and often need to be qualified. There's
simply so much that would seem to require explanation. To attempt
now, years later, to properly value and fairly appreciate Mabel
Normand's greatness then requires much more than the casual eye
and analysis which most silent film comedy is wont to receive.</P>

<P>It is the intent of this essay to survey aspects of her art
and screen technique in that part of her career spanning from
her first Vitagraph films in 1911, to her time at Biograph and
Keystone, up until her last films made for Triangle-Keystone in
1916. A very good argument could be made that this period from
1911 through 1916 was the high-point of her artistic energy and
creativity. Be this as it may, this period does serve as a convenient
span of years with which to demonstrate some of the many sides
of her comic acting technique. While she did direct and write
a few scripts for some of her own short comedies, it is as a performer
that she stands out, and it is in this light that she is best
evaluated and considered. (12)</P>

<P><CENTER><B>The Normand Beauty</B></CENTER></P>

<P>A native of Staten Island, New York, Mabel at her tallest was
five foot in height with luxuriously thick dark brown hair and
beautifully expressive dark brown eyes. In all, she was, as seen
in photographs and attested by her contemporaries, an adorable
and attractive young girl. This is particularly necessary to note
because being very small and pretty gave her room to behave in
ways that otherwise might not be so amusing if someone less attractive
did those same things. In the way we might indulge a young child,
a pup or kitten for their somewhat unruly behavior because they
are so naturally lovable, so &quot;Mabel&quot; could get away
with things others couldn't. The same behavior coming from someone
else less delightful, less attractive, more physically powerful,
on the other hand, would be much less funny, if not outright offensive.
</P>

<P>It needs also be mentioned  that &quot;Mabel,&quot; while mischievous,
and in rarer instances even obnoxious (as in &quot;Mabel's Wilful
Way&quot;) was never callous or mean spirited. She would, often
as not, tenderly apologize to a fellow character after having
pulled a prank on them, and with sincerity meant it. If she acts
up or misbehaves, we know it is never because her heart is in
the wrong place. Minor touches like these are worth noting as
they help explain the warmth and allure of her brand of humor.</P>

<P>Since her father often worked in theaters, it is more than
likely Mabel, growing up, picked up much of her dramatic education
from shows she saw or heard about. Before entering films she worked
as an artist's model in New York City, posing for such notable
advertising illustrators as Charles Dana Gibson, James Montgomery
Flagg, the Leydendecker brothers, and C. Coles Phillips, and a
number of studio photographers as well. This kind of background
certainly had a most important impact on her film acting, since
modeling required her to assume all kinds of emotional dispositions,
attitudes, and postures. When an illustrator asked her to show
longing, sadness, delight or gaiety, that was just what she had
to learn and give herself to do. It was through the resultant
training of these modeling sessions then that Mabel developed
a quick-reference repertoire of ways to successfully impart different
feelings and emotions.  </P>

<P><CENTER><B>Making the Short Films</B></CENTER></P>

<P>From modeling, Mabel, on the recommendation of some modeling
friends and associates, went into the burgeoning business of movie
making. It was 1911 and she was about eighteen years old. She
first worked briefly at D. W. Griffith's Biograph Company located
in New York's lower east side, then for a few months at Vitagraph
in Flatbush, then once again for Biograph. She made films at Biograph
first for Griffith and subsequently for Mack Sennett. Then in
the Spring of 1912, Mabel left Biograph with Sennett, Ford Sterling,
Fred Mace and Henry Lehrman to become part of the original Keystone
company, where comedies were to be the sole specialty.</P>

<P>Only one of her Vitagraph films is known to survive. Based
on what we do know from existing films and still photographs,
they have drawing room quality about them, and are amusing today
for their quaint innocence. One charming example of this appeal
might be a shot from &quot;Troublesome Secretaries&quot; where
&quot;Betty,&quot; played by Mabel, is walked home along a residential
lane by her boyfriend, Ralph Ince. As they stop their stroll,
he warily looks about him before kissing her on the forehead.
Mabel, all this while, coyly giggles at his respectful caution
and their audacity. After waving good-bye to each other, she walks
the rest of her way home with this curious look of concern on
her face, like someone who, out of bashful modesty, is not quite
sure whether her romantic inclinations not might get her into
trouble. One noteworthy thing here is that Mabel, in acting this
part, is so unusually bubbly, and at the same time so demure 
in expressing herself, that viewing this sequence simply makes
one smile.</P>

<P>&quot;Betty,&quot; a character Mabel often played as in her
Vitagraph comedies, was a young and lovely foil to John Bunny's
bumbling elder. She was in some ways the precursor to &quot;Keystone
Mabel.&quot; Though different, these characterizations do share
significant similarities. Both &quot;Betty&quot; and &quot;Mabel&quot;
are inclined to play and mischief. Both drive men's hearts to
distraction. The difference is that &quot;Betty&quot; is generally
more submissive and subdued than &quot;Mabel.&quot; Not that &quot;Betty&quot;
is timid, only &quot;Mabel&quot; is more wild and free spirited.
Unlike &quot;Mabel,&quot; &quot;Betty,&quot; for example, would
never be found kicking someone or hurling bricks. (3)</P>

<P>While she is overflowingly lively in practically all her early
films, she appears more circumspect in those made in the East.
When in the winter of 1911 she first went with the Biograph company
on its annual trip West, Southern California, with its sunshine
and orange groves, seems to have made her personality blossom
forth. The change of locale to a novel, relatively freer area,
allowed her to shed artificial apprehensions, and look at life
in a new light. While still &quot;girlish,&quot; her demeanor
is of someone more bold and self-willed; a person less restrained
by stringent societal conventions, and nineteenth century models
of proper female deportment.</P>

<P>In her earliest films made in  the East, like &quot;Troublesome
Secretaries,&quot; &quot;The Squaw's Love,&quot; and &quot;Saved
From Himself,&quot; Mabel seems to make an effort to suppress
laughter, and occasionally has a hard time of it. While it is
the laughter of youthfulness and girlishness, still there is a
wry quality about it, which expresses more intelligence than one
would associate with an ordinary adolescent girl. It is as if
she sees something about her that is amusing which those about
her can't see.</P>

<P>A handful of her Biograph films are dramas directed by Griffith.
The Griffith dramas, &quot;A Squaw's Love,&quot; &quot;The Mender
of Nets,&quot; &quot;The Eternal Mother,&quot; &quot;Saved From
Himself,&quot; are gems, and Mabel infuses herself expressively
in the various roles. It is interesting to see what Griffith was
able to evoke out of her, which is something often quite unlike
anything she did later. Yet this said, most of the films Mabel
made at Biograph were not dramas, but comedies directed by Mack
Sennett. </P>

<P><CENTER><B>Split Reels and One-Reelers</B></CENTER></P>

<P>The short films she appeared in during the period from 1911
to 1916, were mostly &quot;split&quot; (half reel) or else one
reel films, lasting from about five to ten minutes respectively,
though in the latter part of this period she expanded to two and
an occasional three reel films. Also it should be noted, these
early comedies, both Biograph and Keystone, made no pretension
to being great art. Indeed, the primary concern originally, as
admitted by Sennett, was to make money. The films were put together
and rolled off like products on an assembly line. This excessive
tendency to cut costs on individual films is especially evident
when we compare the Keystone films to carefully edited and orchestrated
shorts such as Chaplin made at Mutual. (4)</P>

<P>In a interview she did in the late twenties, Mabel described
Keystone's film production methods this way: </P>

<P>&quot;So we, like other companies, would stop in the middle
of one (film) and start another, simply rearranging the props,
pulling a pair of overalls on over my frock, putting  a cop's
cap on Fatty Arbuckle, and having Ford Sterling or Charlie Chaplin
chase us around in front of the camera.</P>

<P>&quot;There'd be no script, no plot, no idea of what we'd do
when we started -- and no title. All we needed was 600 or 700
feet of film showing us doing something and 300 or 400 feet of
educational film to tack on it, such as how sheep are sheared
or olives canned.&quot; (5)</P>

<P>For all their end result silliness, making these comedies took
a considerable amount of toil and effort. When Chaplin returned
to Hollywood to get his special Oscar in the seventies he visited
with Minta Durfee and recalled, in speaking with her, what hard
and regular work it was making those early films. (6)  How vigorous
in health and  disciplined in her work must she have been when
we realize (as was acknowledged by all) no performer worked harder
at Keystone than Mabel Normand.</P>

<P>The Biograph and Keystone comedies, as others have pointed
out, had their conceptual origin in conventional stage comedy,
stage burlesque, and newspaper comic strips. The players in these
humorous situations then were more absurd caricatures than real
life characters.<BR>
