Urraca was the eldest surviving child of Alfonso VI of León&nbsp;with his second wife <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("13886",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("13886")' href="/topics/Constance_of_Burgundy">Constance of Burgundy</a><span class="hp" id="m13886"><div class="hpHeader">Constance of Burgundy</div><div class="hpContent">Constance of Burgundy  was the daughter of Duke Robert I of Burgundy and Helie de Semur-en-Brionnais.

<H2> First marriage and widowhood </H2>
Urraca’s place in the line of succession made her the focus of dynastic politics, and she became a <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("40457",this,"child_marriage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("40457")' href="/topics/Child_marriage">child bride</a><span class="hp" id="m40457"><div class="hpHeader">Child marriage</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i40457"></div>Child marriage and child betrothal customs occur in various times and places, whereby children are given in matrimony - before marriageable age as defined by the commentator and often before puberty.

Reilly suggest that rather than a betrothal, the eight-year-old Urraca was fully wedded to Raymond of Burgundy as he almost immediately appears in protocol documents as Alfonso VI's son-in-law, a distinction that would not have been made without the marriage. Reilly doubts that the marriage was consummated until Urraca was 13, as she was placed under the protective guardianship of a trusted magnate. However, Urraca's pregnancy and stillbirth at age 14 suggests the marriage was consummated when she was 13 or 14 years old.<br />
<br />
Urraca's marriage to Raymond was part of Alfonso VI's diplomatic strategy to attract cross-Pyrenees alliances, and in 1105 she gave birth to a son, who would become Alfonso VII. However, after Raymond died in 1107, Urraca’s father contracted with Alfonso I of Aragon, known as the Battler, for a dynastic marriage with Urraca, opening the opportunity for uniting León-Castile with Aragón.<br />
<H2> Reign </H2>
Marriage negotiations were still underway when Alfonso VI died and Urraca became queen. Many of Alfonso VI’s advisers and leading magnates in the kingdom formed a “quiet opposition” to the marriage of the Queen to the King of Aragon. According to Bernard F. Reilly, these magnates feared the influence the King of Aragon might attempt to wield over Urraca and over Leonese politics.<br />
<br />
Urraca protested against the marriage but honoured her late father’s wishes (and the Royal Council's advice) and continued with the marriage negotiations, though she and her father’s closest advisers were growing weary of Alfonso I's demands. Despite the advisers' initial opposition, the prospect of Count <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("92341",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("92341")' href="/topics/Henry,_Count_of_Portugal">Henry of Portugal</a><span class="hp" id="m92341"><div class="hpHeader">Henry, Count of Portugal</div><div class="hpContent">Henry of Burgundy, Count of Portugal   was Count of Portugal from 1093 to his death.

As events would unfold, these advisers underestimated Urraca's political prowess, and later advised her to end the marriage.<br />
<H3>Second marriage </H3>
<div class='thumb tleft'><img src='http://image.absoluteastronomy.com/images/encyclopediaimages/d/do/doa_urraca.jpg'/></div>
The marriage of Urraca and Alfonso I almost immediately sparked rebellions in Galicia and scheming by her illegitimate half-sister <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("17656",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("17656")' href="/topics/Theresa,_Countess_of_Portugal">Theresa</a><span class="hp" id="m17656"><div class="hpHeader">Theresa, Countess of Portugal</div><div class="hpContent">Theresa of Portugal   was the first ruler of independent Portugal...</div><br></span>&nbsp;and brother-in-law <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("42970",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("42970")' href="/topics/Henry,_Count_of_Portugal">Henry</a><span class="hp" id="m42970"><div class="hpHeader">Henry, Count of Portugal</div><div class="hpContent">Henry of Burgundy, Count of Portugal   was Count of Portugal from 1093 to his death.

<br />
As their relationship soured, Urraca accused Alfonso of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("68284",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("68284")' href="/topics/Domestic_violence">physical abuse</a><span class="hp" id="m68284"><div class="hpHeader">Domestic violence</div><div class="hpContent">Domestic violence, also known as domestic abuse, spousal abuse, battering, family violence, and intimate partner violence , is broadly defined as a pattern of abusive behaviors by one or both partners in an intimate relationship such as marriage, dating, family, or cohabitation...</div><br></span>, and by May 1110 Urraca separated from Alfonso. In addition to her objections to Alfonso's handling of rebels, the couple had a falling-out over his execution of one of the rebels who had surrendered to the queen, to whom the queen was inclined to be merciful. Additionally, as Urraca was married to someone many in the kingdom objected to, the queen's son and heir became a rallying point for opponents to the marriage.<br />
<br />
Estrangement between husband and wife escalated from discrete and simmering hostilities into open armed warfare between the Leonese-Castilians and the Aragonese. An alliance between Alfonso of Aragon and Henry of Portugal culminated in the 1111 <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("93598",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("93598")' href="/topics/Battle_of_Candespina">Battle of Candespina</a><span class="hp" id="m93598"><div class="hpHeader">Battle of Candespina</div><div class="hpContent">The Battle of Candespina was fought on 26 October 1111 between the forces of Alfonso I of Aragon and those of his estranged wife, Urraca of León and Castile, in the Campo de la Espina near Sepúlveda.

Recovering these regions and expanding into Muslim lands would occupy much of Urraca's foreign policy.<br />
<br />
According to author Bernard F. Reilly, the measure of success for Urraca’s rule was her ability to restore and protect the integrity of her inheritance - that is, the kingdom of her father - and transmit that inheritance in full to her own heir. Policies and events pursued by Alfonso VI - namely legitimizing her brother and thereby providing an opportunity for her illegitimate half-sister to claim a portion of the patrimony, as well as the forced marriage with Alfonso I of Aragon - contributed in large part to the challenges Urraca faced upon her succession. Additionally, the circumstance of Urraca’s gender added a distinctive role-reversal dimension to diplomacy and politics, which Urraca used to her advantage.<br />

According to Reilly, the Historia Compostelana also attributes her "failings" to her gender, "the weakness and changeability of women, feminine perversity, and calls her a <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("22683",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("22683")' href="/topics/Jezebel">Jezebel</a><span class="hp" id="m22683"><div class="hpHeader">Jezebel</div><div class="hpContent">Jezebel may refer to:* Jezebel, wife of King Ahab*Jezebel, in the Book of Revelation 2:20 a prophetess in the church of Thyatira* Jezebel , starring Bette Davis and Henry Fonda* Jezebel , a blog aimed at women...</div><br></span>" for her liaisons with her leading magnates, with at least one relationship producing an illegitimate son. These observations were hardly neutral or dispassionate, according to Reilly, who wrote: "[T]here is no question that the queen is in control, perhaps all too much in control, of events." Urraca's use of sex in politics should be viewed more as a strategy that provided the queen with allies but without any masters.<br />
