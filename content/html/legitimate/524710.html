<p>Another day, another remake! But this isn't just a simple remake, oh no, not at all. <strong>Godzilla</strong> has been in some 28 movies over 55 years, including Roland Emmerich's recent disaster (no pun intended) of a movie from 1998. But even after all that, he's still coming back for more. <a href="http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17061">Bloody-Disgusting</a> is reporting that Legendary Pictures, the production company responsible for <em>The Dark Knight</em> and <em>Watchmen</em>, is "in early discussions" on another <em>Godzilla</em> movie of sorts. Word is that it will be a <strong>reboot</strong>, and not a remake or a sequel (which is at least good news I think), but that's all that they know (this is <em>very</em> early). Oh goodness.<span id="more-15834"></span></p>
<p>Wait a minute, I thought <em>Cloverfield</em> was supposed to be America's new Godzilla replacement, since J.J. Abrams wanted us to have our own famous movie monster? What happened there? I'm reporting this as a rumor because it's the first we've ever heard of it and I just need some kind of official confirmation before we start getting all upset. I'm not really a fan of the classic Japanese <em>Godzilla</em> stuff, and as for Emmerich's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767817478/firstshowingn-20"><em>Godzilla</em></a> movie, I didn't really care for it either. Obviously in the hands of Legendary Pictures this could mean some great things, but, let's not jump the gun yet. Because really, <strong>do we <em>need</em> another Godzilla?</strong></p>

			<p class="comment-alt">Imo, Cloverfield was a great movie and a nice replacement for Godzilla, they made it into something new and interesting - the way it was filmed was fun, would love more "FPS" like movies.

However as for giant monsters, meh. Godzilla is a classic, lets leave it at that shall we? And lets move on with, well you, something NEW. Tired of hearing about all the damn reboots and remakes - only really interested in very few of them (Alice in Wonderland and, well its actually a "sequel", Tron).

Sequals and reusing ideas with better technology in all its glory but it doesn't have to be the same movie, just abit better - change something.</p>

			<p class="comment">The monster from Cloverfeild could never compare to Godzilla... not to mention Godzilla would cook and eat his face. He has totally earned his place as a classic movie monster and will probably never go away. 

But i will never have a problem hearing that there is going to be another Godzilla movie because there has always been another Godzilla movie. Its like Batman... No matter what there's always going to be another Batman movie.

I just hope they don't fuck it up like they did in 98... god that was bad. But even if, ill see it, and then just wait for them to crank out another one.</p>

Emmerichs Godzilla was awful and Cloverfield is no replacement. It's a one hit wonder.

I would appreciate a new Godzilla movie, darker and not so funny, especially not funny and without Broderick (sorry pal). Emmerich is an idiot.</p>

For this new remake to work, It needs to stay true to the design of the original Godzilla in order for it to be recognizable, And since the original was a man in a suit, It will obviously be CGI.</p>

I would love to see an American, big budget, Godzilla reboot done right...Emmerich killed it, I was 6 when I saw that movie in theaters, and although I thought it was 'cool' it always puzzled me why Godzilla looked virtually nothing like Godzilla...here's hoping Legendary and WB can get this one made right.</p>

			<p class="comment">Answer is yes we do need another Godzilla movie because J.J. Abrams honestly did not make a good monster movie. He made a good movie, but it just didn't work for a good monster movie. The cloverfield monster just wasn't that interesting looking to be considered "America's Contending Monster," plus Godzilla could take that thing down in SECONDS. It was too skinny and lanky, easily knock it down by slapping it's legs.

Now another American Godzilla movie is something we don't need, but if it's along the lines of The Dark Knight, then maybe we might have something.</p>

you're crossing a very fine line. i think we are OWED another Godzilla movie! i think we DESERVE and are in dire need of something "good" with Big G's name on it again. im an old school japanese Gojira movie buff, a big fan of the early stuff and like everyone else i felt that the 1998 version spit in the face of us few and far between loyal Godzilla fans.

in the right hands this could work. JJ showed us that it's still fun and scary to see some massive force of destruction smash everything in between you and it-and it's ALIVE! =)</p>

			<p class="comment">They still make Godzilla movies in Japan...

There have been three or four since the shitty US version.  In the last one which came out in 2005, Godzilla kills the shitty US version by chucking him into a building (I believe it's the Sydney Opera House...) and then blows the shit out of him.

If they do decide to go after a reboot they should really try to capture the feel of the very first one.  The original Godzilla was a really great film.  If you want to see it, tho, I highly suggest you track down the ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION.  When they released the film here in the states, they didn't release the original.  They re-shot half of it with an american actor playing a journalist.  Then they cut a buttload of scenes and replaced them with scenes of the journalist describing what's going on instead of showing the monster or the scenes of destruction.

The first film is arguably the best in the whole series due to it's darker atmosphere and the fact that it was shot in grainy black and white by someone who knew how to make a guy in a rubber suit look more like a giant monster and less like a guy in a suit.  You can still tell, but they at least do a better job of hiding it and don't do anything overly campy or goofy with the character (like having him dance or do flying drop-kicks or anything...).

But yeah, if you're gonna re-boot the series, you have to do it logically with a feel for the original.  You might be able to do it if you used toxic waste instead of atomic energy - set it up for modern environmental issues rather than nuclear issues.  The original was made by a country that had experienced the horrors of atomic warfare.  Godzilla was one of the creative results of trying to cope with those disasters, and less than a decade after they had happened.

The Emmerich version had the right idea, but they wrote it really poorly.  No real plot, so instead they just littered the script with sub plots and weird, goofy characters.  They tried to inject far too much comedy into the thing.  That's really the problem with a lot of these big-huge hollywood pictures.  They will take something that would normally be really serious and then instead of emphasizing the gravity of what's happening - what a normal filmmaker does - they would cheapen them with some of the worst comedy ever written.  I think that, the fact that they removed the Atomic Breath, the 'baby godzillas' which were just 'Raptor rip-offs', and the really really stupid main plotline are what killed the Emmerich version.  I mean, they find the fucking thing, lose it, find it, lose it again....  This is fucking manhattan.  How the fuck do you lose a 200 ft monster in manhattan when you've got helicopters and troops all over the place?  Wasn't anyone actually keeping an eye on the giant monster?

They took the name of a huge Franchise and placed onto of a Monster that if at all slightly resembled Godzilla.

If they bring back the Older, More bad-ass Creature, With fire, and almost cant be stoped. Without a cheesey love story, Goofy characters, and Godzilla babys? I hatted that part.. . .  If that can actually do a REAL American Godzilla right, Then im 100000000% for this film.

I loved Godzilla as a boy, An would personally love the see the big guy get a GOOD MOVIE. But if its gonnabe another shitter like the 1998 then just leave godzilla alone. 

But if the dark knight and watchmen people are on this. It could be very well what Godzilla needs.</p>

			<p class="comment-alt">Many people loved the 1998 Godzilla, why? Because the guy who directed Independence Day did it? Maybe they said "Hey, let's go see shit blow up like in that one movie he did." Ladies and Gentleman, you don't see "Godzilla" beneath the 2012 poster in between Director of "Independence Day" and "The Day After Tomorrow" do you? IT'S NOT THERE FOR A REASON! People might also have loved it, because the Taco Bell dog was talking about it in his burrito commerials. Most people who've only watched Roland Emerich's GINO(Godzilla In Name Only) movie, think that Gojira is an ASEXUAL GIANT IGUANA. Let me tell you something Hollywood, the Gojira I grew up with didn't shit eggs, run around scared, and hide in a damn city. When he came to a city, he didn't come to eat fish. He came to blow shit up! Now I have faith in this new remake, because I have faith in the childhood hero I had, but if these damn movie people in Hollywood keep getting their hands on Gojira movies and keep screwing them up like they have been with re-releases of old Gojira movies with horrible dubs and no japanese languages with subtitles, then they're just going to kill the good name of "The King of the Monsters."

			<p class="comment">Personally, I think a new Godzilla movie would be great!  Being 44 and growing up with the late 60's and the 70's versions I enjoyed the Godzilla movies, especially when he became somewhat human friendly.  I have a 5 year old who is now into Godzilla and I honestly don't know how that happened.  Could be the PS2 game an older neighbor boy gave him.  I think the 2 year old is starting to catch the fever too.

I have bought most of the movies that are available on DVD and a few on VHS for him.  He will sit and watch from beginning to end.  The Giant Monsters Attack Godzilla scared him because of the evil look on his face and his eyes.  The 1998 version of Godzilla was terrible and I hope the DVD (image of Godzilla) is never used again other than a coaster on the coffee table.  I hope a new one is made, more likely in 2014 for the 60th anniversary, so that I can continue to share in a common interest with my son.  The hard part is trying to find toys in stores.  I'm not paying an arm and a leg on ebay or anything like that.  

I also enjoyed Ultraman and Speed Racer on Saturday mornings as a kid.  They just don't make 'em like they used to!!</p>
