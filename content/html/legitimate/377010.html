<p><font size="2">Dear Mrs. Salisbury:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Enclosed you will find the results of my study of the Witten
Family in Maryland which actually occupied more time than the allotted
day.&nbsp; I collected all possible data on your known ancestor and attempted to
prove his parentage with the other families bearing that name in Maryland with
no apparent result.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">You will note that there were Wittens in Cecil County, where
the name Thomas figures in the latter 1600s, but from the available data at the Probate
Court I could not satisfactory prove the connection, if any.&nbsp; Then there
were Wittens living in Prince Georges County (from which Frederick County was
organized) at an early date but from the will it looked as if the testator held
no land - anyhow, I could not prove your ancestor, Thomas Witten, up to the sons
- John and William.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The only other medium of research which I can suggest is the
deeds in Cecil County and early Prince Georges as well as other land records
which were not covered in this research.&nbsp; For the deeds of Cecil County,
one would have to go to Elkton, the county seat, but some of the land records,
if any are available, can be obtained from Annapolis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Enclosed is also the Witten lineage to a Magna Charta
surety.&nbsp; The data supplied you on the Cecil family, I am sending by
registered mail under separate cover.&nbsp; I may add this.&nbsp; The source
reference for the emigration of John Cecil is Liber 4, folio 29, Land Office,
Annapolis, instead of Liber 6, folio 129, as indicated in your data.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Regret that I step beyond the commission and expressed my
opinion so frankly in my previous letter.&nbsp; I should have confined all my
remarks strictly to the task as commissioned by you.&nbsp; I acted, however,
with the best of intentions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Hoping that I may have the pleasure of serving you again in
the near future, and if you wish the land records and deeds, I shall be happy to
be of service.</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am working in the libraries here but haven't found anything
yet of importance.&nbsp; I did find the will of John Sollers of Calvert County,
Md. naming his daughter Elizabeth.&nbsp; When I return home I will type this up
for you.&nbsp; It seems to have been a man of much importance, coming first to
Anne Arundel County.&nbsp; His will was made in 1699 and Elizabeth was under
age.&nbsp; His wife married 2nd William Dolrumple (Dalrymple) in 1708.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe, however, I have found a clue to the ancestry of
Rebecca White and I am excited and afraid that it will not turn out but I find a
Gideon White of Joseph who came down from Peregrine White, the first White child
born in Mass.&nbsp; Just that much in Founds of Anne Arundel &amp; Howard Cos.
Md. by J.D. Warfield.&nbsp; This connects the Mass. Whites with the Maryland
family and I hope will be the long lost link that will connect the tradition
with fact.&nbsp; How I wish I had someone to go with me to Annapolis to the Hall
of Records to search for wills ets.&nbsp; I believe this is the first time one
has discovered this White family Maryland.&nbsp; There was mentioned a Rebecca
White 1695 which was too early for our Rebecca to have married about 1640.&nbsp;
I will try to go to Annapolis before I leave which will not be before
September.&nbsp; Our baby hasn't come yet.&nbsp; We expect her any time and I

</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> We do not have either of these in our
library.&nbsp; I have seen the History of Cecil Co., and I doubt if these old
histories can be bought except from Second Hand Book stores, as they are out of
print.&nbsp; I have never heard from my young friend down at Washington,
D.C.&nbsp; She may take time someday to look at these histories.<br>
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> My idea of hunting out all of the
Children and the grandchildren of the Mayflower William White and the great grandchildren
as far as I could and was that we would reach the dates of Rebecca White of Maryland
might make the connections.<br>
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> I will try, as I have material, to take
it up with Rebecca in Maryland and really learn just who was her father, then go
back from there.&nbsp; If you will read those records that I went you will find
about three or more generations of Guy Whites in Maryland.</font></p>

Note:&nbsp; John Evans married the widow of Guy White, Sarah.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">The Guy White in the first two, 1653, 1666, may
have been the same Guy who wrote the will 1676.&nbsp; he names a son Guy.&nbsp;
These must have all been of a descent.&nbsp; I have thought Rebecca might have
ben a daughter of Guy White.&nbsp; She might have been the daughter of the son
Guy named in the will of his father in 1712.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Yes, Rebecca may have been of the Mayflower
family.&nbsp; All that I can say is that the research that I have been able to
do with the material at hand does not show any connection of the New England
family with the Maryland family.&nbsp; With more local Maryland records, so that
I could find Rebecca in Maryland from her trace back it might be found.<br>

<p align="center"><b><font size="2">Letter from Mary Estes, VA to Evelyn
Salisbury, KY</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Pennington Gap, VA<br>
Sept. 27, 1946</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">My dear Mrs. Salisbury:</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> I am sending you all the
material I have on Rebecca White and it isn't much.&nbsp; I wish I had more to
send you.&nbsp; Mrs. E. E. Evans of 1511 University Ave, Columbia, Mo. has done
a lot of research on this and sent me what I have.&nbsp; I am copying what she
sent me.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> My sister who lives in
Washington had some correspondence with Mrs. Tynes regarding the family of
Rebecca White, and I believe she told me that Mrs. Tynes thinks someone made a
sampler and embroidered the names of all the ancestors from Peregrine White on
down together with the dates of birth etc. and that a Mrs. Anderson probably in
Kansas has this sampler.&nbsp; She says our Rebecca made the sampler.&nbsp; I
wrote to Mrs. Tynes about this but did not hear from her.&nbsp; If this is true,
and the sampler is in existence then it would be a very easy matter to trace it
out.&nbsp; I don't' care a lot about it for myself, but I do want tit because it
might mean a lot to my daughter in the years to come.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> This summer I had a letter
from Mrs. Millikan who is also interested in Rebecca.&nbsp; I will copy her
letter for you.&nbsp; If enough of us get behind this record I believe it can
eventually be traced out.&nbsp; I am not giving up right now.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2"> I am keeping your letter in a
file I have and if I find anything in the years to come that will interest you
will gladly send it on.&nbsp; And if you should ever get the line straightened
out i'd like to have a copy of it.</font></p>
