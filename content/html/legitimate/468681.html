In  presenting  the  following  pages  tc  the  public,  with  a  view 
to  set  before  them  more  forcibly  the  wretched  spiritual  desti- 
tution of  the  Upper  Canadian  emigrants,  it  may  be  expected 
from  me,  as  Editor,  that  I  should  give  some  preliminary  infor- 
mation. The  very  great  influx  of  emigrants  into  tlie  Canadas 
from  these  islands  seems  to  have  commenced  wiih  the  distresses 
produced  by  the  currency  debates  and  questions,  being  contem- 
poraneous with  the  carrying  of  that  bill. 

In  1819  the  number  rose  at  once  from  a  very  gradual 
increase  previously,  to  the  large  number  of  12,000  souls.     In 
1820  it  continued  increasing,  and  so  on  every  subsequent  year. 
In  1828,  and  the  following  years,  through  the  encouragement 
given  by  the  government  and  interested  parties  at  home,  the 
influx  became  still  more  rapid  and   overwhelming,   varying 
from  33,000  to  50,000,  53,000,  till  it  reached  its  climax  in  1833 
of  above  60,000  souls.    Of  course  it  would  be  naturally  expected 
imder  a  Christian  government,  that  a  provision  adequate  to  the 
spiritual  Avants  of  this  enonnous  mass  of  CliristJan  people,  (at 
least  the  descendants  of  Christians,  and  the  subjects  of  a  no- 
minally Christian  gr  v-ernment,)  or  bearing  some  proportion  to 
it,  would  be  made,  but  the  reverse  was  the  case ;  and,  in  courtesy 
to  Mr.  Joseph  Hume,  the  late  Mr.  Canning  and  his  colleagues  in 
1824  adopted  a  system  gradually  to  diminish  even  the  means 
(small  as  they  were)  heretofore  granted  to  the  Protestant  Church 
in  Canada.  No  words  of  mine  can  adequately  describe  the  hein- 
ousness  of  such  a  proceeding  ;  and  to  that  false  step,  and  others 
of  a  similar  tendency  at  home,  must  be  ascribed  by  every  one  in 
the  least  conversant  with  scripture,  the  downward  progress  of 
England  since.    It  was  the  first  decided  triumph  of  popery  over 
truth  in  the  counsels  of  Great  Britain — 1  Kings,  xx.  31 — 34. 
I  pray  God  the  result  may  not  extend  so  far,  but  that  in  mercy 
to  the  ignorance  of  the  people  of  this  country  "  The  Lord  will 
"  yet  be  entreated  for  the  land,  and  the  plague  be  stayed  from 
"  Israel." — 2  Sam.   xxiv.  13 — 25.     Quitting,  however,  these 
awful  considerations,  I  shall  proceed  to  my  more  immediate 
concern — the  conduct  and  proceedings  of  the  late  Bishop  of

Quebec,  under  the  difficulties  which  surrounded  him.  I  cannot 
better  introduce  the  subject  than  by  using  the  words  of  the 
venerable  and  lamented  Prelate,  in  an  appeal  which  he  made 
to  the  public,  dated  liondon,  August  the  26th,  1823,  before  his 
appointment  to  the  Diocese. 

En  his  capacity  of  Visiting  Missionary  he  had  visited  all 
parts  of  the  two  Provinces  during  the  years  1820  and  1821, 
and  at  the  conclusion  of  his  circuit  he  came  to  England, 
hoping  to  obtain  means  for  building  ChurcheS;  the  want  of 
which  he  so  feelingly  describes,  lie  had  but  just  left  the 
scene  of  destitution ;  his  words  come  to  us,  therefore,  warm 
from  his  heart ;  and,  with  all  the  force  of  an  eye-witness,  to 
the  wretchedness  for  Avhich  he  pleads.  "  It  would  be  very 
"  easy,  says  the  venerable  Prelate,  in  a  late  address,  that  of 
1834,  for  a  more  able  hand  than  mine  to  draw  a  moving 
l)icture  of  their  wants,  their  claims,  and  their  distresses,  and 
to  enlist  every  good  feeling  of  your  hearts  in  their  cause,  but 
I  shall  be  satisfied  in  laying  before  you  a  brief  and  plain 
statement,  confident  that  it  will  be  sufficient  to  induce  you 
to  give  them  your  present,  and,  as  I  hope,  continued  assis- 
"  tance."  Our  present  business,  however,  lies  with  the  previous 
appeal  of  1823. 

"  The  importance  of  religion  and  public  worship  to  every 
community  is  a  topic  upon  which  it  is  unnecessary  for  me  to 
enlarge.  Forty  years  ago  the  greater  part  of  the  Canadas 
WHS  an  uninhabited  wilderness  ;  the  settlers  were  labourers 
or  poor  farmers  ;  they  were  obliged  to  build  houses  for  them- 
selves, and  as  the  forest  yielded  gradually  to  their  labour, 
barns  for  their  stock  and  grain  ;  roads  also  were  to  be  made, 
schools  to  be  erected,  and  all  this  was  to  be  accomplished  with 
little  or  no  assistance  from  any  public  fund. 

"  The  peculiar  and  interesting  situation  of  many  thousands 
of  emigrants  from  every  pai't  of  the  United  Empire,  subjected 
to  these  difficulties,  calls  loudly  for  the  active  benevolence,  the 
sympathy,  and  the  assistance  of  their  more  fortunate  fellow- 
counti'ymen  at  home.  Let  it  be  remembered  that  these  poor 
people  (many  to  avoid  the  stigma  attached  in  their  minds  to 
parochial  aid)  have  left  their  native  country,  their  dearest 
relatives  and  friends,  their  parish,  and  their  church,  with  few 
of  the  necessaries,  and  still  fewer  of  the  comforts  of  life. 
Their  minds  naturally  dwell  with  regret  upon  all  they  have 
left.  They  ardently  desire  a  Church  and  a  Pastor, — but,  alas ! 
without  assistance,  these  blessings  they  are  unable  to  procure. 
While  the  impressions  of  home  are  recent,  they  are  earnest 
and  anxious  in  their  Ijngings  to  obtain  the  benefit  of  those 
institutions  for  the  care  of  their  souls,  and  the  instruction  of

their  families,  to  which  they  had  been  accustomed  in  Britain  ; 
and  every  pious  and  sincere  Christian  must  surely  wish  to  t?n- 
courage,  and  keep  such  sentiments  plive.  To  assist  the 
Canadian  emij^rants  in  these  important  matters  will  be  a  jfood 
and  laudable  work,  and  will  eventually  prove  a  lasting  benefit 
alike  to  themselves  and  to  the  country  thoy  have  left."  Such 
was  the  forcible  language  of  this  zealous  and  venerable  prelate 
in  1823,  and  as  evidence  of  the  truth  of  his  statement,  and  the 
extent  of  his  distress,  I  shall  quote  a  passage  from  a  Laynuui, 
a  cursory  visitor  in  the  country. 

Mr.  Ilowison,  in  his  "  Sketclies  of  Upper  Canada,"  among 
many  other  passages  of  a  similar  tendency,  inakes  this  remark 
respecting  the  district  near  Ancaster. — Pages  157 — 8.  "  There 
"  is  a  Church  near  it,  in  which  an  Episcopalian  Clergyman  of- 
"  ficiates  every  Sunday.  Exclusive  of  this,  there  are  but  two 
"  places  between  Niagara  and  Ancaster  (a  distance  of  50  miles) 
''  where  divine  service  is  regularly  performed.  Thus,  in  the 
"  space  of  300  miles  there  are  but /oh&gt;"  villages  at  which  public 
"  worship  is  regularly  performed  throughout  the  year.  It  is 
"  evident  (this  Layman  proceeds)  that  this  deficiency  in  the 
"  number  of  religious  establishments  must  have  a  fatal  effect 
"  upon  tlie  principles  of  the  people ;  for  the  Sabbath,  presenting 
'*  no  routine  of  duty  to  their  recollection,  gradually  approxi- 
"  mates  to  a  week-day.  Tliey  abstain,  indeed,  from  labour, 
"  but  spend  the  day  in  idleness  and  amusement,  strolling 
"  among  the  woods,  shooting  game,  or  in  wandering  listlessly 
"  from  house  to  house," 

Add  to  this,  I  have  at  this  moment,  within  three  miles  of 
the  spot  on  which  I  write,  the  instance  of  a  respectable  family 
which  emigrated  with  sufficient  means  and  habits  of  industry, 
promising  temporal  advantage,  yet  were  so  unhappy  in  the 
destitution  of  spiritual  comforts,  that  they  returned,  professing 
"  that  they  could  not  for  any  earthly  good,  bear  the  misery  of 
"  living  in  a  country  where  no  difference  existed  between 
"  Sunday  and  work-day."  "  The  situation  of  our  fellow-country- 
"  nion  (continues  Dr.  Stewart)  and  of  the  Indians,  is,  therefore, 
"  in  every  point  of  view,  worthy  of  the  attention  of  all ;  and 
"  the  interests  of  religion  have  probably  in  no  part  of  the  world 
"  stronger  claims,  not  only  on  the  christian  benevolence,  but  on 
"  the  jmtice  of  this  country."  These  considerations,  and  the 
important  effects  already  produced  by  the  former  contribu- 
tions for  building  Churches,  towards  promoting  true  and  sound 
religion,  and  enabling  the  descendants  of  a  christian  people  to 
worship  God  in  "  his  house  of  prayer"  cannot  but  recommend 
the  present  appeal  to  the  approbation  and  support  of  every 
pious  mind.     In  order  to  explain  the  allusion  in  this  last  pas- 

b2 


Xll 


sapfc,  and  to  shew  liow  steadfastly,  from  first  to  last,  the  Bishop 
pursued  this  important  object,  it  may  be  well  to  notice  his 
earlier  proceed injjjs. 

The  advanced  age  of  his  mother,  and  iier  reluctance  to 
consent  to  his  long  absence  in  Canada,  induced  Dr.  Stewart  to 
come  over  to  this  country  in  181G,  and  to  promise  that  during 
her  life,  he  would  continue  to  do  so  once  in  two  years.  But 
in  these  visits,  the  'nterests  of  the  destitute  emigrants  were 
uppermost  in  his  mind,  and  he  resolved  to  make  the  duty  of 
filial  i)iety,  instrumental  to  tlie  benefit  of  their  cause.  He 
commenced  a  subscription  for  the  purpose  of  aiding  the 
Settlers  in  the  building  of  Churches,  and  the  Government  of 
that  day  promised  the  salary  of  a  resident  Missionary  to  such 
settlements  as  exerted  themselves  to  build  the  Church  and 
Parsonage  House.  Hoav  this  promii^e  has  been  fulfilled  events 
have  shewn.  In  his  absence  the  subscription  was  still  carried 
on,  though,  of  course,  on  a  smaller  scale,  and  the  sura  raised 
between  1816  and  1823,  amounted  to  something  more  than 
£2,000,  and  was  instrumental  to  the  building  of  twenty-four 
Churches.  The  new  lights  of  an  Infidel  parsimony  soon  after 
this  dawned  upon  the  Cabinet,  and  though,  as  we  have  seen, 
the  mass  of  destitute  souls  was  increasing  annually  to  so  great 
an  extent,  tlie  resources  of  the  Church  were  so  scandalously 
diminished,  that  not  only  no  new  mission  could  be  opened,  but 
even  these  very  Churches  could  be  but  imperfectly  supplied. 

In  1826,  Dr.  Stewart  was  appointed  to  the  See,  vacant  by 
the  death  of  Dr.  Mountain.  The  great  and  continued  influx 
of  emigrants  again  induced  this  zealous  and  apostolic  Mis- 
sionary to  intercede  in  behalf  of  his  neglected  flock ;  but  the 
pathetic  intercessions,  the  earnest  appeals  of  a  Protestant 
Bishop,  and  the  cries  of  a  destitute  people  were  alike  thrown 
away — an  Infidel,  Unchristian,  and  Anti-Protestant  parsimony 
prevailed,  and  "  when  the  children  asked  for  bread,  the  parent 
"  state  threw  them  a  stone."  Parliament  appoints  its  commis- 
sioners and  its  officers  to  superintend  emigration  ;  estimates 
and  contracts  at  so  much  a  head  are  rife  at  the  sea  i)orts  ;  the 
parishes  from  one  end  of  the  kingdom  to  the  other  are  en- 
couraged even  to  borrow  money  for  the  purpose  of  transporting 
their  pauper  population,  and  the  same  wind  which  carries  out 
these  hapless  incumbrances  of  the  mother  country,  carries  out 
also  orders  *'  that  no  new  missions  are  to  be  opened,"  and  that 
even  those  which  previously  existed  should  be  "  put  upon  short 
"allowance."  Oh  England!  England!  England!  is  this  the 
return  thou  makest  for  all  the  blessings  which  have  been 
poured  down  upon  thee,  to  drive  away  thy  christian  people,  to 
pour  them  in  thousands  and  tens  of  thousands  upon  a  desert

l)infr  of  Mammon,  to  a  life  of  lleathenisnj  ?  The  Psalmist 
represents  as  the  very  climax  of  nnsery  and  destitution  "  No 
"  man  careth  for  my  soul  ;"  yet  to  this  climax  of  misery 
and  destitution  a  christian  ])Coi)le,  aiul  a  nominally  christian 
{Tovernment,  devotes  their  Canadian  brethren.  AVhat  could  a 
Bishop  do  ?  Year  after  year  the  same  strong  remonstrances 
are  made,  justified  and  strengthened  as  they  were  by  the 
annual  return  of  emigration— in  1832,  r}0,0()0,  in  UV.i'.i,  (J0,000, 
but  all  is  of  no  avail,  "a  heavy  blow  and  discouragement'"  is 
to  fall  upon  the  Protestant  Church,  and  Canada  must  be  the 
first  to  sacrifice.  The  sccurlti/  of  lioitianhm  in  the  '* Lower  Prorhw* " 
depends  upon  heatheni/ing  the  "  Ui»per."  Hume,  and  K(tt- 
buck,  and  Pajjineau,  and  (last,  not  least,)  O'Connell,  must  be 
propitiated,  even  at  the  expence  of  the  salvation  of  above 
300,000  souls. 

Deserted,  nay,  devoted  to  destruction  by  the  successive 
governments,  dei)rived  of  national  aid  through  the  ignorance 
and  apathy  of  a  Protestant  people,  the  Bishop  thus  concludes 
an  important  dispatch  in  1833.  "The  prodigious  extent  of  my 
"  Diocese  (1300  miles  long),  the  rapid  increase  of  the  Protes- 
"  tant  population,  their  destitution,  where  every  thing  is  new  to 
"  them,  of  all  reijulnr  jirociniun  for  the  means  of  grace,  and  the 
"  utter  inadequacy  of  our  resources  to  supply  them,  render  it 
"  i  Itogether  no  light  or  easy  task  to  administer  the  charge  com- 
"  mitted  to  my  hands ;  and  I  feel  that  I  should  be  wholly 
"  unable  to  sustain  the  burden,  if  I  trusted  in  any  other  sufti- 
"  ciency  tlian  that  which  is  derived  from  the  mercy  and  grace 
"  of  God."  Who  can  wonder  that  an  excellent  constitution 
should  sink  under  such  accumulated  distress  ? 

In  1829-30,  the  annually  increasing  misery  and  destitu- 
tion, and  the  hopelessness  of  any  aid  from  home,  induced 
the  Bishop  to  press  upon  his  own  people  the  absolute  neces- 
sity of  extreme  exertion,  and  to  form  a  society  at  Toronto, 
for  the  two-fold  purpose  of  "  converting  and  civilizing  the 
"  Indians,"  and  thereby  rescuing  them  from  the  scandalous 
machinations  of  unprincipled  men  (see  the  Canadian  Tale), 
and  also  to  provide  for  the  remote  and  destitute  Settlers  thus 
poured  annually  upon  them,  the  small  modicum  of  spiritual 
aid,  which  district  Travelling  Missionaries  could  supply.  How 
grateful  and  acceptable  to  the  people,  but  how  utterly  inade- 
quate such  a  ministration  must  be,  (even  upon  a  more  ample 
scale,)  is  evident  enough  from  the  following  letters  and 
journals.  Even  as  it  is,  however,  it  has  this  essential  merit, 
it  prevents  the  recent  Settlers,  so  far  as  it  can  be  extended, 
from  falling  into  that  Heathen  state,  into  which  too  niany  of 

b3

their  predecessors  have  been  phmged.  It  keeps  alive  an&lt;l 
cherishes  in  their  bosoms  an  attachment  to,  and  a  lonjfing  for, 
the  spiritual  privileges  of  their  fathers,  and  prepares  them  to 
hail  with  gladness  those  better  days,  which  a  retnrn  to  christian 
feeling  in  the  mother  conntry  will  ultimately  produce.  The 
word  is  gone  out  "  The  gates  of  hell  shall  never  prevail  against 
"  the  truth,  and  though  the  labourers  be  few,  the  means  scanty, 
"  and  the  night  and  darkness  long,  yet  if  thos«»  few  zealously 
"  preach  the  truth — the  whole  counsel  of  God,  knowing  nothing 
"  but  Christ  and  Ilim  crucified,  their  comfort  and  ours  must 
"  rest  on  this  promise, assured  that  *  the  da^'  will  come  at  last, 
"  though  all  the  people  and  nations  of  the  earth  be  leagued 
"  against  it." 

But  even  in  this  pious  and  christiari  effort,  the  scantiness 
of  his  means  was  a  distressing  hinderance  to  the  venerable 
Bishop.  The  funds  which  could  be  raised  by  the  society, 
collectively  and  individually,  aided  also  by  casual  subscription 
from  English  friends,  were  barely  sufficient  to  sui)port  a 
Travelling  Missionary  (Mr.  Elliott,)  in  the  home  district  of 
Toronto ;  and  the  mission  of  Mr.  M'Murphy  to  the  Indians  on 
the  southern  shore  of  Lake  Huron,  at  Sault  St.  Marie.  Such 
was  the  state  of  things  in  the  conclusion  of  1833. 

In  the  following  year  this  truly  Apostolic  Prelate  made 
one  more,  alas,  one  last  effort  to  rouse  the  apathy  of  the 
mother  country,  and  to  gain  from  the  christian  feelings  of 
the  people,  those  succours  which  the  government  continued 
to  refuse. 

The  appeal  (found  in  the  Appendix)  reached  this  coimtry 
in  July,  1834.  Into  that  which  was  to  have  been  its  destined 
fate  I  have  no  disposition  to  enter.  By  weak  instruments 
Jehovah  not  unfrequently  over-rules  the  politics  of  man. 
The  appeal  was  made  public,  and  gave  rise  to  "  The  Upper 
"  Canadian  Travelling  Mission  Fund,"  an  engine  little  calcu- 
lated to  contend  with  such  a  mass  of  misery,  but  well  calculated 
to  give  prompt  assistance,  and  to  shed  a  ray  of  comfort  on  the 
latter  days  of  this  zealous  and  amiable  Bishop.  The  collection 
commenced  on  the  first  of  August,  1834,  and  the  result  has 
been — 

Ist. — Enabling  the  Bishop  and  the  society  at  Toronto  to 
establish  a  second  Travelling  Mission  (Mr.  Harper's)  through- 
out the  Midland  District  of  Upper  Canada. 

2ndly. — The  support  of  a  temporary  mission,  for  the  year 
1835,  in  the  district  of  Bridlington  Bay,  on  the  Lake  Ontario. 

3rdly. — Sending  out  the  Rev.  Henry  Vachell,  at  the  desire 
of  the  Bishop,  to  undertake  the  travelling  m'  sion  of  the 
London  District.     The  exigencies  of  the  Church,  upon  his

him  in  the  Lower  Proviiiees  for  a  time,  and  he  has  been  suc-

westerly  part  of  Upper  Canada,  near  the  Lake  St.  Clair. 

And  (Jthly. — In  enabling?  the  venerable  and  ever  to  be 
lamented  Prelate  to  alFord,  from  10:J5  to  1037,  casual  aid  to 
sundry  other  missions  in  distress — aid  which  he  had  j)romised 
out  of  his  own  purse,  but  which  he  was  prevented  from  fulfil- 
linn;  by  the  sacrifice  of  so  large  a  portion  of  his  salary,  to 
obtain  from  the  government  the  absolutely  needful  assistance 
of  a  coadjutor,  i.  e.,  to  obtain  for  his  Church  that  spiritual 
superintendence  wliich  labour,  anxiety,  and  their  inevitable 
consequence,  a  broken  constitution,  no  longer  allowed  him  to 
bestow. 

He  is  now  gone  to  the  i-eward  of  his  faithful  and  unweary- 
ing services  before  a  tlirone,  whose  ministers  will  duly  estimate 
their  value.  May  his  spirit  survive  amongst  us,  and  though 
as  a  nation  we  refused  him  assistance  during  life,  may  we  now, 
though  late,  rear  a  lasting  memorial  to  his  virtues,  by  fulfilling 
the  warmest  wishes  of  his  heart — "  that  the  neglected  wilder- 
ness of  Canada  may  resound  to  the  songs  of  Sion." 

The  short  biographical  sketch  of  his  Lordship,  which  is 
prefixed  to  the  volume,  was  taken  from  "  The  Colonial 
"  Churchman,"  a  paper  published  at  Halifax,  in  Nova  Scotia. 
It  first  appeared  in  a  Canadian  paper,  and  having  passed 
through  the  christian  press  of  the  United  States,  it  comes  to 
us  stamped  with  the  imprimatur  of  the  North  American 
Christian  Church — that  Church  best  able  to  estimate  his  value, 
as  he  had  devoted  his  life  to  its  service. 

The  Bishop  was  born  on  the  13th  of  April,  1775.  He  was 
privately  educated  at  home  till  he  entered  at  Oxford.  He  was 
elected  a  Fellow  of  All  Souls'  College,  and  upon  receiving 
Orders,  was  presented  by  the  late  Countess  of  Aboyne  to  the 
Vicarage  of  Orton  Longneville,  in  Northamptonshire.  But 
counting  as  nothing  the  prospects  which  his  rank  aud  connec- 
tions promised  to  procure  him  at  home,  he  commenced  his 
missionary  career  upon  the  establishment  of  the  S.P.G.F.  P.  in 


XVI 


1007.  Ho  first  settled  at  St.  Armand,  where  by  un weary in(&gt; 
lahuurand  private  co.st,  he  soon  formed  the  first  eonpfrej,'ation  in 
that  j)art  of  Lower  Canada.  Having  a('coni])lished  this  object, 
and  j)lante(l  the  standard  of  the  truth  in  the  very  heart  of 
Komanisin,  ho  n'signed  that  mission  to  the  Rev.  J.  lleid,  non 
to  a  genth;man  whose  father,  at  the  a&lt;,'e  of  TiO  or  upwards,  was 
the/nf*  fruits  of  liis  missionary  life. 

Upon  leaving  St.  Armand,  with  two  churches,  where  he 
found  none,  and  well  conducted  congn.'gations,  where  a  few 
yours  before  the  (Jospel  had  never  b(^en  preached,  he  procei-'ded 
to  undergo  the  same  labours,  privations,  and  expences,  witli 
e(|ual  success  at  lliitley;  there  he  continued  till  he  was  ap- 
pointed visiting  missionary  of  both  the  provinces  in  lOIJ).  He 
resigned  this  peculiar  charge  to  the  llev.  Thomas  Johnson, 
and  took  a  final  leave  of  Hatley,  .lanuaiy  2nd,  1820. 

In  182G,  ujion  the  death  of  Bishop  Moimtain,  he  was  raise  1 

to  the  See  ;  worn  out  by  labours,  difficulties,  and  anxieties,  he 

returned  to  England,  to  lay  his  bones  in  the  land  of  his  fathers 

in  November,  HWO,  and  on   the  lllth  of  July,  18;i7i  breatlied 

(mt  his  calm  and  pious  spirit  into  the  bosom  ef  his  Father,  his 

Saviour,  and  his  God,  having  but   just  lived  to  complete  his 

tiixtv-sccond  year.

THE  BISHOP  OF  QUEBEC. 


Tlie  following  brief  skotch  of  the  Bishop  of  Quebec,  is  ex- 
tractcd  from  "  The  Colonial  Churchnmn,"  a  jmper  edited  by  a 
society  of  Gentlemen,  and  published  at  Lunenburg,  in  Nova 
Scotia.  The  article  seems  originally  to  have  been  copied  from 
"  The  Courier  of  Upper  Canada" — and  speaks,  therefore,  icith  all 
the  authority  of  local  knoiclcdje,  and  we  must  consider  its  appear- 
ance in  the  &gt;1  ova  Scotia  paper  as  the  disinterested  "  Imprimatur" 
of  another  Diocese  to  its  truth.  It  appeared  in  the  Lunenburg 
l)aper,  Feb.  25th,  ISSO. 

"  A  Siiint  unspotted  of  the  world,  full  of  almsi-deedH,  full  of  humanity,  and 
all  the  examples  of  a  virtuous  life." — Isaac  fVaUon. 

Though  the  name  of  liishoj)  Stewart  be  not  so  widely  known 
as  that  01  Middleton,  James,  lleber,  or  Turner,  bright  lights  of 
the  Indian  Hierarchy,  though  it  be  not  conspicuous  in  the  annals 
of  Tlieologicul  Controversy,  or  rendered  memorable  by  literary 
labour  ami  scholastic  achievements,  yet  whereter  it  is  known^  it  is 
held  in  the  highest  veneration  and  respect,  and  adds  equally  to 
the  lustre  of  the  Colonial  Bench.  The  Bishop  of  Quebec  is  em- 
phatically a  (food  man.  He  stands  forth  to  the  world  a  primitive 
Apostolic  Bishop,  deriving  no  false  fictitious  reputation  from 
•pialities  more  dazzling  than  useful ;  and  whose  Mitre,  as  unsul- 
lied us  that  of  Hough,  is  ever  surrounded  by  a  bright  and  steady 
halo.  Many  men  have  revelled  during  their  youthful  days  in  the 
gratifications  of  sensual  pleasure,  till  wearied  and  nauseated  with 
a  surfeit  of  enjoyment,  and  having  exhausted  every  refinement 
of  vice,  they  liave  become  suddenly  metaraoi-phosed  into  harsh 
and  ascetic  bigots,  denying  to  others  a  healthful  draught  of  those 
l)leasures  which  themselves  have  quaffed  to  a  hurtful  excess. 
But  the  piety  of  our  Bishop  was  not  put  on  after  he  had  flung 
off  the  garments  of  unrighteousness.  It  was  a  clothing  he  had 
assumed  from  his  earliest  youth,  and  the  whiteness  of  his  Chris- 
tian vest  has  never  been  sullied  by  the  hot  passions  of  youth,  the 
ambitious  schemes  of  manhood,  or  the  grasping  avarice  of  old 
age.  Of  noble  birth,  and  connected  with  the  first  families  of  our 
Aristocracy,  Bishop  Stewart  has  ever  been  distinguished  for  un- 
ostentatious humility,  priding  himself  more  on  the  Chnstian 
badge  than  on  his  long  line  of  ancestry  and  royal  descent. 
Hannah  More,  writing  of  him  to  Daniel  Wilson  in  1831  says, "  I 
have  had  a  visit  from  my  valued  firiend  Dr.  S.  from  Canada.  It 
was  pleasant  to  hear  a  man  of  his  birth  speak  of  it  as  a  great  ad- 
rancement,  that  he  was  now  appointed  a  travelling  missionary, 
instead  of  a  local  one.  I  find  him  much  improved  in  spirituality. 
He  has  been  the  honoured  instrument,  since  we  last  met,  of 
causing  twenty-four  Churches  to  be  built." 

Though  our  Bishop  forbears  to  embroil  himself  in  the  politi- 
cal heats  that  inflame  this  Province,  he  strenuously  upholds  the 
interests,  and  the  establishment  by  law,  of  the  Church  committed 
to  his  care.  Every  society  tending  to  relieve  the  distressed,  to 
reform  the  wicked,  to  propagate  the  Gospel,  or  to  benefit  man- 
kind, receives  his  steady  and  benevolent  aid,  and,  like  Bernard 
Gilpin,  he  has  raised  from  a  lowly  state  more  tha:i  one  young 


person,  in  whom  ho  has  porcoivod  tho  ^crni  of  a  spiritual  nature, 
and  thu  proniiso  of  a  fitness  for  th(&gt;  niinistorial  office,  defravinj^ 
the  expi'ncoM  of  their  education,  and  sendiiijjf  them  forth  to  labour 
in  the  sacred  vineyard.  His  ])rivate  charities  flow  in  a  wide  and 
n»!ver  failinjr  current.  No  vain  pomp,  no  supei'fluous  luxuries, 
no  costly  furniture,  no  extravagant  bancpiets  exhaust  his  in- 
come, hut  on  tho  widow,  and  the  orphan,  aiul  the  fatherless,  and 
on  the  wretched,  his  bounty  silently  and  unceasin^dy  descends. 
His  luxuries  are  alms-deeds — his  walks  arc  to  the  houses  of 
mourning,  and  his  banquets  are  those  exciuisite  and  incorrup- 
tible viands,  which  a  ])ure  and  Nathaniel-like  (John  i.  47,)  life 
administers  to  him  who  leads  it,  and  to  those  who  come  within 
the  sphere  of  its  action. 

In  the  pulpit  Dr.  Stewart  delivers  plain  and  prpitical  dis- 
courses, stronj^ly  embued  with  Evangelical  Doctrines.  He  is 
more  remarkable  for  earnestness  than  elo([uence,  and  cares  far 
more  to  render  himself  intelligible  than  admired.  He  seeks  to 
win  souls  in  preference  to  courting  hunuin  applause  by  well 
rounded  periods,  or  tiowery  declanmtion. 

Bishop  Stewart  sustained  many  severe  j)rivations  and  fatigues 
in  travelling  through  the  almost  impervious  woods,  during  tho 
earlier  part  of  his  Ministry  (wliich  connnenced  in  101&gt;7)  ;  i^^ 
which  time,  we  ought  also  to  add,  ho  devoted  the  whole  of  his 
private  income  to  acts  of  charity,  and  the  wants  of  the  Canadian 
Infant  Episcopal  Church. 

These  journeys,  and  the  labours  and  hardships  encountered 
in  the  course  of  them  (added  to  tho  distressing  anxiety  the  wants 
of  his  Church  have  occasioned  him,  since  his  accession  to  the  See 
with  an  encreasing  population  and  declining  means),  have  ren- 
dered his  Lordship  prematurely  aged.  Though  born  only  in 
1775)  and  consequently  only  60  years  of  age,  he  bears  tho  ap- 
pearance of  being  at  least  fifteen  years  oldei*. 

if  the  hoary  head,  when  found  in  tho  ways  of  righteousness, 
be  a  crown  of  glory,  how  much  more  honoured  must  be  that 
head,  which  old  age  has  not  silvered  over,  but  which  has  been 
rendered  white  by  the  extreme  of  Missionai-y  toil,  by  many  a 
Aveary  travel  through  the  tangled  wilderness,  and  by  a  constant, 
unflinching  endurance  of  personal  labour  and  hazard  in  the  faith- 
ful discharge  of  the  most  sacred  duties.  Though  venerable  and 
dignified  in  his  aspect,  he  is  plain  and  simple  in  his  manners, 
serving  God  and  man  with  singleness  of  heart,  and  devoting 
every  thought  to  the  glory  of  the  first,  and  to  the  temporal  and 
eternal  advantage  of  the  latter. 

The  Church  of  England  may  boast  of  Prelates  more  learned, 
more  eloquent,  more  celebrated  than  Bishop  Stewart,  but  she 
cannot  exhibit  one  who  better  merits  the  title  of  "  good."  Such 
is  his  absence  of  guile,  his  single-hearted  benevolence,  his  un- 
dying faith  ripened  into  works,  his  practice  of  Apostolical  Chris- 
tianity, that  in  after  years  when  the  subject  and  the  writer  of 
this  article  shall  alike  be  gathered  to  their  fathers,  he  who  con- 
templates the  excellencies  of  this  amiable  Bishop  will  be  led 
involuntarily  to  exclaim,  in  the  words  of  the  Romish  Priest  over 
the  grave  of  Bishop  Bedell  "  O  !  sit  anima  mea  cum  Bedello."

CHARGE  OF  THE  BISHOP  OF  QUEBEC 

TO  TIIK  CLKUUY  (U'  TIIK  IHOCKSK  OF  QUKFilX', 

Iklirered  at  Jlontrful  on  the  \)th  Aiiifiixt,  ami  &lt;U  Yorky  I'^jijur  Canadiiy 

on  the  'M)th  Aihjnfty  \\V2i\. 


My  Reveuknd  Hiiktiiuen, 

On  this  nt'w  and  solemn  occasion  of  our  mootinf^,  many  topics 
(if  tifroftt  interest  present  tlieinselvcy  to  our  consideration.  I 
shall  select  those  which  &lt;h»inand  our  chief  attention  ;  even  t(» 
them,  I  fear,  that  I  cannot  do  that  full  justice  wHiich  their  im- 
portance deserves. 

The  subject  which  first  presses  itself  on  your  feelinps  and 
mine,  is  that  of  mutual  condolence  on  the  loss  we  have  sustained 
in  the  deatii  of  our  dear  and  excellent  friend  and  counsellor,  the 
late  IJishop  of  this  Diocese.  W(»  all  recollect  with  lively  remem- 
brance the  virtues  and  piety  of  his  character,  and  tln'  learninj^aiul 
abilities  which  distinj^uished  him  ;  and  with  yorr&lt;&gt;w  an&lt;l  sympathy 
we  reflect  on  our  bein^  deprived  of  his  t^xample  and  j'uidance. 
This  affectionate  remembrance,  and  these  just  reflections,  will 
always  stimulate  us,  1  trust,  to  f,'reater  watchfulness,  dilij^ence, 
and  exertions  in  the  performance  of  our  respective  (luties  :  but 
they  add  to  my  concern  on  your  accoimt,  and  to  anxiety  on  my 
own.  They  make  me  more  sensible  of  my  inferiority  in  many  re- 
spects, and  my  comparative  unfitness  for  so  &lt;^reat  a  char&lt;fe,  and  so 
responsible  an  office.  The  jdainness  of  this  call  to  humility  on 
my  part,  and  my  imjjrovement  of  it,  may  be  of  advantage  to  me, 
but  it  cannot  be  l)eneficial  to  you,  except,  in  the  occasion  it 
affords,  and  which  I  bcfjf  you  will  use,  of  exercisinj^  ji;reater 
charity  and  candour  towards  me.  'J'his,  however,  I  have 
encouragement  to  expect,  from  a  review  of  my  long  and  intimate 
acquaintance  with  many  of  you,  the  kind  reception  1  have  lately 
experienced,  and  the  very  favourable  sentiments  of  regard  for 
mo  which  you  have  so  warmly  expressed.  It  has  not  pleased  the 
giver  of  every  good  tind  perfect  gift  to  disj)ensc  his  talents 
(uiually  to  all.  Such  as  have  been  mercifully  granted  to  me  I 
shall  endeavotir  to  use  to  the  best  of  my  power  in  furtherance 
of  the  great  cause  we  have  at  heart ;  and  confiding  with  humility 
and  reverence  in  God's  l)lessing,  on  your  prayers  and  mine,  and 
on  our  joint  exertions,  I  trust  we  shall  be  mutually  profitable  to 
each  otiier,  and  to  the  jjcople  committed  to  onr  charge. 

The  sid)jects  of  which  I  propose  to  treat  are  those  which 
seem  to  me  most  important  to  the  interests  of  religion  in  general, 
and,  consequently,  to  the  increase  of  our  Church  in  particular,  to 
your  individual  advantage — to  the  edification  of  your  flocks — to 
the  great  work  of  saving  yourselves  and  others.  While  we  are 
engaged  in  the  consideration  of  these  momentous  subjects,  you 
must  expect  nothing  new  at  my  hands,  but  rather  learn  a  lesson  of 
perseverance  in  diligent  attention  to  those  services  which  you 
now  perform,  and  to  those  objects  which,  I  trust,  are  highest  in 
your  estimation.  It  is  good  for  us  to  be  exhorted  to  the 
remembrance  of  our  duties,  and  the  end  of  our  high  calling, 
that  we  may  be  encouraged  and  supported  in  the  pursuit,  and 
strengthened  in  striving  to  attain  the  accomplishment  of  our 


labours,  nml  tho  comfort  whirh  flowH  from  fnitli  in  tlu'ir  lin|»py 
result.  I  nIuiU  kcu))  in  viow  tluf  p(M;uliiir  cireiinistanccH  of  this 
country,  and  of  our  (.'liurch  in  Canada,  tint  inacconnnodatin^r  my 
ohHorvatioiiN  to  tliom,  it  is  not  nccossary  to  Ik*  niinutciv  dJHtinct 
in  pointiiifi^  out  t\w  a|i|&gt;li('ation  ;  tliiN,  you  will  readily  do  fui 
yoursolvcH ;  and  1  doubt  nut,  profit  by  tho  train  uf  thought  to 
which  thoy  nuiy  ^ivo  birth. 

In  tho  first  |»la(H»,  lot  us  direct  our  attention  to  tho  mannor 
in  which  Divino  Hcrvico  should  bo  conducted,  and  to  yotir 
ministration  in  those  offices  of  the  ("hnn-b  which  are  for  the  most 
part  of  a  public  nature.     Public  worship  is  the  first  &lt;luty  of  a 

tmblic  nature  which  wo  owe  to  (Jod,  ourselves,  and  our  nei^nbour. 
t  is  the  chief  of  all  the  means  in  our  power  of  maintaininf; 
relififion  in  our  neighbourhood.  If  men  do  not  meet  togetlu»r  to 
worship  (iod,  they  U'radually  for;;et  and  lose  si^'ht  of  their 
obli)j;atioiiH  to  him  and  one  another.  Thev  do  not  reflect  that 
ho  pfoverns  the  world,  and  that  there  is  a  time  of  jud^Miient  and 
retribution  to  come  ;  which  two  considerations  are  the  m-and 
foundation  of  all  morality  and  relififion.  The  institution,  tliore- 
fore,  of  a  Sabbath  day,  and  the  injunction  to  build  places  of 
worship,  with  a  view  of  promoting  the  jj;atherinj;  together  of 
people  to  adore  tlieir  Maker,  originated  in  that  divine  wisdom 
which  ordereth  all  things  for  the  /^ood  of  nuinkind,  and  thc^'Iory 
of  his  name.  He  commanded  his  i)eople  to  erect  a  sanctuary  to 
his  honour ;  and  he  gave  them  this  law,  Ye  shall  keep  my 
Sabbaths,  and  reverence  my  sanctuary.*  Association  is  natural 
to  men  ;  and  it  is  conducive  to  tlieir  common  advantajje  to  join 
together  in  the  pei'formance  of  a  good  work.  Tliev  cannot  be 
better  engaged  than  in  the  worship  of  (Jod  :  in  notlnng  do  they 
approach  so  nearly  to  the  happiness  of  a  glorified  state.  How 
important  is  it  then,  that  Divine  Service  should  be  celebrated  in 
a  manner  becoming  the  character  of  man,  and  the  perfections  of 
the  Deity  !  The  Liturgy  affords  great  assistance  to  the  people  in 
worshipping  God  in  spirit  and  in  truth — with  the  understanding 
also  ;  and  it  enables  them  with  one  mind  and  one  mouth  to 
praise  the  Lord,  and  to  speak  of  his  glory  in  his  temple.f  It 
maintains  unity  and  soundness  of  fSith  and  doctrine  in  the 
Church  ;  and  keeps  up  in  her  members  a  continual  acciuaintance 
with  the  essential  articles  of  religion,  so  that  they  cannot  easily 
lose  the  knowledge,  or  the  remembrance  of  them.  It  promotes 
order,  union  and  fervour  in  devotion  ;  is  suited  to  the  capacities 
of  those  who  aro  not  well  advanced  in  religious  knowledge  ;  and 
is  particularly  acceptable  and  edifying  to  the  most  devout  part 
of  the  congregation.  The  use  of  the  Common  Prayer  ought 
therefore,  to  be  reccommended  to  our  people,  by  every  means  in 
our  power.  Distinctness  in  reading  the  service,  in  pronouncing 
and  rehearsing  the  prayers  and  every  part  of  it,  is  an  essential 
object ;  but  nothing  will  so  much  contribute  to  a  just  under- 
standing and  estimation  of  its  excellence,  as  persuading  the 
congregation  to  join  with  their  voices  as  well  as  their  hearts  in 
the  celebration  of  the  service.  The  more  they  are  engaged  in 
the  performance,  the  more  they  will  partake  of  its  spirit,  and  be 
roused  by  the  pious  fervour  of  its  language.    This  is  conformable

clerk,  or  leader  in  these  resjiective  services. 

Another  pa"t  of  divine  sej-vice  connected  with  public  wor- 
ship 1  must  not  pass  over  in  silence  ;  at  the  same  time,  it  opens 
HO  wide  a  field  to  our  observation,  that  I  am  constrained  to  (lefer 
i\  particular  view  of  the  subject  to  another  occasion,  for  on  this 
first  opjiortunity  of  my  meeting  you  it  is  necess.sary  that  I  should 
be  general  in  my  remarks.  I  allude  to  jireaching,  or  Iho 
delivery  of  sermons.  To  the  devout  and  well  instructed  mem- 
bers ot  the  congregation  th.e  other  parts  of  divine  service  are 
unquestionably  of  the  first  imjiortance,  but  a  great  jirojiortion  of 
your  hearers  need  instruction  in  the  principles  of  the  doctrine  of 
Christ,^  and  that  the  foundation  of  these  things  should  be  laid 
again  and  again.  The  due  jierformance  of  tliis  part  of  your 
function  requires  your  assiduous  care,  and  yoiir  unwearied 
diligence. 

To  Timothy  the  Apostle  writes,  Give  attendance  to  reading, 
to  exhortation,  to  doctrine  :§  Preach  the  word  ;  be  instant  ! 
season,  out  of  season  ;  reprove,  rebuke,  exhort,  with  all  long 
suffering  and  doctrine.il  In  another  place  he  says,  How  shall 
they  hear  Avithout  a  preacher  ?  Faith  cometh  by  hearing,  and 
hearing  by  the  word  of  God.1i 

Following  the  Apostle's  admonition  and  example,  I  exhort 
you  to  preach  Christ  and  him  crucified,  Christ  the  power  of  God, 
and  the  wisdom  of  God.**     Set  forth  the  gifts  and  fruits  of  the

Holy  Spirit — our  need  of  the  ono,  our  unrenewed  and  unprofit- 
able state  witliout  the  otlier.  We  are  to  teach  all  nations, 
haptisiny-  them  in  the  name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Hon,  and 
of  till'  Holy  (rhost  ;  Teaehinj,'  them  to  observe  all  things 
whatsoever  I  have  commanded  you  :  and,  lo,  1  am  witli  y!&gt;n 
ahsay,  ev(Mi  unto  the  end  of  tlie  world.*  A  Charj^e  which 
enjoins  instruction  in  the  attributes  of  the  Deity,  aiul  in  the 
duties  arisinji;  from  the  relationship  which  by  the  Christian 
covenant  we  bear  tc  the  Creator,  Itedeemer,  and  Sanctifier, — 
principles  of  f  '  't  and  works  which  oup^ht  to  be  constantly 
represented  to  our  hearers  as  indispensable. 

Further,  in  our  discourses  we  ought  to  explain  to  our  hearers 
the  offices  of  the  Church,  exhibiting  their  scriptural  and  spiri- 
tual excellence  ;  from  tiuu»  to  time  also,  the  j)rimitive  nature  of 
her  constitution  ;  and,  on  the  festivals  and  fasts,  the  striking  and 
particular  olyects  to  be  commemorated  on  those  days,  should  be 
specially  notictd,  and  practically  improved.  This  is  the  more 
incumbcMt  on  us,  as  these  institutions  are  inhr&lt;f&gt;)\'Miited,  or 
/ilstvijanfrd  by  many  j)ersons,  because  they  are  very  little 
acquainted  with  the  subject.  In  these  tinu's  also  of  liberal,  but 
loose  views,  of  high  and  serious  matters  in  Church  and  State,  in 
moi'ality  and  religion,  the  superiority  of  our  genuine  Catholic 
and  Apostolic  i)rinciples  and  practice,  in  most  res]&gt;ects,  as  com- 
pared with  other  Churches,  ought  to  be  plainly  and  strongly  in- 
(Milcated.  I  speak  not  Avith  reference  to  individual  character,  jr 
individual  prei)aration  for  eternity,  nor  with  reference  to  any 
minor  cercunouies  in  themselves  of  an  indifferent  luiture  :  in 
these  points  I  am  averse  to  invidious  comparisons  ;  and,  with 
regard  to  them,  I  am  not  prepared  to  challenge  superiority  for 
ourselves.  I  speak  of  the  general  outline  of  the  plan  of  our 
Zion,and  the  peculiar  and  characteristic  principles  of  her  worship 
and  constitution.  In  doing  this,  I  most  sincerely  deprecate  all 
want  of  charity  ;  but  in  a  just  and  fair  discussion,  we  shall  gain, 
not  lose  by  a  candid  enquiry. 

On  the  subject  of  Public  Worship  I  must  add,  that  a  regular 
order  of  appointment  as  to  place,  and  punctuality  of  attendance 
as  to  time,  are  points  of  importance  highly  requisite  to  the  due 
I)erformance  of  it.  It  is  therefore  desirable  that  each  missionary 
should  not  celebrate  it  at  more  than  two  places,  and  they  not 
many  miles  apart,  on  the  same  Sunday.  In  general,  the  same 
two  places  ought  to  be  worthy  of  preference,  on  the  Sunday,  to 
any  other  plate. 

Tlie  Offices  of  the  Church  claim  our  particular  attention,  but 
the  Umited  time  allotted  to  one  discourse  compels  me  to  make  a 
selection  of  those  which  are  peculiarly  interostiug. 

The  Sacrament  of  Baptism  stands  first  in  injpoitance,  in 
nmny  points  of  view.  It  is  the  threshold  of  our  entrance  into 
the  Church,  and  all  its  privileges.  It  embraces  all  the  condi- 
tions of  the  covenant  which  God  has  vouchsafed  to  make  with 
us,  through  Jesus  Christ,  and  it  seals  them  to  us  by  water  «and 
the  spirit.  A  good  understanding  of  the  letter  and  spirit  of  this 
iSacrament  includes  a  thorougii  knowledge  of  the  principal 
doctrines  and  precepts  of  the  Christian  religion  ;  but  this  know-

persons  arc  imperfectly  grounded  in  the  nature  of  the  ohligu- 
tions  and  \hv  ItencHts  of  the  Christian  ordinances  ;  and  l&gt;ecause 
their  infnrnmtion  respecting  tlie  office  and  order  for  the  adminis- 
tration of  this  Sacrament,  aspreserihed  by  onrCliurch,  is  usually 
verv  deficient.  In  no  other  Church,  in  n^y  opinion,  is  the  insti- 
tr.tfon  so  fully  and  correctly,  according  to  Scripture,  set  forth  as 
ir,  our  othce.  I  know  it  is  objected  to  by  many,  but  this  ])reju- 
dice,  for  if  1  am  right  I  am  justified  in  calling  it  jirejudice,  I 
attribute  to  erroneous  views  on  tlie  subject,  early  imbibed,  and 
subsetiuently  confirmed  by  wrong  but  common  usage.  J  make 
these  observations,  aftt;r  having  once  entert.iined  doubts  myself 
as  to  the  just  propriety  of  our  Baptismal  Servl'-e,  and  after  dili- 
gent inquiry  which  resulted  in  conviction  and  sober  satisfaction. 
It  follows,  that  I  am  anxious  you  should  guard  your  flocks 
against  the  errors  alluded  to  ;  and  that  I  should  counsel  you  to 
be  watchful  and  diligent  in  conveying  to  them  a  compndien- 
sive  view  of  the  obligations  and  privileges  of  this  Sacrament, 
together  w  ith  a  good  understandinj,  &gt;f  the  excellent  exi)ositi&lt;)n 
of  them  offered  us  in  the  service  of  the  Church. 

In  order  to  this,  at  least  for  the  benefit  of  tho  younger  [)art 
of  your  flock,  yon  are  furnished  with  a  Catechism,  or  sumnuiry 
of  faith  and  practice,  to  be  learned  by  all  before  they  come  to  be 
confii-med  by  the  liishoj) ;  and  the  rubrics  and  canons  of  the 
Church  j)rescribe  great  and  constant  attention  to  the  ofl^ice  of 
catechising.  In  tliis  compendium  of  doctrinal  and  jiractical 
Christianity,  the  duties  of  repentance  and  renouncing  the  world, 
of  faith  and  obedience,  of  i)rayer,  and  2&gt;ci"forming  the  Sacra- 
ments, are  laid  down  in  a  i)erspicuous  manner  ;  but  explanaticm 
and  a  further  representation  of  our  Christian  profession  and  vow 
in  Jiaptisni  are  required,  in  order  that  tlsoy  may  be  profitably 
learned.  This  instruction  you  are  ])articularly  called  nj)on  to 
give  ju-eviously  to  the  celebration  of  the  rite  of  Confirmation  in 
your  several  Cures  ;  which  circumstance  of  itself  tends  to  show 
the  im{)ortance  of  the  duty,  and  the  advantage  of  the  rite.  Con- 
firmation is  a  special  provision  in  our  Church,  and  in  most  of 
the  Churches  of  CJhrist,  for  the  accomplishment  of  the  object  I 
have  been  ])ressing  upon  you,  namely,  the  confirming  young 
])ers(  -is  in  the  knowledge  and  practice  of  their  15a])tismal  Cove- 
nant. You  must  exhort  them  to  prepare  for  the  office  by  dili- 
gent study  of  the  subject,  accompanied  with  hearty  prayer  to 
(xod  for  increase  in  the  manifold  gifts  of  grace.  Its  usefulness 
in  these  resj)ects  must  recommend  it  to  our  particular  attention  ; 
and  the  high  estimation  in  which  it  was  held  by  the  Apostles  is 
manifist  from  several  passages  of  Scrij)turc.  St.  Paul  classes 
it  with  the  elements  of  our  religion,  among  the  rudiments  we 
must  learn  pi-eparatory  to  our  striving  to  go  on  to  perfectioTJ. 
[lecoraieetw  it  v.itli  the  first  principles  of  Christianity  in  these 
words  :  Leaving  the  principles  of  the  doctrine  of  Christ,  let  us 
go  »n  unto  j)orfectiou  ;  not  layir.g  again  the  foundation  of  repeii- 
^ince  from  dead  works,  and  of  faitl&gt;  towards  God,  of  the  doc- 
trine of  Baptism,  and  of  laying  on  of  hands,  and  of  resurrection 
of  the  dead,  and  of  eternal  judgment.*

I  have  exhorted  you  to  instruct  your  flocks  in  a  just  and 
comprelu&gt;nsive  view  of  the  Sacrament  of  liaptisui,  and  its 
administration  in  our  CJhurch  ;  and  for  your  assistance  in  the 
fuL  ilmont  of  this  inijiortant  object,  I  have  pointed  out  to  you 
the  advantajie  and  nijcossity  of  jiayiu};  attention  to  the  f,'reat 
duty  of  Catechisiui^  the  youn^  peoph?,  and  preparinj^  them  for 
the  Apostolic  rite  of  Confirmation.  A  thorough  acupiaintance 
with  this  institution  insures  a  good  and  profitalile  knowledge  of 
the  princi[des  of  nu)ral  and  religious  instruction.  Sucli  a  pre- 
paration is  insisted  on  in  our  Clnirch  ;  and  bringing  up  young 
people  in  this  nurture  and  admonition  of  the  Lord  is  required  of 
parents  and  sponsors,  schoolmasters  and  clergymen.  The  edu- 
cation, therefore,  of  the  rising  generation,  is  very  ])articularly 
provided  for,  so  much  so,  that  I  can  not  well  see  how  any  pe»-';un 
acquainted  with  the  spirit  and  precepts  of  the  Bibl'-,  or  the 
fundamental  institutions  of  our  Church,  can  do  OLuerwise  than 
recommend  and  supjiort  the  general  education  of  the  poor,  at 
least  in  the  first  elements  of  learning.  To  you,  my  Reverend 
Brethren,  I  shall  only  observe,  that  the  proper  use  of  our  liturgy, 
and  devout  joining  in  it,  independently  of  other  primary  duties 
connected  with  the  subject,  require  that  every  individual  of  the 
congregation  should  be  able  to  follow  the  clergyman  in  the 
service.  If  any  one  of  my  hearers  entertain  doubts  as  to  the 
expediency  of  universal  education,  I  only  request  him  to  direct 
his  view  and  judgment  to  the  probable  effects  of  a  good  educa- 
tion ;  for  I  am  persuaded  he  will  find,  on  fair  examination,  hi? 
objections  applicable  only  to  a  bad  and  di^cient,  nut  to  a  (jood  and 
religious  one,  which  alone  is  the  instruction  we  desire. 

After  Confirmation  follows  the  duty  of  preparing  for  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper.  No  office  of  our  ministry  is 
more  important,  as  none  offers  so  frequent  and  great  opportunity 
of  giving  godly  instruction,  and  serious  advice.  The  plainness 
of  the  duty  acknowleged  by  all,  and  the  benefits  of  it  so  striking 
and  extensive,  make  every  man  who  has  anv  degree  of  reflec- 
tion, uneasy  under  the  neglect  of  them,  or  in  some  degree  de- 
sirous of  partaking.  Of  this  Avoll-grounded  cause  of  anxiety  a 
Clergyman  should  avail  himself,  by  representing  the  undutiful 
and  unsatisfactory  state  of  every  one  who  is  P'*t  a  Communicant  ; 
by  explaining  the  nature  of  repentance  and  faith,  and  the  offer 
and  promise  of  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit  to  all  who  heartily  seek 
for  them  ;  by  exhorting  his  hearers  to  improve  the  means  of 
grace,  and  of  growing  in  virtue  and  faith,  esi)ecially  that  of 
remembering  our  Lord  in  the  way  positively  commanded,  and 
particularly  blessed  by  him  to  those  who  worthily  receive  this 
holy  Sacrament.  The  subject  includes  all  other  Christian  duties 
besides  many  peculiar  to  itself,  and  is  very  affecting  to  every  one 
who  has  ears  to  hear,  or  a  heart  to  feel.  The  terrors  of  the  Lord 
are  not  to  be  disguised  ;  they  arouse  many  a  careless  sinner ;  '»ut 
the  love  of  Christ  in  living  such  a  life  on  earth  as  he  endured, 
and  dving  such  a  death  as  he  suffered  for  us,  must  constrain  to 
sorrow  for  sin,  and  hatred  of  it,  every  heart  which  is  not  exces- 
sively hardened  by  its  deadening  and  worst  effects — must  move 
to  love  of  God,  and  comfort  and  hope  in  Him,  every  one  who 
contemplates  His  Son  dying  on  the  Cross  for  our  sins,  and  rising

k"*'))  his  conunaudnuMits.*  Dwell  upon  this  p(&gt;worfui  nu«ans  of 
inlluenciug  vour  hearers.  Clirist  was  lifted  uj)  on  the  ('ross  to 
draw  all  uieii  unto  him;  to  draw  them  with  cords  of  a  man, 
with  hands  of  love,t  with  every  huiuan  and  aftectionate  induce- 
ment and  endearment.  Shew  theiu  his  love,  his  agony  and 
hloodv  sweat,  his  cross  and  i)assion,  his  precious  death  and 
burial  his  &lt;dorious  resurrection  and  ascension,  and  tlu»  coming 
of  the  Holy  (ihost,+  by  which  he  delivers  us  from  the  evil  conse- 
quences of  sin,  and  renews  us  in  holiness.  Warn  them  against 
judging  themselves  unworthy  of  everlasting  life  ;§  at  the  same 
time,  instruct  them  that  to  partake  unworthily,  is  to  ])artake  to 
their  condemnation,  not  that  they  incur  a  ho})eiess  condemna- 
tion, for  repentance  and  pardon  are  still  open  to  them,  l)ut  that 
without  repentance  there  is  no  remission  of  sin.  Although  your 
heareis  cannot  be  guilty  of  the  sinful  maimer  of  partaking  of 
the  Corinthians,  yet  the  Lord's  table  ought  to  be  guarded  against 
itnproi)er  communicants,  as  their  admission  brings  a  scandal  on 
the  church,  and  cannot  impart  a  blessing  to  themselves.  Who- 
soever is  habitually  guilty  of  any  sin  is  not  fit  for  the  Communion 
of  our  Lord.  The  rubric  and  exhortations  of  the  liturgy  are  a 
sufficient  guide  for  you  ;  and  I  earnestly  solicit  your  conformity 
to  them.  Spread  ])ef(n'e  your  people  the  table  of  the  Lord  ,  and 
use  your  best  endeavours  to  clothe  them  with  the  mantle  of  his 
ngiiteousness  ;  so  shall  you  and  tliey  be  made  meet  partakt-rs  of 
that  heavenly  feast. 

One  other  office  of  the  Church  I  am  unwilling  to  pass  over 
in  silence,  the  A'isitation  of  the  Sick.  Sickness  is  the  greatest 
and  most  connnon  dispensation  of  (iod,  inflicted  on  man  to  make 
him  sensibb  of  his  weakness  and  inortality,  and  the  vanity  and 
vexations  of  worldly  things  ;  to  raise  his  thoughts  to  another  life, 
and  to  the  consideration  of  judgment  to  come.  It  humbles  liim, 
it  convinces  him  of  his  sins.  Ins  offences  against  God,  his  unfitness 
to  ai)pear  before  the  Great  Searcher  of  hearts,  his  unworthiness 
of  Heaven.  He  wishes  for  a  guide,  a  comforter,  a  deliverer. 
This  is  a  time,  and  a  state,  for  a  brother,  a  neighbour,  to  visit 
him  especially  for  the  minister  of  the  Lord.  Then,  will  his 
pastoral  comfort  and  counsel  be  particularly  valuedand  l)eneficial, 
his  admonitions  to  rei)entance  listened  to,  his  evhortations  to 
faith  hopefully  received.  This  is  an  accepted  t^.-a*,  a  day  of 
succour  and  salvation  to  those  who  improve  the  grace  of  God. 
The  Bible  therefore,  and  the  canon  of  the  Church  direct  you  to 
resort  to  the  sick  person,  to  instruct  and  comfort  him  in  his  dis- 
tress ;  and  this  without  waiting  to  be  called  for :  and  in  your 
ordination  vow,  you  promise  "  to  use  both  public  and  private 
"  monitions  and  exhortations,  as  well  to  the  sick  as  to  the  whole, 
"  within  your  Cures,  as  need  shall  require,  and  occasion  shall  be 
"  given."||  Lose  not  this  precious  occasion  of  drawing  sinners  to 
repentance  and  pardon,  to  faith,  hope,  and  love,  love  of  God,  and 
thankful  reflection  upon  all  his  works  and  dealings  towards  man- 
kind. Shew  him,  the  sick  man,  that  God  rules  over  all  things, 
that  his  gove^-nmeut  is  just,  his  Avill  perfect  for  the  good  of  all

creation,  therefore,  that  ho  chastens  him  for  his  profit,  for  the 
good  of  his  soul,  for  the  increase  of  his  riches  and  reward  in

not  you  be  tlie  messenj:(ers  to  all  within  your  reacli  and  j&gt;ower  ? 
Praise  God  for  the  office  ;  and  cheerfully  fulfil  it.  Suffer  not 
vour  de-iponding  brother  to  exclaim  :  Is  there  no  balm  in  (lilead  ; 
IS  there  no  i^hysician  there  ?  why  then  is  not  the  health  of  the 
daughter  of  my  people  recovered  ?*  Pour  oil  into  the  bleeding 
wounds  jind  souls  of  your  sick  peojde  ;  conu)  ajifain  and  again  to 
them  ;  be  their  physicians  ;  be  instruments  in  God's  hand  of 
good  to  tliem,  of  glory  to  him  ;  and  be  thankful  for  such  an  op- 
portunity of  profit  and  usefulness  to  your  own  immediate  congre- 
gations and  to  his  Church  at  large.  More  I  need  not  say  ;  yon 
are  I  trust,  vc a  |y  and  determined,  like  the  good  Samaritan,  to 
execute  your  !•  b;mr  of  love,  at  once  with  tenderness  and  zeal. 

From  the  consideration  of  public  or  official  duties,  I  j)roceed 
to  making  a  few  i-emarks  on  the  importance  of  your  individual 
character  and  th(&gt;  effects  which  yourexample  is  fitted  to  produce 
on  your  flocks  and  hearers.  But  as  I  have  already  detained  yon 
so  long,  I  must  in  a  great  measure  leave  this  part  of  my  duty  to 
a  future  oi)portunity. 

Jt  is  obvious  that  unless  your  own  conduct  coi'respond  with 
your  counsel,  public  and  private,  and  your  life  with  your  doctrine 
and  sermons,  the  authority  of  what  you  say,  the  efficacy  of  your 
admonitions  will  be  greatly  diminished, — almost  done  away  ;  in- 
deed, with  some  hearers,  not  only  your  own  sincerity,  but  even 
the  very  truth  itself  of  the  word,  which  you  preach,  will  be  called 
in  question.  Your  good  example,  therefore,  in  all  the  duties  and 
concerns  of  life  is  most  powerful  in  its  effects  on  all  who  see  and 
hear  you.  You  in  particular,  must  be  an  example  of  the  be- 
lievers, in  word,  in  conversation,  in  charity,  in  spirit,  in  faith,  in 
purity.f  You  must  adorn  the  doctrine  of  God  our  Saviour  in  all 
thingSjJ  and  be  an  ornament  as  well  as  a  pillar  to  the  Church. 
Thus,  you  will  recommend  the  word  of  life  as  well  as  yourselves, 
and  gain  some,  who  otherwise  would  be  deaf  to  your  exhortations, 
and  inaccessible  to  your  influence.  You  must  abstain  from  en- 
tering into  pursuits  of  business,  or  of  profit  beyond  what  is  plainly 
expedient  for  the  good  of  your  people,  or  the  comfort  of  your 
families  :  and  you  must  not  sacrifice  valuable  time  and  talents  in 
giving  way  to  the  temptations  of  company  or  of  amusements, 
which  Avould  interfere  wjih  paying  due  attention  to  the  high 
offices  of  your  calling,  and  with  the  character  of  usefulness,  dili- 
gence, and  devotedness  to  the  service  of  God  and  your  people, 
which  you  should  be  zealous  to  maintain.  In  this  country,  es- 
pecially, it  is  difficult  to  enter  into  concerns  of  business,  or  of 
profit,  without  encountering  unlooked  for  trouble  or  failure  ;  and 
with  regard  to  amusement,  general  opinion,  I  would  say,  makes 
peculiar  moderation  and  restraint  incumbent  ji  you.  Although 
there  are  bounds  to  the  duty  of  not  offending  your  weak  brother, 
yet,  I  am  persuaded,  you  do  not  wish  to  narrow  them  to  ques-

ronsider  vour  hi^^h  vocation,  your  cure  of  souls,  yt  .ir  reward  in 
heaven.     Vou  are  watciimen  to  warn  peojjle  of  their  sins  ;  am- 
bassadors for  Christ,  to  pray  them  in  his  stead,  be  ye  reconciled 
to  God  ;t  pastors  to  lead  them   to  the  fountains  of  everlasting 
life,  to  gather  tliem  into  the  fold  of  Christ,  to  i)resent   them  to 
liiiii  at  his  coniin!^-,  tiien  to  be  yimr  joy  and  crown  of  rejoicing  it 
and,  hnally,  to   he  joined  witii  them  in  everlasting  worship, 
praise,  and  glory,  in  heaven.     Consider  the  value  and  immorta- 
lity of  souls  ;  tlieir  life  and  happiness,  or  death  and  nusery, — 
eternal  ;  the  death  of  Christ,  his  sorrow,  such  as  was  no  man's 
sorrow,  for  their  sakes  ;  their  blood  recpiired  at  your  hands,  if 
vou  do  not  warn  them  of  their  danger,  and  tet?'  ;    them  their 
duty.     Then,  the  cares  of  this  world  will  not  occupy  your  hearts 
and  minds  ;  the  vanities  of  this  life  will  not  divert  your  thoughts 
nor  draw  you  oflP  from  the  realities  and  eternity  of  th(!  next. 
Your  care  will  be  to  win  souls  to  Christ  :  to  be  watchful  over 
them  as  one  that  must  give  an  account ;  to  preach  Christ  Jesus, 
the  Lord,  and  yourselves  their  servants  for  Jesus'  sake  :§  your 
j&gt;leiisure  will  be  to  conduct  them  in  the  course  of  righteousness 
and  religion,  her  ways  of  pleasantness,  and  her  paths  of  peace  ;|| 
and  your  reward  will  be  turning  many  to  rigiiteonsness,  and 
shining  as  the  stars  for  ever  and  ever.H     Yon  will  perfomi  the 
public  services  of  the  Church,  and  her  offices,  in  the  house  of 
God,  and  in  private,  to  the  sick,  :ts  well  as  the  whole,  with  the 
spirit,  and  with  the  understanding  also,  in  tlie  form  and  power 
of  Godliness  ;  and  your  people  will  catch  their  spirit,  partake  of 
tlieir  power,  and  rise  and  sit  together  with  yon   in   heavenly 
places  in  Christ  Jesus.**     You  will  instruct  the  lambs  of  your 
flock  in  the  principles  of  the  doctrine  of  Christ,  lead  them  on  to 
confirmation  in  their  duty,  and  in  the  promises  of  God  ;  and 
so  prepare  them  to  be  fed  with  the  bread  of  life,  to  fulfil  the 
Sacraments  of  our  Lord,  to  walk  in  truth,  and  finally  to  be  car- 
ried by  the  angels  into  Abraham's  bosom,  and  to  sit  down  with 
him  in  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven.     Thus  you  will  be  an  example 
of  ihe  holy  properties  and  praiseworthy  i)ractices  which  you 
precL'li  to  others,  going  before  them  in  the  ways  which  they  are 
to  follow,  holding  forth  the  word  of  life  in  your  conversation,  as 
well  as  in  your  doctrine.    Thus,  you  will  make  full  i)roof  of 
your  ministry,  save  yourselves,  and  those  that  hear  you,  and 
finish  your  course  with  joy.ft     Your  harvest  will  be  gi'eat ;  and 
if  sometimes,  in  this  diversified  field  of  human  life,  you  sow  in 
tears,  yet  you  shall  reap  in  joy.     He  that  goeth  forth  and  weep- 
eth,  bearing  precious  seed,  shall  doubtless  come  again  with  re- 
joicing, bringing  his  sheaves  with  him-JJ

By  the  memory  of  him  over  whom  we  have  mourned —

and  to  the  Church  of  God  in  tiiis  Diocese,  yea,  to  all  Christian 
people  dispersed  throughout  the  world  ;  for  thr  prayers  of  the 
righteous  avail  much.  I  promise  you  mine,  anu  my  assistance  to 
the  best  of  my  power.  May  God  give  the  increase.  May  we 
persevere  to  plant  and  water,  and  ajjprove  ourselves  as  faithful 
labourers  in  the  vineyard  of  our  master.  May  we  be  examples 
to  the  flock  of  God  which  is  a'aong  us,  that  when  the  chief  Shep-

TALE  OF  LAKE  HURON, 

AN    UrPEH   CANADIAN    TAI.E. 

From  thr  Ticfort  of  the  Sor'nii/  at  Toronto,  f^/&gt;j&gt;cr  Canada,  cttaUif/ud 
in  UJ^tO,  "  For  cinllsiiKj  and  cunnrtiinj  the  Ivdian.i,  and  ]&gt;ropa- 
gathiij  the  (So^pil  amouijd  the  di.&lt;t(tiite  Mthrs  in  Uj&gt;j&gt;ir  Canada,  of 
ichirli  the  liii^ho/j  of  Quehec  was  Prcmlent. 

In  th(&gt;  wiiitor  of  UKi2,  I  was  led,  partly  by  business  and 
partly  hy  tlio  novelty  of  the  onterj)ris  •,  to  walk  fronj  the  Indian 
estahlishnient  at  Coldwater,  on  Lake  Huron,  to  the  Sault  St. 
Marie,  m\  the  Kiver  Severn,  which  joins  that  Lake  with  the 
Narrows  of  liake  Sinieoe,  a  distance  of  about  four  hundred 
miles.  The  Lake  was  well  frozen,  and  the  ice  moderately 
covered  with  snow  ;  with  the  assistance  of  snow  shoes,  we  were 
enabled  to  travel  the  distance  of  fifty  miles  a  day  ;  but  my 
business  not  requirinn;' any  exj)edition,  1  was  tempted  to  linj^er 
auion&lt;j;  the  thousand  islands  of  Lake  Huron.  I  h()p(ul  to  ascer- 
tain sonu'  facts  with  regard  to  the  real  mode  of  life  of  the 
Indians  fre(iuenting  the  north  side  of  the  lake.  AVith  this  view 
I  made  a  ])()int  of  visiting;  evei-y  wi&lt;j;wam  that  we  approached, 
anil  could,  if  it  wore  my, present  purpose,  detail  many  distressinj; 
])ictures  of  extreme  misery  and  destitution.  Hun&lt;^er,  tilth,  aiul 
i/,Miorance,  with  an  entire  absence  of  all  knowled^^e  of  a  Supreme 
Hein&lt;,%  here  reif&gt;;n  triumphant. 

Near  the  close  of  a  lon^  and  fatiguinj;  day,  my  Indian  p^nido 
came  ou  the  recent  track  of  a  sinji^le  Indian,  and  anxious  to 
jdcase  me,  jmrsued  it  to  the  head  of  a  very  deep  bay.  \Ve])assed 
two  of  those  hole.s  in  the  ice  which  the  Indians  use  for  fishing, 
and  at  one  of  tliem  noticed,  from  the  quantity  of  blood  on  the 
snow,  that  the  sjjcar  had  lately  done  considerable  execution. 
At  a  very  short  distance  from  the  shore,  the  track  led  us  past 
the  remains  of  a  wit^wum,  adjoining  to  which  we  observed  a 
larj^e  canoe,  and  a  small  hunting  canoe,  V)oth  carefully  laid  up 
for  the  winter.  After  a  considerable  ascent,  a  narrow  winding 
path  brought  u«  into  a  deej)  hollow,  about  four  hundred  yard.-* 
from  the  l)ay.  Here,  surrounded  on  every  side  by  hills,  on  the 
nuirgin  of  one  of  tlie  smallest  inland  laKes,  we  came  to  a  wig- 
wam, the  smoke  from  wliich  shewed  lis  tluit  it  was  o(  cupied. 
The  path  for  a  considerable  distance  was  lined  on  both  sides  by 
billets  of  firewood,  and  a  blanket,  cleaner  than  usual  among 
Indians,  suspended  before  the  entrance,  gave  me  at  the  very  first 
a  very  favourable  oj)inion  of  the  inmates.  I  noticed  on  the 
right  hand  a  dog  train,  and  on  the  left  two  pair  of  snow  shoes 
and  two  barrels  of  salt  fish.  The  wigwam  was  of  the  square 
form,  and  so  large,  that  I  was  sui-prised  to  find  it  occupied  by 
two  Indians  only — a  young  man  and  his  wife. 

We  were  soon  made  wxdcome,  and  1  had  leisure  to  look 
round  mo  in  admiration  of  the  comfort  displayed  in  the  arrange- 
ment of  the  interior.  A  covering  of  the  fresh  branches  of  tlie 
young  hendock  was  neatly  sj)read  all  around.  In  the  centre  «)f 
the  right  hand  side  as  we  entered,  the  master  of  the  lodge  was 
seated  on  a  large  mat  ;  his  wife  occupied  the  station  at  his  left 
hand  ;  good  and  clean  mats  were  spread  for  myself  and  my 
guide — my   own   being  opposite   the   entrance,   and   my  guide

it,  a  mat  filled  with  tin  dishes  and  wooden  spoons  of  Indian 
manufacture  ;  ahovt^  that  were  several  p(n'tions  of  female  dresn 
ornamental  Ii^^^'^mU'^'s,  two  showy  sh;iw!s,  \e.  ;  a  small  chest 
and  a  haLf  were  hehind  Ikm*  upon  the  ;;round.  At  the  hactk  of  tho 
Indian  wore  Hus|)ended  two  spear  heads  of  three  pronj^'s  each, 
liu  American  riHe,  an  I'in;,'iiHli  fowlin;i;-piece,  and  an  Indian  Chief 
pioci',  with  shot  and  bullet  ])()uches,  and  two  powder  horns  ; 
there  were  also  a  hiirhly  ornamented  capuchin,  and  a  ]&gt;air  of 
now  blanket  le;,'f,'in,i(s.  The  corner  was  occupied  by  a  small  red 
])aint(id  cln^st  ;  a  inocoah  of  suijar  was  jdaeed  in  the  corner  on 
my  ri;,'ht  hand,  and  a  barrel  of  Hour,  half  empty,  on  the  rif^ht 
hand  of  my  Indian  /^niide.  In  the  centre,  as  usual,  we  had  a 
bri;,'ht  bla/in^'  fire,  over  which  three  kettles  pive  jiromise  of 
one  of  tho  comforts  of  weary  travellei's.  Our  host  had  arrived 
but  a  few  minutes  before  us,  and  was  busied  in  pullin&lt;?  off  his 
mocassins  and  blankets  when  w&lt;}  enterejl.  We  had  scarcely 
time  to  remove  our  leijcf^injifs  and  chanj^e  our  mocassins,  jire- 
paratory  to  a  full  enjoyment  of  the  fire,  when  the  Indian's  wifo 
was  prej)ared  to  set  before  us  a  [)lentiful  mess  of  boiliul  fish  ; 
this  was  followed  in  a  short  time  by  soup  nuide  of  deer  flesh 
and  Indian  corn,  and  our  repast  t  ■rminated  with  hot  cakes, 
baken  in  the  as!ies,  in  addition  to  the  tea  supplied  from  my  own 
stores. 

Before  dayliii^ht  on  tho  following  mornin&lt;if,  wo  wore  about 
to  sot  out,  but  could  not  be  allowed  to  dej)art  without  again 
partaking  of  refreshment.  Boiled  and  broiled  fish  were  set 
before  us,  and  to  my  extreme  surprise  the  young  Indian,  before 
partaking  of  it,  knelt  to  pray  aloud.  His  i)rayer  was  short  and 
fervent,  and  without  that  whining  tone  in  which  I  had  been 
accustomed  to  hear  the  Indians  address  the  Deity.  It  appeared 
to  combine  the  manUness  and  humility  which  one  would  natu- 
rally expect  to  find  in  an  address  spoken  direct  from  the  heart, 
and  not  got  up  for  theatrical  effect. 

On  taking  our  de])arture,  I  tried  to  scan  the  countenance  of 
our  host,  and  1  flatter  myself  I  could  not  mistake  the  marks  of 
unfeigned  pleasure  whicli  he  enjoyed  in  the  thoughts  of  having 
exercised  the  feelings  of  hospitality,  mixed  with  a  little  pride  in 
the  display  of  the  riches  and  comforts  of  his  wigwam. 

You  may  be  well  assured  I  did  not  omit  the  opportunity  of 
div5:;g  into  the  secret  of  all  his  comfort  and  prosperity. 

It  could  not  escape  observation  that  here  was  real  civiliza- 
tion, and  I  anxiously  sought  for  some  explanation  of  the  differenc* 
between  this  Indian  and  his  neighbours.  The  story  was  soon 
told.  He  had  been  brought  up  at  the  British  settlement  on 
Drummond  Island,  where,  xchen  a  child,  he  had  in  frequent  con- 
versations, but  in  no  studied  form,  heard  the  principles  of  the 
Christian  religion  explained,  and  he  had  been  told  to  observe  the 
Sabbath,  and  to  pray  to  the  Almighty.  Industry  and  prudence  had 
been  frequently  explained  and  enjoined,  and,  above  all  things, 
an  abhorrence  of  ardent  spirits.     Under  the  influence  of  this  whole-

Shall  I  (says  tlu^  Hoporter)  lift  the  sam(&gt;  blanket  after  tho 
iapso  of  «'ij,ditoen  months  ?  Tho  s(&gt;cond  sumiui'r  has  arrived 
since  my  last  visit;  the  wij^wamon  the  lakeshore,  the  fit  residence 
of  sununer,  is  unoccupied  the  Hre  is  still  burning'  in  the  wiirwani 
of  winter;  bnt  th(&gt;  situation  which  had  Wiirmth  and  ((uiet  to 
recommend  it  at  that  season  when  col&lt;l  is  our  greatest  enemy,  is 
now  ^flootny,  dark,  and  comfortless, 

\Vonderin&lt;,'  what  could  havc^  induced  my  Indian  fVii-mls  to 
put  np,  at  such  a  season,  with  the  melancholy  of  the  deep  and 
din&lt;fy  forest,  instead  of  tin;  briijht  s})arklin&lt;;-  of  the  sunlit  wave, 
I  hastein'(l  to  enter.  How  sad  the  (dianye  !  'I'here  was  indeed 
the  same  Indian  u;irl  that  I  had  left  healthy,  cheerftil,  contented, 
and  happy  ;  but  whiskey,  hun&lt;,'er,  destitution,  tind  «listress  of 
mind,  had  marked  her  countenance  with  the  furrows  of  premu- 
turo  old  aj^'e.  An  infant,  whoso  aspect  was  little  better  than  its 
mother's,  was  han|^in&lt;^  at  her  breast,  half  dressed  and  filthy. 
Kvery  part  of  the  wijfwam  was  ruinous  and  dirty  ;  all  tin?  useful 
and  ornantental  furniture,  which  ei;;hteen  months  before  had 
seemed,  a  source  of  pride  and  pleasure,  was  ^^one,  and,  with  tho 
solitary  exception  of  ji  single  kettle,  all  was  dreary,  desolate,  and 
empty.  Not  one  sinji^le  article  of  furniture,  clothiny-,  or  i)rovi.sion 
remained.  J[er  husband  had  &lt;|fone  out  in  the  morning— as  he 
said  to  L'o  and  lish — and  she  had  never  moved  from  the  spot  in 
which  he  left  her  ;  this  I  thon^jht  stranf,'e,  as  his  dilapidated 
canoe  ami  spear  were  on  the  beach.  In  a  short  time  he  returned, 
hut  brouf,dit  no  food.  He  had  indeed  set  out  to  fish,  but  had  lain 
down  to  sleep  in  the  bush,  and  had  been  awakened  by  the  bark- 
ing of  his  half  fanjished  doj)^  on  our  arrival.  Instead  of  the  manly 
fi&lt;rure  I  had  j)arted  from  him,  lie  api)eared  worn  down  and  help- 
less both  in  body  and  mind,  and  seated  himself  in  listless  silence 
in  his  2)lace  in  the  wifrwam. 

Prodiicinuf  pork  and  flour  from  my  travelling  stores,  I  re- 
quested the  wife  to  cook  them.  They  were  prepared,  and  I 
looked  anxionsly  at  the  Indian,  expectinj,'  to  hear  hisaocnstomed 
prayer,  by  whitdi  I  was  so  forcibly  struck  on  my  former  visit — 
but  all  was  silence ;  he  did  not  move  ;  I  therefore  commenced 
to  ask  a  blessing ;  judo^e  of  my  astonishment  to  observe  him 
immediately  rise  and  leave  the  wii^wam  ! 

His  wife  and  child  joined  us,  liowever,  in  partakin&lt;j  of  the 
food,  wliich  they  ate  with  allthevoraciousnes  of  famished  beings. 
In  a  little  time  the  Indian  returned,  and  immediately  lay  down. 
My  curiosity  was  excited,  and  I  longed  to  know  the  cause  of  this 
dire,  inexplicable  mystery  ;  and  though  anxious  not  to  distress

On  the  o|K'nin;;  of  thf  spriiif;  of  MV.VA,  tin*  Indian,  havinj;  ^'ot 
ft  Hufficit'iicv  of  fur  for  his  purposti,  snt  oft*  to  a   distant    trading 
post   tr&gt;  make   his  purchase.     'rin»  trader  presented   him  with  a 
plu^  of  toltacco  and   a  pip(^  on  his  entrance,  and  oftered    hint  n 
H^hiNs  of  whislcey,  which  he  civilly  hut  resolutely  d«'elined.     The 
trader  was  occupi&lt;'d  with  otiior  custonu'rs,  hut  s(»on  noticed  tho 
rosp(M*tal)le  collection  of  furs  in  tlu^  pack  of  the  poor  Indian  ;  and 
this  tiDiiiiiiiilli/  ('hri!it'i&lt;ui  trader  niarK(&gt;d  thetn  for  his  own.     Tho 
poor  Indian  njust  he  his  victim  :  tor  not  expecting;  to  Ik'  ahht  to 
imposimpon  him  unless  he  made  him  drunk,  he  determined  that 
what  he  could  not  accomplish  opcMily,  he  wiudd  still  accompli.sh 
by  indirect  means.     Ah  soon  as  the  ston;  was  cleared  of  other 
cuNtomers,  he  entered  into  conversation  with  tin*  Indian,  and 
invited  him  to  join  him  in  a  ^lass  of  cid(&gt;r,  which  he  nnhesitatin^dy 
(free  from  f^uile  himself,  ho  had  no  suspicions)  accej)tod.     The 
c'lili'r  vii»  mliiil  irilh  hi'dndy,  and  soon  J&gt;e;fan  to  aft'ect  the  mind  of 
the  j)oor  Indian  ;   a  second  and  a  third  ^\ush  wt're  administored 
hy    this  Christian  demon,  and   tho   Indian   hecame   completely 
intoxicatcMl.     In  this  state  the  trader  &lt;leiilt  with  him  ;  hut  it  was 
not  at  the  first  that  even  tho  well  dru^'jijed  drauyfht  which  he  ha&lt;l 
taken  could  overcome  the  lessons  of  prudence  hy  which   ho  had 
been  accustomed  to   p;uide  hims(df.     Me  parted  with  only  ono 
Hkin  ;  the  trader,  therefore,  was  con»pell(Ml  to  continue  his  diabo- 
lical contrivances,  which  he  did  with  s»u*h  j^ood   effect,  that  for 
three  weeks  the  Indian  remained  tsitiiifi;,  drinkinj'', and  sleeping 
in  his  store.     At  len^'th  all  the  fur  was  sold,  and  tlie  Indian  re- 
turned homo — with  only  a  few  ribands  and  paltry  beads,  and  a 
bottle  of  whiskey.     The  evil  example  of  the  husband,  added  to 
vexation  of  jnind,  broke  the  resolution  of  the  wife,  and  she  too 
partook  of  the  accursed  liquor.  From  this  time  (hoin&lt;j;  far  beyond 
the  roach  of  any  helping;  hand  stretched  out  to  save  tluun)  there 
was  no  chanfje.     The  resolution  of  th(&gt;  Indian  once  broken,  his 
pride  of  spirit,  and  consequently  his  firmness,  is  ^one  ;  he  be- 
came a  confirmed  drinker  ;  his  wife's  and  his  own  ornamental 
dresses,  and  at  lenj^th  all  the  furniture  of  his  wiijwam,  even  the 
guns  and  traps  u])on  which  his  huntinf»  depended,  wore  all  sold 
at  the  store — for  whiskey.    When  I  arrived  they  had  been  two 
days  withont  food,  and  tho  Indian  had  not  energy  to  save  himself 
and  family  from  starvation. 

All  the  arguments  v  hich  occurred  to  me  I  made  use  of  to 
convince  him  of  his  folly,  Jtnd  to  induce  him  even  now  to  return 
to  his  own  old  paths,  to  begin  life  anew,  and  redeem  the  cha- 
racter which  had  been  to  him  before  an  unfailing  source  of  j)ride 
and  happiness.  He  heard  me  in  silence.  I  felt  that  I  should  be 
distressing  them  by  remaining  all  night,  and,  therefore!,  with  a 
heavy  heart,  prepared  to  set  out  again,  grieved  and  disa])j)ointed 
at  the  disastrous  change  I  have  witnessed.  Before  I  departed  1 
gave  the  Indian  a  dollar,  desiring  him  to  purchase  food  with  it 
at  the  nearest  store,  and  promising  shortly  to  sec  him  again. 

I  had  not  proceeded  far  on  my  journey,  when  I  reflected 
that  by  staying  with  them  for  the  night,  and  in  the  morning

Soon  after  my  arrival  in  the  State  of  North  Carolina,  I  was 
informed  of  an  isolated  Settlement  at  a  considerable  distance 
from  the  j)lace  of  my  residence.  Its  original  elements  were 
Einiij,'rants  from  New  En«i;land  :  a  father  and  his  five  sons,  who 
with  their  wives  and  littla  cliildren,  had  about  thirty  years 
before  become  sojourners  in  the  heart  of  one  of  the  deepest 
Carolinian  solitudes.  They  purchased  a  tract  of  wild  swamp- 
encircled  land.  TJiis  they  subjected  to  cultivation,  and  by 
unremitting  industry,  rendered  it  adequate  to  their  subsistence 
and  comfort.  The  sons,  and  the  son's  sons  had  in  their  turn 
become  fathers  of  families,  so  that  the  population  of  this  singular 
little  spot  comprise  four  generations.  They  were  described  an 
i.'onstituting  a  peaceful  and  virtuous  community,  with  a  govern'

meut  among  themselves  purely  ()atriorchal.  Secitided  from  the 
blessings  and  privileges  of  public  worship,  it  was  said,  that  a 
deep  sense  of  religion,  influencing  tie  heart  and  conduct,  had 
been  preserved  by  statedly  lissembliig  on  the  oabbath,  and 
reading  the  bcriptures,  with  the  Jjifirgy  of  the  Church  of 
England.  The  pious  ancestor  of  the  colony,  whose  years  now 
exceed  fourscore,  had  at  their  removal  to  this  Hermitage, 
established  his  eldest  m  as  lay-reader.  This  simple  ministra- 
tion, aided  by  holy  e^umple,  has  so  shared  the  blessing  from 
heaven,  that  all  the  members  of  this  miniature  commonwealth 
held  fast  the  hop&lt;i  and  faith  of  the  gospel. 

I  was  desirous  of  visiting  this  peculiar  people,  and  of  ascer- 
taining whether  such  glorious  and  precious  fruits  could  derive 
nourishment  from  so  simple  a  root.  A  journey  which  I  had  to 
make  across  that  section  of  the  country  afforded  me  the  wished 
for  opportunity.  I  rv^solved  therefore  so  to  contrive  my  journey 
aa  tO  be  witness  to  their  Sunday  devotions,  and  with  the  earliest 
dawn  of  that  consecrated  day,  I  left  the  house  of  a  friend  where 
1  had  lodged  the  preceding  night,  being  furnished  by  him  with 
the  requisite  directions  for  my  solitary  and  circuitous  route. 

The  bri,:j;htness  and  heat  of  a  summer  sun  began  to  glow 
oppressively  ere  I  turned  from  the  haunts  of  men,  and  plunged 
deep  IlLo  the  opaque  recesses  of  the  forest.  Towering  among 
shades  which  almost  excluded  the  light  of  heaven,  rose  the 
majestic  pines,  t»ie  glory  and  wealth  of  North  Cr  roliiia.  Some 
like  the  palms,  those  princes  of  the  east,  in  ancient  days  the 
sacred  emblem  of  Jerusalem,  reared  a  proud  column  of  fifty  feet, 
ere  the  branches  shot  forth  their  heavenward  cone.  With  their 
dark  verdure,  mingled  the  pale  and  beautiful  efflorescence  of  the 
white  poplar,  like  the  light  interfacings  of  sculpture  in  some 
antique  awe-int  piring  temple  ;  while  thousands  upon  thousands 
of  birds  poured  their  anthem  of  praise  to  the  divine  architect, 
from  the  dark  cool  archeo  of  this  lovely  wilderness. 

The  sun  was  high  in  the  heavens  before  I  arrived  at  the 
morass — the  bulwark  thrown  by  nature  around  this  little  city  of 
the  desert.  Alighting  from  my  horse,  I  led  him  over  the  rude 
bridges  of  logs,  which  were  placed  over  the  pools  and  ravines, 
until  our  footing  once  more  rested  upon  firm  earth.  An  expanse 
of  arable  woodland  soon  became  visible,  and  wreaths  of  smoke 
came  lightly  curling  through  the  trees,  offering,  as  it  werfr,  a 
welcome  to  the  weary  stranger.  A  cluster  or  cottages  then 
cheered  the  eye — so  contiguously  situated  that  the  blast  of  a 
horn,  or  even  the  call  of  a  shrill  voice  i'  ight  easily  convene  all 
the  inhabitants.  To  the  central  and  largest  building  I  at  once 
directed  my  steps.  Approaching,  I  found  the  window  was  open, 
and  heard  a  distinct  manlj'  voice,  pionouiicing  the  solemn  invo- 
cation— "  By  thine  agony  and  bloody  sweat — by  thy  cros?  and 
**  passion — by  thy  precious  death  and  burial — by  thy  glorious 
**  resurrection  and  ascension — ^and  by  the  coming  of  the  Holy 
"  Ghost" — the  response  rose  fully  and  devoutly  in  accents  of 
manhood,  and  the  softer  tones  of  the  mothers  and  their  children. 

Standing  motionless  that  I  might  not  disturb  the  devotion 
of  the  worshippers,  I  had  a  full  view  of  the  lay  reader.  He  was 
a  man  six  feet  in  height,  muscular  r.nd  ^e)l  proportioned,  with

a  hoad  beautifully  formed  ;  from  whose  crown  time  had  be^uu 
to  shred  tlie  luxuriance  of  its  raven  locks.  Unconscious  of  the 
presence  of  a  stranger,  he  supposed  that  no  eye  regarded  liim 
save  that  of  llini  who  "  sittetli  upon  the  circle  of  the  heavens  ;" 
kneeling  around  him  were  his  "  brethicn  according  to  the 
"  flesh"— u  inunerons  and  attentive  congregation.  At  liis  right 
hand  was  the  patriarch — vail,  somewhat  emaciated,  yet  not 
bowed  down  with  years,  his  white  hair  combed  smoothlv  over 
his  temples,  and  slightly  curling  on  his  neck.  Gathered  near 
him  were  his  children  ar.a  his  cliildrenV^  children.  liis  blood 
was  in  the  veins  o  ahnost  e  3ry  worshipper.  Mingled  with  the 
forms  that  evince  I  the  ravages  of  time  and  toil,  were  the  bright 
shininii;  locks  of  youth,  and  the  rosy  brow  oi  childhood  bowed 
low  in  sui)plication  ;  even  the  infant,  with  hiished  lip,  seemed 
to  legard  a  scene  where  there  was  no  wandering  glance.  In- 
voluntarily I  said  to  myself,  as  my  heart  swelled  with  emotion 
iit  what  1  saw,  "shall  not  this  be  a  family  in  heaven  1"  In  the 
closing  asj)irations,  "  O  lamb  of  God,  that  takest  away  the  sins  of 
"  the  world  have  mercy  on  us."  The  solemn  voice  of  the  patriarch 
was  distinctly  heard,  with  sti'ong  and  affecting  emphasis.  After 
a  pause  of  silent  adoration  all  a:  ose  from  their  knees,  and  I 
entered  the  pious  and  happy  circle.  "  I  am  a  minister  of  the 
"  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ,  1  said  as  I  enterr^d,  and  I  come  to  greet 
"  and  bless  you  in  the  name  of  the  Lord." 

The  aged  patriarch,  grasping  my  hand,  gazed  on  lae  for  a 
few  moments  with  intense  earnestness — a  welcome  such  as  words 
could  never  utter  was  written  on  his  brow. 

"  Thirty  and  two  years  has  my  dwelling  been  in  this  forest — 
"  hitherto  no  man  of  God  has  visited  our  lonely  dwellings — praised 
"  be  his  holy  name,  who  hath  put  it  into  thine  heart  to  seek  out 
"  these  few  sheep  in  the  wilderness.  Secluded  as  we  are,  from 
"  the  privilege  of  worshipping  God  in  his  temple,  we  thus  as- 
"  semble  every  sabbath  to  read  his  blessed  book  and  to  pray  unto 
"  him  in  the  words  of  the  liturgv  of  our  fathers.  Thus  by  his 
"  gi-ace  we  ha\  e  been  preserved  i  ova.  '  forgetting  the  Lord  who 
"  bought  us  and  lightly  esteeming  the  rock  of  our  salvation.*  " 

The  exercises  of  that  day  are  v^eeply  engraved  on  the  tablet 
of  my  memory — "are  they  not  also  written  on  the  record  of  theMost 
High,"  surely  a  blessing  entered  into  ir.y  own  soul,  as  I  beheld 
the  faith,  and  strengthened  the  hope  of  these  t?*ue  hearted  and 
devoted  discijdes.  Like  him,  whose  slumbers  at  Bethel  weio 
visited  by  the  white  winged  company  of  Heaven,!  was  constrained 
to  say,  "  surely,  the  Lord  is  in  this  jjlace  and  I  knew  it  not." 

At  the  request  of  the  patriarch  I  administered  the  ordinance 
of  baptism,  it  was  received  with  ihe  most  affecting  demonstration 
of  solemnity  and  gratitude.  The  sacred  services  of  the  di^y  were 
protracted  till  the  setting  of  the  pun — yet  all  were  alike  unwilling 
to  depart — it  was  to  them  a  high  and  alas  !  a  rare  festival.  When 
about  to  separate  the  venerable  patriarch  introduced  me  to  all 
his  cliildren — each  seemed  anxious  to  press  my  hand  ;  and  even 
the  children  expressed  by  affectionate  glances,  their  love  and 
reverence  for  one  who  ministered  at  the  altar  of  God. 

The  Almighty,  said  the  vf.nsrable  man,  hath  smiled  on  thehe 
i^iibes  born  in   the  deserts.    I  came  liither  with  my  sons  and

their  companiun^,  and  their  blessed  mother  who  is  gone  to  rest. 
God  liatli  given  us  families  as  a  flock.  We  earn  our  bread  with 
toil  and  with  patience.  For  the  short  interval  of  labour  we  have 
a  school,  where  our  little  ones  learn  the  rudiments  of  knowledge, 
Our  only  books  of  instruction  are  the  Bible  and  Prayer  Book. 

At  a  given  signal  they  rose  and  stuig,  when  about  de])arting 
to  their  separate  abodes — "  Glory  be  to  God  in  the  highest,  and 
"  on  earth  Peace  and  Goodwill  towards  men,"  Never  by  the 
pomp  of  measui-ed  melody  was  my  spirit  so  stirred  within  me,  as 
when  that  rustic,  yet  tuneful  choir,  surrounding  the  wliite  haired 
father  of  them  all,  breathed  out  in  the  forest  sanctuary,  "  Thou 
"  that  takost  away  the  sins  of  the  world,  have  mercy  on  us." 
The  following  morning  I  called  on  every  family  and  was  much 
delighted  with  the  domestic  order,  economy,  and  concord,  that 
prevailed.  Careful  improvement  of  time,  and  moderate  desires, 
seemed  uniformly  to  produce  among  them  the  fruits  of  a  blame- 
less life  and  con&gt;^ersation.  They  conducted  me  to  their  school, 
its  teacher  Avas  a  grand-daughter  of  the  lay  reader.  Slie  possess- 
ed a  sweet  countenance  and  gentle  manners,  and  with  character- 
istic sweetness  and  simplicity,  employed  herself  at  the  spinning 
wheel  when  not  absorbed  in  the  labours  of  instruction.  Most  of 
her  pupils  read  intelligibly,  and  replied  with  readiness  to  questions 
from  Scripture  History,  Writing  and  Arithmetic  were  well  ex- 
emplified by  the  elder  ones,  but  those  works  of  science  with 
which  the  shelves  of  our  libraries  are  stored,  and  under  which 
they  groan,  had  not  found  their  wav  to  this  happy  retreat  th 
had  learned  what  those  books  of  science  can  never  teach- 
Enough  for  man  to  know 
That  virtue  alone  gives  liappinesH  beloM'. 

and  consequently  among  the  leai'ners  was  visible,  Avhat  does  not 
always  distinguish  our  better  endowed  and  more  highly  in- 
structed seminaries,  docility,  subordination,  and  profound  at- 
tention to  every  precept  and  illustration.  Habits  of  application 
and  a  desire  for  knowledge  were  infused  into  all ;  so  trained  up 
were  they  in  industry,  according  to  the  precept  of  St.  Paul,  Titus, 
iii.  14,  **  Let  ours  also  learn  to  maintain  good  works  for  necessary 
'*  uses  that  they  be  not  unfruitful,"  that  even  the  boys,  in  the  in- 
terval of  their  lessons,  were  busily  engaged  in  knitting  stockings 
for  winter. 

To  the  simple  admonitions  which  I  gave  to  them,  they 
listened  with  respect  and  reverence  :  and  ere  they  received  the 
parting blessing,roseand  repeated  a  fewpassages  from  the  inspired 
volume,  and  lifted  up  their  accordant  voices,  chaunting  "  Blessed 
"  be  the  Lord  God  of  Israel,  for  he  hath  visited  and  redeemed 
"  his  people." 

SECOND  VISIT  TO  THE  PATRIARCH,  OR  THE 
LODGE  IN  THE  WILDERNESS. 

With  the  light  of  the  early  morning  I  commenced  my 
journey  once  more  to  visit  my  secluded  and  inteiesting  friends. 
Autumn  had  already  infused  chillness  into  the  atmosphere,  and 
somewhat  of  tender  melancholy  pervaded  the  heart,  nature  seems 
to  regard  with  sadness  the  passing  away  of  the  glories  of  summer, 
and  to  robe  herself  as  it  were  for  humiliation.

As  the  sun  increased  in  power  and  brilliance,  more  of  cheer- 
f'lilnoss  overs])road  the  landscape.  The  jjines  were  busily  dih- 
stMuinatinf^  their  win^'ed  seeds — the  germ  of  future  forests.  Like 
ins(^rts,  with  a  floatinj^  motion,  they  fspread  around  for  miles. 
J.jir"e  droves  of  swine  made  tlieir  repast  upon  this  half  ethereal 
food.  How  mindful  is  nature's  God  of  even  his  humblest 
jieiisioners. 

Ah  1  ap})ro}iehed  the  cluster  of  cottage.*i,  which  now  assumed 
the  appearance  of  a  village,  the  eldest  son  advanced  to  meet  me. 
His  head  declined  like  one  struggling  with  a  grief  he  would  fain 
endeavour  to  subdue — taking  my  hand  in  both  of  his,  he  raised 
it  to  his  lips.  Neither  could  speak  a  word — but  it  was  clearly 
written  on  his  expressive  countenance — come  «iuickly  ere  he  die. 

We  entered  together  the  apartment  of  the  good  old  patriarch 
— one  glance  convinced  me  that  he  was  not  long  to  be  numbered 
among  us — that  his  sand  was  fast  running  out — and  that  he  was 
hastening  to  be  "gathered  to  his  fathers."  His  posterity  were 
gathered  round  his  dying  bed  in  sorrow,  bui,  their  sorrow  was 
ijot  as  those  without  hope — ho  had  taught  them  while  living,  to 
look  through  things  temi)oral  to  things  eternal — and  the  fruit 
of  his  lessons  was  visible  ir.  the  weejnng  resignation  of  all. 

He  was  pale  and  fearfully  emaciated  ;  but  as  I  spoke  of  the 
Saviour,  who  "  went  not  up  to  joy  until  he  first  suffered  pain," 
his  brow  again  lighted  up  with  the  calm  expression  of  one  who 
knew  that  his  "  May  to  eternal  joy  was  to  suffer  with  Christ" — 
who  knew  that  his  "door  to  eternal  life  was  gladly  to  die  with 
•Jesus."  Greatly  comforted  by  prayer,  he  desired  that  the  holy 
connnunion  might  be  once  more  administered  to  him  and  his 
children  before  his  departure.  There  Mas  a  separation  around 
his  bed,  those  who  had  been  accustomed  to  partake  it  with  him 
drew  near,  and  knelt  around  the  dying  man.  Fixing  his  eyes  on 
the  others,  he  said,  with  an  energy  of  tone  which  ^ve  thought  had 
forsaken  him — "  Oh  my  children  will  ye  bo  thus  divided  at  the 
last  day  !"    A  burst  of  waihng  grief  was  the  reply. 

Never,  never  will  the  awfulness  of  that  solemn  scene  be 
effaced  from  my  remembrance  ;  the  expressive  features,  speaking 
even  in  death — the  thrilling  responses  of  the  venerable  servant 
of  God,  into  whose  expiring  body,  the  soul  seemed  to  return  with 
power,  that  it  might  leave  the  last  testimony  of  faith  and  hope 
to  those  he  loved,  are  among  theunfadingimagery  of  my  existence. 
The  spirit  seemed  to  kindle  more  and  more  in  its  last  lingering 
uound  the  thresh-hold  of  time,  and  in  a  tone,  whose  clearness 
-  .0  emphasis  surprised  us,  the  departing  saint  breathed  forth  a 
'  ss  iig  on  those  who  surrounded  him, "  in  the  name  of  that  God 
V,   f  &gt;e  peace  passeth  all  understanding." 

A.iei-e  was  an  interval,  during  which  beseemed  to  slumber — 
whispers  of  hope  ("  if  he  sleep,  Lord,  he  shall  do  well")  were 
heard  around  his  couch _,  that  he  might  wake  and  be  refreshed. 
At  length  his  eyes  slowly  unclosed ;  they  were  glazed  and  deeply 
sunk  in  their  sockets.  Their  glance  was  long  and  kind  upon 
those  who  hung  over  his  pillow.  His  lips  moved,  but  now  no 
longer  audibly — bowing  my  head  more  closely,  I  found  that  he 
wa,s  speaking  of  "  Him  who  is  the  resurrection  and  the  life."    A

nliglit  shuddering;  passed  over  his  frame,  and  the  venerable  man 
wa«  at  rest  for  ever. 

The  voice  of  weeping  arose  from  among  the  children,  who 
had  not  been  summoned  to  the  bed  of  death,  and  ere  I  had  at- 
tempted, or  could  attempt  consolation,  the  lay  reader,  with  an 
unfaltering  tone  pronounced — "The  Lord  gave,  and  the  Lord 
"  liath  taken  away,  blessed  be  the  name  of  the  Lord." 

Deep  silence  ensued — it  seemed  as  if  every  heart  was  in- 
stalling him  who  spake  in  the  place  of  the  father  and  governor 
who  had  departed.  It  was  a  spontaneous  homaj'e  to  the  divine 
ordinance,  an  acknowledgment  of  the  right  of  primogeniture, 
which  no  politician  could  condemn.  He  stood  amongst  them  in 
the  simple  majesty  of  his  birthright. — Gen.  xliii.  33.  A  Reuben 
and  a  Piiest,  to  guide  his  people  m  tlie  w.ay  everlasting.  It  was 
as  if  the  mantle  of  an  arisen  prophet  had  descended  upon  him, 
as  if  those  ashen  lips  had  broken  the  seal  of  death  to  utter  "  be- 
"  hold  my  servant  whom  I  have  chosen."  Every  eye  fixed  upon 
him  its  expression  of  fealty  and  love. 

Gradually  the  inhabitants  retired  to  their  respective  habita- 
tions. Each  individual  paused  at  the  pillow  of  the  departed 
patriarch,  to  take  a  solemn  and  final  farewell ;  and  some  of  the 
cliildren  climbed  up  to  kiss  the  marble  face,  so  long  the  object  of 
their  infantine  affection.  I  was  left  alone  with  the  lay-reader 
and  the  p  '  The  enthusiasm  of  the  scene  had  i)assed  away, 
and  the  to.  of  the  son  triumphed.    Passed  years  rushed  liki? 

a  foaming  tii.  over  his  memory.  The  distant  but  undimmed 
impressions  of  fancy  and  of  childhood — the  planting  of  that  once 
wild  waste — the  changes  of  those  fleeting  years  which  hatl 
sprinkled  his  raven  locked  temples  with  grey  hairs — all,  all — 
with  their  sorrows  and  their  joys,  came  back  full  upon  his  recol- 
lections, associated  with  the  lifeless  image  of  his  beloved  sire. 
In  the  bitterness  of  bereavement  he  covered  his  face  with  his 
hands  and  wept. 

The  iron  frame  which  had  borne  the  hardening  of  half  a  cen- 
tury, shook  like  the  breast  of  an  infant  when  it  sobbed  out  its 
sorrows.  I  waited  until  the  first  shock  of  grief  had  subsided, 
then  passing  my  arm  gently  within  his,  I  repeated,  "  I  heard  a 
"  voice  from  heaven,  saying,  write  from  henceforth,  blessed  are 
"  the  dead  which  die  in  the  Lord."  Instantly  raising  himself 
upright,  he  responded  in  a  voice  whose  deep  inflections  sunk 
into  my  soul,  "  Even  so  saith  the  spirit,  for  they  rest  from  their 
**  labours,  and  their  works  do  follow  them." 

I  remained  to  attend  the  funeral  obsequies  of  the  patriarch. 
In  the  heart  of  their  territory  there  was  a  shady  dell,  sacred  to 
the  dead.  It  was  surrounded  by  a  neat  enclosure,  and  planted 
with  trees ;  the  drooping  branches  of  the  willow  swept  in  silenco 
over  the  grave  of  the  mother  of  the  colony — near  her  slumbered 
the  remains  of  her  youngest  son.  Several  other  mounds  svelled 
around  them,  most  of  which,  by  their  smaller  size,  told  of  the 
smitten  flowers  of  infancy.  To  this  goodly  company  we  bore  the 
last  remains  of  him  who  had  been  revered  as  the  father  and 
bright  exemplar  of  them  all.  With  solemn  steps,  his  descen- 
dants, two  and  two,  followed  the  ranch  loved  corpse.  I  heard  a 
convulsive  and  suppressed  breathing  among  the  more  tender  of

tlio  train  ;  but  when  the  burial  service  commenced  all  was 
husijod  aiul  still  as  ni-lit.  And  never  have  1  more  fully  realized 
its  surprihiiiir  pathos  and  jjower,  tlian  when  from  the  centre  of 
tliat  deep  soTitiide,  on  tlie  brink  of  that  waitinjj  ^rave,  it  poured 
forth  its  heavenly  consolations. 

"  I  am  the  Resurrection  and  the  Life.  Whosoever  believeth 
"  in  nn;  shall  not  perish,  but  hath  everlasting;  Life, 

Man  that  is  born  of  a  wonuin  liath  but  a  short  time  to  live, 
and  is  full  of  misery.  He  conu  h  up  and  is  cut  down  like  a 
flower,  lie  Heeth  as  it  were  a  shadow,  and  never  continueth  in 
one  stay.  In  tlie  midst  of  life  we  are  in  death  ;  of  whom  may 
we  seek  for  succour,  but  of  thee,  O  Lord  !  who  for  our  sins  art 
justly  displeased  at  uai  Yet,  O  Lord  God  most  holy,  O  God 
most  mi^Mity,  O  holy  and  most  merciful  God  and  Saviour,  deliver 
us  not  into  the  bitter  pains  of  eternal  death.  Thou  knowest 
Lord,  the  secrets  of  our  hearts,  shut  not  thy  merciful  ears  to  our 
prayers,  but  spare  us,  O  Lord  most  merciful — O  God  most  holy 
-  O  God  most  mighty — O  holy  and  most  merciful  ISaviour,  suffer 
us  not  at  our  last  hour,  for  any  })ains  of  deatii,  to  fall  from  thee. 

Circumstances  compelled  me  to  leave  this  mourning  com- 
nuinity  innnediately  after  committing  the  dust  of  their  pious 
ancestor  to  the  earth.  They  accompanied  me  some  distance  on 
my  journey,  and  our  farting  was  with  mutual  tears.  Turning 
to' get  one  more  glimpse  of  them,  as  the'.r  forms  faded  in  the 
distance,  1  heard  the  faint  echo  of  a  clear  voice  ;  it  was  the  lay- 
reader  speaking  of  the  hope  of  the  resurrection — "  If  we  believe 
"  in  Jesus." 

Full  of  thought,  I  pursued  my  homeward  way.  Is  devotion 
never  encumbered  or  impeded  by  the  splendour  that  surrounds 
her  ?  Amid  the  long  aisles  of  tiie  lofty  Cathedral — the  throng 
of  rich  stooled  worshippers — the  melody  of  the  solemn-toned 
organ — does  that  incense  never  spend  itself  upon  earth,  which 
should  rise  to  the  throne  of  heaven  i  On  the  very  beauty  and 
outward  glory  of  its  ordinances,  may  not  the  spirit  proxully  rest 
(alas,  too  often,  as  these,  and  other  deserted  solitudes  proclaim) 
and  go  no  more  forth  to  the  work  of  benevolence,  in  seeking  out 
Christ's  scattered  fold  ?  or  spread  its  wings  at  the  call  of  faith, 
to  carry  the  blessed  truths  of  redeeming  love,  to  the  utmost 
bounds  of  the  universe. 

Yet  surely,  neglected  though  it  be,  there  is  a  reality  in  reli- 
gion, though  man  too  often  cheats  himself  with  the  shadow. 

Here  have  I  beheld  religion  in  true  simplicity,  disrobed  of 
all  pomp  and  circumstance,  yet  with  a  power  to  soothe  the  pas- 
sions into  harmony,  to  maintain  the  virtue,  in  daily  and  vigorous 
exercise,  and  to  give  victory  to  the  soul,  when  death  vanquishe.&lt;3 
the  body.  I  took  the  lesson  to  my  heart,  and  when  religious 
feeling  has  languished  or  grown  cold  within  me,  I  have  again 
rekindled  the  tiame  by  the  remembrance  of  "  these  few  sheep  in 
"  the  wilderness."     1  Sam,  xvii.  28.

INTRODUCTORY 


ACCOUNT  OF 
SOCIETY. 


THE  TORONTO 


Previous  to  the  insertion  of  the  letters  and  journals  which 
shew  the  progress  of  the  henevolent  exertions  of  the  late  Bishop 
of  Quebec,  in  conjunction  with  the  Society  established  at 
Toronto,  in  1830,  **  for  Convertimj  and  Cmlizimf  tha  Indians^  and 
"  Propnijatincf  the  (ion/tel  amoiuj  the  d^nitute  Settlers  in  Ujiper  Canadn,*^ 
it  may  be  incumbent  upon  me  to  give  some  general  information 
of  the  origin  of  that  society,  and  the  more  so,  as  since  the 
lamented  death  of  the  venerable  JJishoj)  of  Quebec,  (in  pur- 
suance of  directions  received  from  him  on  his  recovery  from  his 
first  attack,)  I  have  determined  in  future  to  carry  on,  through  its 
instrumentality,  the  work  in  which  1  have  been,  since  1834,  en- 
gaged as  the  solitary  agent  of  the  Bishop  of  Quebec,  and  trustee 
for  the  subsidies  raised  bv  me  among  his  friends.  The  arrange- 
ment of  this  matter,  made  by  the  IJishop  of  Montreal,  will  be 
found  in  the  Appendix  to  this  volume. 

With  respect  to  the  society,  its  views,  and  its  claims  upon 
the  Christian  feelings  of  the  British  community,  I  cannot  do 
better  than  reprint  the  introductory  account  given  in  its  first 
year's  report,  dated  October,  1831,  premising  only  that  it  pos- 
sesses all  those  advantages  for  prompt  and  useful  management ^  which 
hKol  knoidedae  of  local  clrcumMances,  in  such  a  case  particularly 
afford,  and  in  which  view  it  seemed  peculiarly  pointed  out  as 
the  channel,  (in  connection  with  the  succeeding  Bishop)  for  the 
Upper  Canada  Travelling  Mission  Fund  hereafter  to  work  with. 

Whenever  a  body  oi  Christians  is  called  into  existence,  it  is 
imperative  upon  them  to  labour  for  the  increase  of  their  numbers 
by  the  local  dissemination  of  the  divine  truths  of  which  they  are 
in  possession.  If  it  be  not  unreasonable  to  suppose  that  their 
distribution  into  several  parts  of  the  woild  is  over-ruled  by  a 
wise  Providence,  for  this  especial  purpose,  they  are  called  upon 
to  consider  whether  by  selfish  reserving,  or  inactively  commu- 
nicating religious  knowledge,  they  do  not,  in  fact,  frustrate  the 
grace  of  God.  Accordingly,  such  a  consideration  has  seldom 
failed  to  operate  powerfully  upon  all  Christian  communities, 
wherever  established,  in  times  ancient  and  modem.  The  sacred 
use  to  which  Great  Britain,  at  this  day,  puts  the  enlargement  of 
her  empire  in  remote  counties,  is  to  impart  to  them  the  religious 
faith  to  which  she  owes  her  own  superiority  ; — and  it  is  before 
her  influence,  thus  exercised,  more  than  of  any  other  nation, 
that  superstition  and  ignorance  are  fast  disappearing  from  the 
globe.  While  her  other  dependencies  exhibit  more  striking  in- 
stances of  this  fact,  the  land  in  which  we  live  sufficiently  attests 
it ;  where,  it  must  be  acknowledged  to  the  honour  of  Christians 
of  all  denominations,  much  has  been  done,  both  among  them- 
selves, for  their  better  edification,  and  among  the  benighted 
Heathens  whom  they  found  in  occupation  of  the  soil. 

The  Church  of  England  Clergy,  occupying  long  established 
stations,  have  not  always  had  that  command  over  the  Indiav' 
population,  who  are  migratory  in  their  habits,  and  ever  shifting 
from  one  hunting  ground  to  another,  which  is  necessary  to  make

jiny  groat  progress  in  tho  work  of  tlieir  conversion.    Moreover 
the  hir&lt;;(!  iuhiitions  of  their  own  couiitryincii,  contiiumlly  mudo 
to  their  clmi'j^^e,  iritltoiit  an  if  additional   adequate  jtroriniou,    have 
latterly  eaUed  for  tlieir  exclusive  attention.     Alive,  however,  to 
the  inijjortance  and  oblifj;ation  of  keepiiifif  the  conversion  of  the 
natives  in  view,  the  Clergy  and  Laity  of  tiie  Church  of  England 
in  tiiis  province  began  to  think  of  other  means  of  effecting  an 
object  so  desirable  ;  and  accordingly  projected  a  society,  under 
which  Christian  teachers  should  be  expressly  provided  for  the 
Indian  populativ)n,  wherever  it  should  present  itself  in  sufHcient 
numbers  :  might  be  commended  for  any  considerable  length  of 
time,  or  held  out  a  hojjc  of  becoming  permanently  settled.    This 
excellent  design  was  brought  under  public  consideration  at  a 
meeting  called  at  York,  October  2Uth,  1830,  which  issued  in  tho 
formation  of  tlie  ])roposed   society,  under   the  name  of  *' The 
"  Society  for  Converting  and  Civilizing  the  Indians  in  Upper 
"  Canada."     PerJiaps  a  short   summary  of  the  address  of  the 
Lord  Bishop  of  Quebec,  who  was  called  to  preside  on  that  occa- 
sion, will  convey  the  best  information  as  to  the  views  of  the  in- 
stitution, which  his  Lordship  so  ably  assisted  to  call  into  exis- 
tence,   llaving  explained  that  the  intention  of  the  meeting  was 
to  form  a  society  whose  object  should  be  to  bring  the  Indians  of 
this  country  to  the  knowledge  of  true  religion,  and  the  comforts 
of  civilized  life,  his  Lordship  proceeded  to  state,  with  regard  to 
the  services  to  be  rendered  by  the  society,  that  they  might  be 
directed  to  various  points,  and  such  as  the  labours  of  other 
denominations  had  never  reached.    As  a  primary  measure  he 
would  suggest  the  expediency  of  keeping  up  the  communication 
opened  with  the  Indians  on  the  north  shore  of  the  Lake  Huron 
by  the  Rev.  G.  Archbold,  P.  G.  F.  P.,  who,  with  true  missionary 
zeal,  had  himself  resided  among  them  the  greater  part  of  the 
sunnner,  and  at  last  upon  his  own  departure,  left  them  to  the 
care  of  a  gentleman  (Mr.  Cameron,)  who  voluntarily  undertook 
to  continue  their  instruction.     (To  this  mission  Mr.  M'M.  was 
afterwards  appointed.     See  his  letters.)    There  existed  also  a 
body  of  Indians  on  tho  shores  of  Lake  St.  Clair,  (The  Monsecs 
and  iJear  Creek.     See  ]Mr.  Flood's  letters,)  to  whom  no  mission- 
ary liad  hitheito  found  his  way,  and  the  society  might  be  the 
first  to  convey  to  them  the  glail  tidings  of  salvation.     Though 
much  had  been  done  for  the  six  nations  on  the  grand  river  by  the 
New  J'jngland  Company,  there  werestill  powerful  calls  for  further 
assistance  in  that  quarter.     The  Mohawks,  in  the  IJay  of  Quinte, 
he  had  no  doubt,  would  attract  the  interest  of  the  society,  as 
would  also,  he  thought,  notwithstanding  their  distance,  a  tribe 
of  natives  already  settled  in  villages  at  the  mouth  of  the  River 
Columbia,  and  rei)resented  by  Governor  Simpson,  of  the  Hud- 
son's Bay  Company,  to  be  a  mild  and  docile  peoj)le,  ripe  for 
religious  and  general  improvement.     The  funds  of  the  society 
might  also,  he  conceived,  be  i)rofitably  employed  in  printing 
tracts  in  the  various  languages  of  the  native  tribes,  in  the  esta- 
blishment of  schools  among  them,  and  the  education  of  some  of 
their  youth  for  the  office  of  catechists,  or  even  for  holy  orders. 

Another  meeting  was  appointed  for  the  22nd  of  November. 
In  the  meantime  there  were  several  subscribers  to   whom  it

occurred,  th  it  British  settlers,  wlio  are  to  be  found  in  many 
parts  of  the  country  in  a  state  of  entire  religious  destitution, 
called  as  loudly  for  the  interference  of  the  society  as  the  uncon- 
verted Indians,  and  that  it  was  no  less  an  object  of  Christian 
solicitude  to  prevent  the  extinction,  than  to  lif^^hten  uj)  the  flame 
of  Christian  knowled&lt;(e.  The  statement  of  their  opinion  at  the 
subsequent  meetinff  produced  so  stronjj  an  impression,  that  it 
was  resolved,  in  order  to  include  those  objects,  to  extend  the 
designation  of  the  society,  and  it  was  fiiuiUy  aj^reed  that  it 
should  stand  as  it  now  ap[)eared  in  the  title  page  of  their  reports, 
and  it  is  to  be  devoutly  hoped,  that  the  association  whose  designs 
it  indicates,  and  wliose  labours  it  defines,  will  become  conspicuous 
not  only  for  its  conii)rehensive  nominal  aim,  but  also  for  its 
actual  accomplishment  of  a  correspondent  extent  of  good. 

The  establishment  of  such  an  institution  must  be  considered 
in  every  way  a  happy  circumstance,  but  particularly  as  it  pre- 
sents a  rallying  point  for  the  Intrinsic  energies  of  the  Church  of 
England  in  this  country.  Nor  can  there  be  a  doubt  that  all 
conscientious  members  of  her  communion  will  readily  avail 
themselves  of  the  opportunity  now  oft'ered,  of  fixing  upon  a 
broad  and  durable  basis,  a  society  which  shall  provide  in  perpe- 
tuity, for  the  maintenance  and  aisseminatiou  of  her  pure  faith 
and  worship  throughout  the  colony. 

Upon  these  indeed,  as  the  society  rests  the  most  natur.il 
c!aim,  so  does  she  fix  her  highest  expectations  ;  while  in  unison 
with  the  wishes  of  its  Right  Reverend  originator,  it  does  not 
exclude  the  hope  that,  as  its  efforts  will  be  directed  to  spots 
where  there  is  an  entire  destitution  of  Christianity  in  any  shape,  it 
will  not  want  the  good  wishes  and  assistance  of  Christians  of  all 
denominations. 

The  first  year  of  the  society's  efibrts  were  confined,  by  the 
small  extent  of  their  funds,  (barely  £102,)  to  the  employment,  as 
suggested  by  the  Bishop,  of  Mr.  J,  Cameron,  at  Lake  Huron,  La 
Cloche,  and  Sault  St.  Marie — to  sending  the  Rev.  J.  O'Briar. 
for  the  purpose  of  ascei  taining  the  prospects  of  a  mission  o\\ 
Lake  St.  Clair,  and  to  the  support  of  an  interpreter  to  the 
Mohawk  mission,  in  the  Bay  of  Quinte. 

The  letters  of  Mr.  Cameron  and  Mr.  O'Brien  to  Capt.  Phil- 
potts,  R.E.,  the  secretary  of  the  society,  are  the  first  in  the 
following  series,  which  terminates  with  the  fifth  report  of  1835. 

Then  follow  the  letters  more  immediately  connected  with 
the  Upper  Canadian  Travelling  Mission  Fund  of  the  late  vene- 
rable Bishop.  It  is  much  to  be  regretted  that  the  journals  of 
Mr.  Green,  which  were  promised  to  be  here  in  September,  have 
not  arrived  in  time,  but  as  his  letters  give  a  tolerably  good  in- 
sight into  the  state  of  destitution  in  which  the  emigrants  have 
been  found  ;  and  prove  the  justice  of  the  Bishop's  repeated  calls 
for  aid,  I  have  thought  it  better  not  to  delay  the  publication, 
and  I  commit  it  to  the  world  in  the  hope  that,  by  Divine  Grace, 
it  may  prove  advantageous  to  all  who  labour  for  the  spiritual 
interests  of  our  Canadian  brethren,  and  may  not  entail  any  very 
material  loss  upon  the  fund  under  my  own  peculiar  charge.

LETTER  FROM  MR.  .1.  D.  CAMERON,  MISSIONARY. 

Snvlt  St.  Marie,  Sept.  2iHh,  10:il. 

Dear  Sin, —  Inrrivod  lioroon  the  15th  inst.,  woworosixtocn 
(lavs  on  our  way,  boiiijj  very  unfortunate  with  respect  to  weather, 
tontniry  winds  and  rain.  Our  voyajro  was  one  continued  scene 
of  danfjers  and  perils.  Whenever  1  look  back,  it  is  always  with 
emotions  of  gratitude  and  thanks  to  our  Heavenly  Father,  whose 
"  Hand  is  not  straitened  that  it  cannot  save"  all  such  as  humbly 
trust  in  him.  The  Indians  of  Lake  Huron  are  all  desirous  to 
liave  a  niiTiister  and  a  school  master  on  the  Manitoulin  Islands. 
I  have  to  intimate  to  you  that  four  or  five  Chiefs  of  the 
Ottawas  liave  consented  to  be  instructed  in  our  creed.  The^  also 
wish  to  settle  on  their  island.  An  establishment  on  that  island 
will  be  attended  with  enormous  expence  and  trouble.  I  cannot 
recommend  that  particular  spot  for  a  villajje,  but  for  a  school  I 
can  recommend  "  Petit  Courant"  on  the  Manitoulin.  Some  of 
the  Indians  have  cleaved  a  piece  of  pnnmd,  wherein  they  sow 
some  corn  and  potatoes.  It  is  the  only  place  where  the  Indians 
generally  reside  in  summer  and  autumn.  In  Mississahjj^ue, 
Indians  collect  in  preat  numbers  in  the  sprinpf  to  spear  sturjjfcon, 
whicli  abound  there.  Of  the  two  places,  I  think  the  former  is 
preferable.  In  my  humble  opinion,  a  school  house  and  teacher 
ouffht  to  be  established  at  this  place.  There  is  a  very  jjreat 
number  of  children  whose  parents  are  all  desirous  of  having 
them  properly  instructed.  Should  a  school  be  placed  here,  and 
another  on  tlie  Manitoulin  Island,  I  can  always  visit  the  schools 
alternately. 

It  is  with  unfeigned  pleasure  I  now  apprize  you,  that  the 
number  of  our  Christian  society  is  increasing  day  after  day. 
The  Indians  are  all  very  willing*  to  embrace  our  reliji^ion,  and 
may  lie  dispose  their  hearts  and  minds  to  receive  the  offers  of 
salvation  by  faith  in  the  beloved  Son  of  God. 

I  remain,  &amp;c.  J.  D.  CAMERON. 

To  Capt.  Philpotts,  R.E.,  Secretary,  &amp;c.  Toronto. 

P.S. — The  school  commenced  on  the  18th  instant,  and  I  am 
happy  to  inform  you  has  ever  since  continued  to  increase.  There 
are  at  present  eighteen  scholars.  There  is  every  prospect  of  an 
augmentation  in  the  winter.  The  children  are  apparently  all 
attached  to  their  teacher,  my  cousin,  who  is,  on  his  part,  very 
kind  and  attentive  to  them. 


FROM  MR.  CAMERON  TO  CAPT.  PHILPOTTS,  R.E. 

SauU  St.  Marie,  3rd  January,  1 832. 
Dear  Sir, — I  take  the  earliest  opportunity  of  informing 
you,  that  the  conversion  of  the  Indians  to  the  Christian  faith  is 
making  rapid  progress.  They  are  coming  in  under  the  pale  of 
salvation  day  after  day,  through  the  tender  mercy  of  our  God. 
The  correct  number  of  the  converts  is  not  yet  ascertained,  but  I 
think  about  fifty-two  souls.  Our  meetings  are  generally  very 
numerously  attended.  Our  place  of  worship  will  soon  be,  glory 
to  God,  too  small.  We  require  another  house  of  larger  dimen- 
sions, but  it  cannot  be  obtained  in  this  place.  We  must  build 
one  if  we  want  one — and  want  assistance,  for  we  have  no  means

EXTUi^CT 

From  a  Report  by  the  Ilev.  J.  O'lir'uiu  n-ldtire  to  the  At'mlun  on  Lakr 

St.  Clair,  urn. 

"It  appears  the  Indians  have  no  objection,  in  the  event  of  a 
settlement  on  St.  Clair,  to  send  their  children  to  school  to  rec(»ive 
instructions  of  a  moral  nature:  they  setMued  jronerally  pleased 
with  theidea  rather  than  otherwise  ;  but  Avith  reference  to  them- 
selves, they  would  not  submit  to  any  discipline  of  the  kind,  if 
required.     This  disinclination  to  restraint  is  a  necessary  conse- 
quence of  their  manner  of  livinjif  from  their  youth  up,  bein&lt;i;  t'roo 
and  unrestrained.     The  adults  amon^  then;  are  at  present  hostile 
to  any  attempts  to  introduce  Christianity  amonj;  tliem  :  and  if 
any  decided  measures  were  taken  for  the  accom])lishnient  of  so 
desira'  'o  an  object  at  the  present  moment,  or  in  connexion  at  the 
same  time  with  the  establishment  of  the  colony  on  St.  Clair,  it 
would,  humanly  speakin*?,  be  productive  of  conse(iuences  un- 
favourable to  the  benij^n  instructions  of  his  excellency  Sir  John 
Colborne.    This  aversion  of  the  Indians  to  the  subject  of  Chris- 
tianity, and  the  opposition  they  would  ji^ive  to  it,  chiefly  arises, 
in  my  opinion,  from  the  insinuations  and  exertions  of  artful  and 
desi^nin^  men,  whose  interest  it  is  to  thwart  every  effort  tending,' 
to  improve  the  condition  of  the  Indians,  for  if  they  were  civilized, 
those  enemiesto  the  cause  of  truth  and  Immanity  could  no  loniifor 
carry  on  their  system  of  hetirtless  peculation.    (See  tlie  {i;radual 
effect  of  Mr.  Flood's  efforts  .amonp;  these  tribes  in  liis  letters— 
and  the  sort  of  hnff-hmnanized  society  by  which  they  are  sur- 
rounded displayed  in  his  journal — Ed.) 

"  However,  the  utmost  exertions  should  be  used  to  collec  t 
them  together,  and  jfive  instructions  to  their  youth,  as  it  is  a 
measure  which  the  elders  among  them  approve;  and  perhaps 
twelve  months  may  not  elapse  Avhen  a  very  favourable  door  inay 
open  for  missionary  labours,  though  the  prospects  at  present  are 
gloomy.  We  may  reasonably  expect  that  much  of  their  pre- 
judices would  be  overcome  by  that  time.  The  insinuations  now 
artfully  thrown  otit,  and  the  reports  diligently  disseminated  to 
poison  their  minds  proving  falsej  together  with  the  benefits  of 
civilized  life  being  partially  experienced,  its  comforts  felt,  and 
their  condition  bettered,  they  would  be  sensible  of  the  improve- 
ment, and  therefore  would  no  longer  oflfer  the  opposition  they

HOME  DISTRICT  TRAVELLINCr  MISSION, 
UPPER  CANADA. 


Corresj^ondence  of   the  Iter.  Adam  Elliot,  in  the  licr.  C.  Mathnn, 
Secretary  to  the  Society  for  Converthuj  and  CiTilhiiuj  the  Indians,  ^r. 

Net(nmirkef,2i\th  January,  11133. 

Reverend  Sir, — I  have  the  honour  to  send  you,  for  the 
information  of  the  Society,  a  concise  statement  of  my  proceed- 
ings since  I  commenced  my  missionary  labours. 

On  Sunday  the  18th  November,  I  read  prayers  and  preached 
in  a  school  near  the  line  between  the  townships  of  York  and 
Scarborough.  Upwards  of  fifty  people  attended,  and  five 
children  were  baptized.  Some  of  the  people  in  that  neighbour- 
hood expressed  a  desire  to  have  a  Church  erected  ;  and  one  of 
the  inhabitants  offers  to  give  ten  acres  of  land  for  the  site.  Having 
arrived  in  the  township  of  Pickering  from  York,  I  rea(l 
prayers,  lectured,  and  baptized  two  children,  at  the  house  of  Mr. 
I'rancis  Leys.  About  thirty  people  attended.  On  the  following 
Sunday  I  preached  to  a  numerous  and  respectable  assemblage  of 
people,  in  a  Meeting  House  which  is  occupied  by  different  de- 
nominations, in  the  township  of  Whitby.  Three  children  were 
baptized.  Several  of  the  inhabitants  of  Whitby  expressed  their 
solicitude  for  the  regular  ministrations  of  the  Church. 

Having  continued  my  journey  to  Darlington,  I  performed 
divine  service  on  Advent  Sunday  at  the  village,  and  preached 
to  a  numerous  and  attentive  congregation.  In  the  evening  the 
congregation  was  still  more  numerous,  and  the  singing  was  ex- 
cellent. Sufficient  has  been  subscribed  to  pay  the  expense  of 
erecting  a  church  in  Darlington,  but  little  has  yet  been  done, 
on  account  of  some  disagreement  respecting  the  site,  among  the

poisouM  coinpofiinji  tho  committee  anpointod  1)V  tho  iiiiiulMtant&lt;i. 
It  In  expected,  liowever,  that  the  ori^rmul  deNi^n  of  the  suhN&lt;Til)(&gt;rN 
will  h(M'ui'i'ie«l  into  execution  next  Nutntner.  While  in  Darlin^'- 
ton,  I  n'ceive«l  much  attention  and  kindnesM  from  Mr.  Warren, 
and  others  of  the  inhahitants,  and  was  treated  with  the  greatest 
lioHpitality  and  civility  by  Mr.  LiHter  and  his  family,  at  wIionc 
Ikmihc  1  rcHided. 

On  my  return  to  Whithy,  T  found  that  Mr.  Warren  had 
luHMi  ^ood  enouf^h  to  nuiU(&gt;  an  appointment  for  me  to  preach  at 
tlie  meetin^r  house.  'J'houpfh  our  meeting  was  ut  ni^'ht,  and  tho 
weather  rather  unfavourable,  the  confi;re^ation  was  lar;;e.  'I'ho 
Kpiscopalians  in  that  township  have  thu  erection  of  a  church  in 
&lt;;ontemplation. 

As  I  procoodod  from  Whitby  to  Roach,  tho  weather  was 
mild,  but  on  account  of  the  badness  of  the  r&lt;k.id,  travellinj;  was 
very  disa/^reoablo  :  thu  woods  having  lost  their  lovely  folia^'O  of 
jfroon,  presented  a  dreary  aspect.  There  was  scarcely  any  snow 
in  the  southern  part  of  Whitby  ;  but  a  considerable  ipumtity  as 
I  advanced  towards  Iteach  ; — there  1  crossed  the  mountain, 
which  in  those  parts  is  usually  called  the  r'uhjes.  It  is  of  con- 
siderable height,  and  covered  with  lofty  pines  :  and  its  north 
side  connnands  a  view  of  a  snuill  lake.  The  settlers  in  lleiich 
are  yet  comparatively  few,  and  a  small  proportion  of  them  are 
members  of  the  Church.  I  road  prayers  and  preached  in  that 
neighbourhood  thveo  times,  i,o  very  attentive  con;j:re^atioi's. 
There  I  received  much  attention  and  kindness  from  Air.  llurd, 
who  is  a  pious  person,  and  t'.  member  of  the  Methodist  Society. 

Having  returned  to  tho  rear  of  tho  township  of  W^hitby,  I 
road  j)rayers  and  lectured  on  tho  11th  December  to  alar""  and 
attentive  assembUijjfO  of  peojde,  many  of  whom  are  said  tc  ony 
to  a  sect  who  some  time  afro  separated  from   the  W  an 

Methodists  in  England.    On  tho  following  morning  I  baptize&lt;l 
four  children  belonging  to  members  of  the  church. 

On  the  12th  of  December,  Irode  between  Whitby  and  Brock, 
a  distance  of  twenty-five  miles.  Two  days  afterwards  I  read 
prayers  and  lectured  near  the  line  between  tho  townships  of 
Brock  and  Mariposa.  On  that  occasion  I  baptized  three  children, 
K.id  explained  some  things  respecting  baptism  which  are  ill  un- 
derstood by  many.  On  Sunday  the  Kith  of  December,  1  per- 
formed divine  service  and  preached  in  the  school  on  the  fifth 
concession  of  Brock,  to  a  numerous  congregation,  consisting 
principally  of  Episcopalians  ;  I  also  explained  to  them  a  i)art  of 
the  liturgy,  and  baptized  six  children.  In  the  evening  I  again 
read  prayers,  and  lectured  on  a  part  of  our  blessed  Sa&gt;  iour's 
sermon  on  the  moinit.  On  that  occasion  some  of  the  members 
of  the  church  expressed  their  desire  to  have  the  sacrament  of  the 
Lord's  supperadministered  when  I  shall  next  visit  the  township. 
On  tho  following  Tuesday  I  preaclied  to  a  numerous  con- 
gregation and  baptized  thirteen  children  on  the  second  coucoh- 
sion  of  Brock.  There  I  met  with  a  very  friendly  reception  froui 
tho  inhabitants.  Mr.  Letts,  from  Ireland,  a  venerable  old  man, 
acted  as  clerk,  and  seemed  highly  pleased  in  having  an  oppor- 
tunity of  performing  a  duty  to  which  he  had  been  accustomed 
in  his  native  country.     It  is  confidently  asserted  in  Brock  that

and  Mr.  i-'arnswortli,  who  also  resides  in  Thorah,  was  kind 
enoiij:i;ii  to  accompany  me  to  a  considerahle  distance  on  the  ice 
as  I  proceeded  to  Georj^ina.  llavinjjf  arrived  in  the  townshij)of 
(jfeor^fina,  I  performed  divine  service  and  preached  at  the  house 
of  liieutenant  Johnson,  on  Hunday  'Mhh  December,  and  baptized 
seven  children  ;  tho  conji;re&lt;,'ation  was  numenms  and  attentive. 
The  inhabitants  of  that  township  are  of  difterent  persmisi&lt;m8  ; 
hut  perhai)s  the  Episcopalians  are  the  most  numerous.  There 
are  also  several  Presbyterians  in  that  nei;^iil)ourhood,from  some 
of  wlioni  1  received  much  kindness,  'i'he  nuiid)er  of  Koman 
Catholics  is  said  to  bo  considerable,  and  their  I'ricsts  visit  them 
occasionally. 

(Jn  the  Tuesday  following,'  I  read  prayers  and  preached  in 
the  same  township  at  tho  house  of  John  Mills  .Jackson,  Esquire; 
tho  conu'i*e&lt;i;ation  was  not  larfi;e,  but  respectable  and  attentive  ; 
three  children  wore  baptized. 

Having  reached  the  township  of  North  Gwillimbury,  I  r*iad 
j)rayers  and  preached  there  on  Sunday  the  (Jth  January,  to  about 
forty  very  attentive [)eople.  The  conf&gt;re}j;ation,  I  was  informed, 
would  have  been  much  larjjer  if  the  weather  had  not  been  so 
unfavourable.  Mr.  Snuilly,  at  whose  house  1  resided  while  in 
that  townsliip,  treated  me  with  great  hospitality  and  kindness. 
On  Sunday  the  13th  January,  I  performed  divine  service  and 
preached  at  two  different  places  ;  the  hearers  were  numerous 
and  attentive,  but  it  is  supposed  that  comparatively  few  of  them 
are  Ki)iscopalian8.  There  appears  to  be  m\ich  diversity  of 
opinion  in  that  township  on  the  subject  of  relipon.  There  is  a 
v(&gt;ry  new  sect  in  that  neighbourhood,  called  the  "  Children  of 
I'eace  ;" — I  had  some  conversation  with  Afr.  David  AVilson,  their 
leader,  who  behaved  to  me  with  great  civility,  and  shewed  me 
his  places  of  worship.  One  of  them  is  a  commodious  building  in 
which  the  people  assemble  for  the  purj)oses  of  i)reaching  and 
singing  hymns.  In  this  place  is  an  organ,  and  other  musical 
instruments  are  also  used.  Common  prayer  fonns  no  part  of  their 
public  worship.    Besides  this  meeting  house,  they  have  erected

another  of  considerable  mapfnitude,  which  is  built  of  wood, 
painted  white  and  {'reen,  and  ornamented  with  turrets  and 
spires.  Mr.  Wilson  '»  lormed  me  that  this  edifice  was  seven 
years  in  building,  but  that  the  expense  of  erecting  it  is  unknown. 
He  said  lie  could  neither  tell  me  the  number  of  the  Childreu  of 
Peace,  nor  state  their  partin..i;»r  tenets.  lie  never  preaches  in 
this  large  bui'ding  ;  but  Uie  people  meet  iii  it  once  a  month  to 
join  in  a  sort  of  concert  of  music,  and  present  their  offei  ings  of 
money. 

On  Sunday  the  20th  January,  I  performed  divine  service, 
and  preached  twice  at  the  village  of  Newmarket.  The  weatlier 
was  rather  unfavourable,  but  both  services  were  well  attended. 
There  ia  little  union  among  the  inhabitants  of  these  parts  in  re- 
gard to  r'lligion.  The  members  of  our  Church,  t  am  informed, 
reside  principally  in  the  village,  and  they  have  long  had  the 
erection  of  a  Ciiurch  in  contemplation. 

Permit  me  to  request  that  you  will  accept  my  sincere  thani 
for  your  kindness  and  attention  to  me,  and  to  assure  you  that  it 
is  with  much  esteem  and  respect, 

I  am,  Reverend  Sir,

TO  THE  REV.  CliARLES  MATHEWS, 

,,  SECRET AaV  TO  THE  SOCIETY,  &amp;C. 

Tecumseth,  March  2lst,  1833. 

Reverend  Sir, — I  have  the  honour  to  transmit  to  you,  for 
the  mformatior.  of  the  society,  a  brief  account  of  my  proceedings 
since  I  had  the  pleasure  of  seeing  you  in  February  last. 

On  my  way  from  York  to  Penetanguishine  I  performed 
divine  service  at  Newn:arket,  and  had  a  fine  congregation. 
Being  informed  by  the  Rev.  Mr.  Brough,  that  some  met,  ibers  of 
the  Church,  residing  in  King,  were  very  desirous  of  a  visit  fioxn  u 
Clergyman,  I  proceeded  to  that  township.  There  I  read  prayers, 
lectured,  explained  some  parts  of  the  Liturgy,  and  baptized  four 
children.  The  congregation  was  numerous,  coVisisting  chiefly  of 
members  of  the  church. 

Having  reached  the  township  of  Tecum  seth  on  Sunday  the 
10th  of  February,  we  had  divine  service  in  %  baruj  the  scliool- 
house  not  being  sufficiently  large  for  the  congregatic  a.  It  is 
supposed  that  between  two  and  three  hundred  people  were  pre- 
sent. On  the  following  day,  being  requested  by  the  people,  I 
attended  a  meeting  of  the  inhabitants  of  Tecumseth  for  consi- 
dering th  ?  expediency  of  building  a  Church.  The  meeting  was 
not  large,  but  it  was  unanimously  determined  that  a  Church 
should  be  erected,  and  the  sura  of  fifty  pounds  was  immediately 
subscribed. 

The  site  of  the  proposed  Church  is  or  a  very  excellent  lot 
of  land,  nearly  in  the  centre  of  the  township,  which  was  granted 
by  the  Government  for  a  Chuich  and  glebe. 

The  14th  of  February  being  appointed  as  a  day  of  thanks- 
giving, I  preached  near  the  town  line,  between  Tecumseth  and 
West  Gwillimbury,  to  a  numerous  and  attentive  congregation  ; 
three  children  were  baptized.    On  the  day  following  I  preached 


J^3 


to  a])ovo  forty  people  on  tlie  fifth  concession  of  Tecmnseth.  A 
{Siiiuluy  Hcliool  vas  established  in  this  to\vnshii»  hist  summer, 
which  was  well  attended ;  it  is  about  to  be  recommenced,  and  I 
have  promised  to  furnish  the  children  withciitechisms  and  other 

!)ooks. 

On  Sunday  the  lf)th  of  February,  ve  had  divine  service  iu 
Mr  Htoddart's  barn,  in  the  township  of  West  (Jwillimbury  ;  it 
is  thought  that  above  two  hundred  members  of  the  Church  were 
pres(Mit.  1  also  lectured  in  the  afternoon  near  the  Penetan- 
•■•uishine  road  ;  the  con^n-ei^ation  assembled  in  a  school  house, 
and  consisted  of  a  hundred  people.  A  subscrii)tion  has  lately 
boen  opened  in  this  township  for  the  erection  of  a  Church  in  a 
central  situation,  and  siiould  the  iniialntants  continue  nnabatin^ 
in  their  exertions,  a  Church  will  soon  be  built  equal  to.  that  in 
contemplation  in  lecumseth.  I  am  informed  that  the  Episco- 
j)alians  are  the  most  numerous  denomination  of  Christians  in 
West  Gwillimbury. 

Havinj^  reached  the-  town  of  Innisfil,  I  preached  at  the  hoiise 
of  Mr.  M'Conkey,  near  th.e  Penetariguishine  road  ;  the  frost  was 
severe,,  and  the  weathe--  stormy  ;  Itut  Ihouj^h  the  settlers  are 
compa'*atively  few  in  that  part  of  the  township,  about  t'*'  -ty 
people  assembled. 

On  the  first  Sunday  in  Lent  we  had  divine  service  at  the 
liou.soofMr.  Mann,  at  Kempenfelt  V&gt;uy  ;  the  weather  was  in- 
tensely cold,  but  the  conj^reo^ation  was  lar;i^e  and  attentive. 
(Japtain  Oliver,  who  resides  in  the  township  of  Oro,  about  a 
quarter  of  a  mile  from  the  town  plot  of  Kempenfelt,  treated  me 
with  the  f^reatest  civility  and  kindness.  Captain  O'Ltrien,  (who 
is  at  present  in  En&lt;(land)  and  ether  friends  of  theChurch,  have  been 
endeavouring-,  with  considerable  success^  to  obtain  subscriptions 
for  the  erection  of  a  Church  tu  Kempenfelt  Hay.  It  is  expected 
that  a  town  will  be  l)uilt  there  at  no  distant  period.  It  is  a 
delif^htful  j)lace  even  at  this  desolate  and  .a-eary  season  ;  the 
sites  for  building  along  the  banks  of  tlie  Bay  are  adunrable,  and 
the  views  are  extensive  and  ])leasing. 

In  the  evening  of  the  same  day  I  read  prayers  and  lectured 
at  Mr  White's,  about  seven  miles  from  Kemj)enfelt  Bay  :  my 
hearers  were  not  numerous,  but  veiy  attentive,  and  chiefly 
Church  people.  On  the  27th  of  February  I  preached  at  the 
house  of  Mr.  Craig,  ni  the  township  of  Medo'ite  ;  a  considerable 
number  of  persons  assembled,  and  [  was  informed  that  if  the 
weather  had  not  been  so  cold  and  stormy,  die  eoiigregation 
would  ?»ave  been  larger. 

Having  arrived  at  Penc^tanguishine,  I  preached  twice  there 
on  Sunday  the  3rd  March,  to  a  fine  congregation  ;  all  belonging 
to  the  Naval  and  ^[ilitary  establishments  atte.i  ted— four  children 
v^ere  baptized.  At  Penetanguishiue  I  remained  with  Mr. 
Woodin,  Lieutenant  li.lN.,  M'ho  treated  me  with  much  hospi- 
tality and  kiudne.'js,  and  introduced  me  to  all  the  officers  and 
I)rincipal  inhabitants.  I  also  visited  Mr.  Mitchell,  and  other 
Protestants,  who  live  in  a  village  in  the  townshij)  of  Tiny,  three 
mile:;  from  the  military  establishment.  The  majority  of  the 
inhabitants  are  Roman  Catholics,  who  formerly  resided  on 
Drunuuond's   Island,  and    they  are   occasionally   visited   by   a

Clergyman  of  their  Cliurcli.  I  was  requested  by  some  sick 
persons  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Penelanguishine  to  administer 
to  them  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper.  When  I  was 
returning  from  Penctanguishine,  I  found  the  snow  very  deep ; 
the  weatner  was  severely  cold,  and  travelling  difficult.  I  regret 
that  I  was  able  to  labour  so  little  among  tiie  new  settlers  in 
Medonte  and  Oro.  It  was  my  intention  to  go  to  the  Indian 
village  at  Coldwater  and  the  Narrows ;  but  it  has  been  con- 
sidered unsafe,  during  the  winter,  especially  for  strangers,  to 
travel  on  the  ice  ;  and  on  account  of  the  badness  of  the  roads, 
and  the  depth  of  the  snow,  it  is  very  diificult  to  piiss  on  horse- 
back through  these  wild  and  uncultivated  regions.  I  thought 
it  better  to  put  off  my  visit  to  Coldwater  until  the  summer,  when 
I  shall  be  better  able  also  to  visit  the  inhabitants  of  Oro  and 
Medonte  generally. 

Having  returned  to  Captain  Oliver's,  in  Oro,  I  preached  on 
the  10th  of  Marcli  at  Kempenfelt  Bay,  to  a  small,  but  very  atten- 
tive congregation.  In  the  evening,  I  performed  Divine  Service 
again  in  Innisfil,  at  Mr.  McConkeys,  and  though  the  settlers  are 
comparatively  few,  tlie  hearers  were  numerous. 

On  the  Wednesday  following,  I  preached  in  the  township  of 
Essa,  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Blackstock,  about  eight  miles  west 
from  the  Penetanguishine  road.  The  congregation  consisted  of 
about  sixty  people,  who  reside  in  Essa  and  Innisfil.  Eight 
children  were  baptized  in  this  neighbourhood.  Here  I  was 
desired  to  administer  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  to  a 
person  who  has  been  long  sick.  When  I  visited  her,  a  number 
of  the  neighbours  came  in,  which  afforded  me  an  opportunity  of 
addressing  them  on  the  subject  of  religion.  While  in  Essa  I 
began  to  feel  the  effects  of  a  severe  cold,  and  for  several  days 
past  I  have  been  able  to  do  little  or  nothing.  I  feel  thankful, 
however,  that  I  am  now  much  better,  and  I  hope,  by  God's 
assistance,  to  preach  in  Gwillimbury  to-morrow. 

I  am.  Reverend  Sir, 

Your  obliged  humble  servant,

TO  THE  REV.  CHARLES  MATHEWS, 

SECRETARY  TO  THE  SOCIETY,  &amp;C. 

York,  \st  July,  1833. 

Reverend  Sir, — Permit  me  to  acquaint  you  with  my  pro- 
ceedings, since  I  last  had  the  honour  of  addressing  you. 

My  health  being  much  improved,  I  read  prayers,  and 
preached  on  the  22d  March  to  a  very  attentive  congregation  in 
the  township  of  West  Gwillimbury.  The  people  there  assured 
me,  that  they  were  determined,  if  possible,  to  have  a  Church 
erected. 

On  the  following  Sunday,  I  performed  the  morning  service 
in  the  western  part  of  Tecumseth,  and  baptized  five  children. 
The  congregation  consisted  chiefly  of  Church  people.  In  the 
evening,  I  read  prayers  and  preached  at  the  Methodist  Meeting- 
house in  another  part  of  the  same  township.  The  congregation 
was  large,  and  the  people  were  principally  English.  I  was  happy 
to  find  that  the  inhabitants  of  Tecumseth  had  been  employing

of  Ju'  j)roi)Osed  C'liureh. 

Ilsiviiig  arrivud  in  the  township  of  Mono,  I  pt'ifornioil 
Divino  Service  on  Friday,  2J)th  March,  at  the  liouse  of  Mr. 
Cobean,  who  resides  on  the  seventh  concetision.  The  hearers 
were  very  nnmerous  and  attentive.  Many  persons  attendc*! 
from  the  township  of  AdjaUi,  which  ^'^  sitnated  immediately  on 
the  east  side  of  Alcao.  I  baptized  eigliteen  children  on  that 
occasion.  In  Mono,  the  peophi  are  principally  Protestants. 
One-luilf  of  the  inhabitants  of  Adjala  are  Roman  Catholics. 
The  nieml)ers  of  the  Church  in  these  townships  are  exceedin«;ly 
zealous,  and  are  very  solicitous  for  a  resident  Clergyman.  The 
frame  of  a  Church  was  raised  last  summer  in  a  central  situation, 
but  without  aid  fi'om  some  source  it  will  be  long,  I  fear,  before 
they  can  accomjdish  ther  undertaking.  I  was  informed  by  the 
inhabitants,  that  the  Archdeacon  of  York  first  performed  the 
service  of  our  Church  in  Mono,  and  that  they  yet  entertain 
feelings  of  gratitude  for  his  kindness  in  visiting  their  remote 
townsliip  at  so  early  a  i)oriod. 

From  Mono  I  proceeded  to  Mulmur,  and  performed  Divine 
Service  there  on  Saturday,  30th  March.  I  had  no  intention  of 
visiting  Mulmur  on  that  occasion,  as  I  supposed  the  settlers  to 
be  very  few:  but  a  member  of  the  Church,  who  resides  there, 
came  and  requested  me  to  preach  in  that  township  and  baptize 
the  children.  About  fifty  persons  assembled,  and  twelve  children 
were  baptized. 

Having  returned  to  Albion,  I  read  prayers  and  preached  on 
the  second  concession.  Though  the  weather  was  exceedingly 
fine,  the  congregation  was  not  large,  as  general  information  had 
not  been  circulated  among  the  inhabitants.  On  that  occasion 
three  children  were  baptized. 

Having  arrived  at  Newmarket,  I  performed  divine  service 
there  on  Good  Friday.  The  congregation  was  respectable  and 
attentive.  On  Easte/-day,  I  preached  at  the  same  place  to  a 
large  assemblage  of  people.  On  the  following  Tuesday,  as  I  wa.s 
returning  to  the  township  of  Albion,  I  read  prayt'is  and  prtiiched 
to  a  small,  but  attentive  congregation,  and  itaptized  a  child  in  the 
township  of  King.  I  performed  divine  vice  and  preached  at 
the  different  places  on  the  south  side  of  .  limi,  and  baptized 
several  children.  On  the  Sunday,  the  congregatioM  was  very 
numerous,  consisting  chiefly  of  emigrants,  who  have  lately  settled 
in  that  neighbourhood.  I  am  informed,  that  there  a.  e  about 
nineti/  famiUes  professing  to  be  Episcopalians,  within  a  circle  of 
about  five  miles  round  the  residence  of  Mr.  Terry,  on  the  south- 
west corner  of  Albion.  But  it  is  to  be  apprehended,  that  they 
will  not  long  retain  their  attachment  to  our  Church,  if  they  re- 
main destitute  of  her  ministraticns. 

As  I  continued  my  journey  to  Caledon,  I  read  prayers  and 
preached  at  Mr.  Wood's,  on  the  fourth  concession  of  Chingua- 
cousy,  east  of  Hurontario  street.    Above  twenty  persons  wer&lt; 
present,  and  one  child  was  baptized. 

Having  arrived  at  Caledon,  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  there, 
at  the  house  of  Mr.  Dodds,  &gt;\  ho  resides  near  the  centre  of  the 
township.    The  congregation  was  large  and  attentive.

On  Sunday,  21st  Ai)ril,  as  a  house  could  not  bo  obtained 
sufficiently  large  for  tliecongrcLMtion,  I  perfornied  divine  service 
in  the  open  air,  and  had  a  pulpit  made  of  the  branches  of  ever- 
greens. Ten  children  were  baptized.  It  has  been  ascertained 
that  about  forty  families  of  Cliurch  people  live  near  together,  in 
the  centre  of  Caledon.  After  divine  service  I  visited  a  Sunday 
scliool  and  exaniiuod  the  children,  A  liumber  of  young  men  also 
attended,  whom  I  heard  read  in  the  New  Testament.  On  the 
foUowing  day,  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  in  the  townsliii.  of 
Erin,  which  is  in  tlie  Oore  district.  The  hearers  were  numerouH 
and  attenti  .e,  and  chiefly  English. 

Having  returned  to  tlie  township  of  Chinguacousy,  I  {ior- 
formed  divine  service  at  thi'ee  different  places,  and  baptized  a 
considerable  number  of  children.  On  Sunday,  20th  April,  I  read 
prayers  and  preaciied  in  Mr.  Nixon's  barn,  on  the  fourth  conces- 
sion of  that  township,  to  a  large  assemblage  of  ])eople,  who  are 
said  to  be  principally  Episcopalians.  They  are  very  anxious  to 
have  a  Church  erected.  I  am  informed  that  above  dghty  famiUci 
belonging  to  the  Church  reside  in  that  neighbourhood,  not  more 
•■.han  three  and  a  half  miles  fi'om  the  site  of  the  proposed  Church. 

A  resident  Clergyman  is,  perhajjs,  not  more  wanted  in  any 
])art  of  the  Home  district  than  in  Chinguacousy. 

On  the  following  Sunday,  I  road  prayers  and  lectured  near 
tlu?  line  between  Chinguacousy  and  the  Gore  of  Toronto,  to  a 
numerous  congregation.  In  that  neighbourhood  the  people  were 
not  permitted  to  assemble  in  the  school  for  the  performance  of 
divine  service  !  This  exasperated  not  only  the  Episcopalians, 
but  also  many  persons  belonging  to  other  denominations.  In 
the  evening,  I  again  read  prayers,  and  lectured  in  another  part 
of  the  Gore  of  Toronto  to  a  very  attentive  congregation.  The 
members  of  our  Church  are  said  to  be  very  numerous  in  this 
neighbourhood. 

On  Sunday,  lOtli  May,  I  performed  divine  service  twice  in 
Christ's  Church,  Mimico,  and  baptized  two  children. 

Having  proceeded  to  the  township  of  Whitby,  I  preached 
there  on  Whit-Sunday,  at  the  meeting-house.  The  congregation, 
though  considerable,  was  not  so  large  as  I  expected.  General 
notice  had  not  been  given  to  the  people.  I  was  informed  that 
the  friends  of  the  Churcli  in  that  township  had  held  meetings 
respecting  the  erection  of  a  Church  ;  but  thai  nothing  more  had 
been  done  to  promote  that  objerrt  on  account  of  some  disagree- 
nuMit  which  had  arisen  among  the  inhabitants  respecting  the  sito 
of  the  building. 

On  Sunday  the  2n(l  June,  I  read  prayers  and  preached  twice 
at  Bowmauville,  in  the  township  of  Darlington.  Though  the 
weather  was  extremely  unfavourable,  both  services  were  well 
attended.  A  considerable  number  of  English  people  resident 
this  village,  and  some  of  them  expressed  to  me  their  solicitude 
for  a  resident  Clergynuin.  On  the  Monday  evening  following,  I 
read  prayers  and  lectured  at  the  same  place.  Abotit  forty  people 
were  present,  and  one  child  baptized.  [  was  requested,  the  next 
day,  to  oflicisite  at  the  funeral  of  one  of  the  inhabitants  of  the 
village.  The  people  seemed  affected,  and  I  trust  they  wer« 
edified  by  a  lecture  which  I  delivered  on  that  occasion.     This 


.1 


37 


was  the  first  interment  iu  the  burial  j^rouiid  at  the  site  of  the 
])roj)o.seil  Church. 

Having  returned  to  the  township  of  Pickering,  I  performed 
the  morning  service  in  Mr.  Leys's  barn,  near  the  Kin&lt;;ston  road, 
'I'he  congro&lt;,'ation  was  numerous  and  attentive.  It  was  supposed 
that  about  two  hundred  people  were  present.  I  l)aptized  six 
children  on  that  occasion.  Afterwards  1  rode  seven  or  eij^ht 
miles  in  a  northern  direction,  and  performed  the  evenin^i;  service 
in  a  scliool.  The  congregation  consisted  of  about  a  hundred 
persons.  As  many  of  my  hearers  seemed  unaccustomed  to  our 
form  of  worship,  I  explained  to  them  some  parts  of  the  liturgy. 
Here  I  was  treated  with  much  civility  and  kindness  by  Mr.  Vin- 
cent, and  others  of  the  inhabitants.  From  Pickering  I  i)roceeded 
to  the  township  of  Markham,  and  read  prayers  and  preached  in 
the  scliool  at  the  village,  on  the  eighth  concession.  The  weather 
being  unfavourable,  the  congregation  was  small. 

On  Sunday  the  ICth  June,  1  performed  the  morning  service 
at  the  same  place,  preached  to  about  a  hundred  people,  and 
baptized  two  children.  In  the  afternoon,  I  preached  in  the  Rev. 
Mr.  Mayerhofter's  Church  to  a  numerous  and  attentive  congre- 
gation. As  many  of  the  inhabitants  of  Markham  understood  the 
( f erman  better  than  the  English  tongue,  Mr.  Mayerhoffer  reads 
prayers  and  preaches  to  them  alternately  in  both  languages. 

Uaving  returned  to  York,  I  officiated  on  the  two  following 
Sundays  at  the  Churches  in  the  township  of  Etobicoke. 
I  remain,  with  much  respect,  Reverend  Sir, 

Your  most  obedient  servant,

TO  THE  REV.  CI'  '  RLES  MATHEWS, 

SECRETARY    TO    TxIE    SOCIETY,    &amp;C. 

Penetamjuishine,  22Hd  October^  XS'A'S. 

Reverend  Sir, — As  it  will  probably  be  a  considerable  time 
before  I  shall  be  able  to  return  to  York,  I  beg  leave  briefly  to 
inform  you  on  this  occasion,  how  I  have  been  employed  since  I 
last  had  the  pleasure  of  seeing  you.  I  trust  I  shall  be  enabled 
to  give  you  a  more  minute  account  of  iny  excursions  and  labours. 

Ou  Sunday  morning  the  7th  of  July,  I  visited  a  Sunday 
school  in  Chinguacousy,  whic  i  is  in  connexion  with  the  Sunday 
school  society  in  the  diocese  of  Quebec,  and  which  I  was  happy 
to  find  had  been  opened  since  I  left  that  township  in  May  last. 
Forty-six  children  were  present,  most  of  whom  I  heard  read  in 
the  New  Testament,  and  recite  a  part  of  the  Church  Catechism. 
Afterwards  I  read  prayers  and  preached  to  about  one  hundred 
and  forty  people,  baptized  two  children,  and  administered  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  to  eleven  communicants,  who 
are  members  of  the  Church. 

On  the  following  Tuesday  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  to 
between  thirty  and  forty  persons,  and  baptized  two  children  at 
the  house  of  Mr,  Terry,  in  Albion.  In  the  evening  I  visited  a 
sick  person  residing  in  the  neighbourhood. 

On  Friday  the  I2th  of  July,  I  preached  in  Mono  to  about 
four  hundred  people,  and  baptized  ten  children.  The  Orange- 
T  .en,  who  are  numerous  in  that  part  of  the  country,  attended  ;

and  it  wns  on  account  of  tlieir  anniinl  meeting  on  that  day  that 
HO  many  of  the  inhal)itunts  asseinblod.  On  the  Sunday  mornin/j; 
fol'owing,  I  visited  a  Hunday  school  which  had  been  established 
in  Mono  since  I  left  tliat  township  last  sprin&lt;if.  Though  the 
weather  was  wet,  forty  children  were  present ;  the  total  number 
in  attendance  was  fifty.  Uoth  the  teachers  and  children  seemed 
much  encouraged  by  a  number  of  useful  books  wiiich  had  been 
given  to  the  school  by  the  Lord  Bishop. 

About  a  hundred  peojjle  attended  divine  service  in  the  fore- 
noon ;  three  children  were  baptized,  and  seventeen  persons  re- 
ceived the  Holy  Communion.  It  has  been  ascertained  that 
about  slMif  families  belonging  to  our  Church  reside  in  a  circle  of 
three  or  tour  miles  round  the  site  of  the  Church  which  is  erect- 
ing in  Mono.  A  faithful  and  exemplary  minister  is  much 
wanted  tliere.  Many  of  the  inhabitants,  I  fear,  pay  little  regard 
to  the  Sabbath,  and  the  religious  education  ot  their  children  ; 
and  there,  as  in  other  parts,  intemperance  is  a  source  of  much 
evil.  A  considerable  number  of  Presbyterians  reside  in  Mono, 
who  seem  to  be  friendly  peoi^le  ;  from  some  of  them  I  received 
much  kindness.  The  land  in  those  piirts  is  elevated,  and  when 
cultivated,  the  conn  ti'y  will  bo  picturesque  and  beautiful.  The 
soil  is  sandy  and  dry  ;  the  surface  is  uneven  and  undulating,  and 
many  of  the  euMnences  command  very  entertaining  and  pleasing 
prospects. 

Having  pi'oceeded  to  Caledon,  I  preached  at  the  school  in 
the  cent"  of  that  township,  on  Tuesday  the  16th  of  July.  Three 
children  were  baptized  ;  and  though  the  weather  was  very  un- 
favourable, about  a  hundred  people  attended.  After  divine  ser- 
vice, one  of  the  members  of  tiie  Church  gave  notice  tliat  there 
would  be  a  meeting  of  tlie  inhabitants,  to  take  into  consideration 
the  expediency  of  erecting  a  Church.  At  the  same  time  I  was 
requested  to  administer  the  Sacrament  on  my  ne;it  visit  to 
Caledon. 

On  the  Friday  evening  following,  I  read  prayers  and  lec- 
tured in  the  townsliip  of  Chinguacousy.  About  thirty  persons 
attended,  who  appeared  very  devout  and  attentive.  On  Sunday 
the  21st  July  I  visited  a  Sunday  school  which  had  been  lately 
established  near  the  line  between  the  townsliip  of  Toronto  and 
the  Gore.  About  forty  children  were  prcient,  some  of  whom  I 
heard  recite  portions  of  Sciipture,  and  read  in  tlie  New  Testa- 
ment. When  I  addressed  them  on  the  subject  of  religion  they 
listened  with  great  attention.  After  the  school  was  closed,  [ 
read  prayers  and  preached  to  a  numerous  assemblage  of  people 
in  Mr.  Ilenry  Bell's  barn.  It  was  supposed  that  between  eighty 
and  a  hundred  persons  were  present.  Three  children  wore  laap- 
tized.  In  the  afternoon  I  rode  across  the  Gore  of  Toronto,  to  the 
northern  part  of  Etobicoke  ;  and  Mr.  Clarke,  of  Chingiuicousy, 
was  kind  enough  to  accompany  me  most  of  the  way.  The  road 
was  very  bad,  and  the  weather  extremely  hot.  Having  reached 
the  appointed  i)lace  of  meeting  rather  later  than  I  had  intended, 
1  found  a  congregation  of  about  a  hundred  people,  who  were 
principally  English.  I  explained  to  them  several  parts  of  the 
Church  ."iorvice,  and  lectured  on  the  Lord's  prayer  as  recorded 
in  the  gospel  by  St.  Matthew.     Four  children  were  baptized.

On  Saturday  the  27th  of  .Inly,  I  visited  several  of  the 
inenibors  and  friends  of  the  Chuieh  residinpfin  the  northern  part 
of  Scarborough,  who  expressed  their  solicitude  for  the  continu- 
ance of  our  labours  anionji;  tlieni.  A  nuijority  of  the  people  there 
are  said  to  bo  Pipiscopalians  ;  and  I  was  happy  to  meet  with 
some  of  them  who  appeared  to  be  persons  of  deviided  piety.  Tl»e 
following  day  being  Sunday,  I  i)erfornied  divine  service  and 
preaclied  twice  in  the  school  house.  A  large  assemblage  of  the 
iniiabitants  attended  both  services.  In  the  morning  it  wjis 
sui)posed  there  might  be  about  seventy,  and  in  the  evening  about 
a  hundred  persons  present. 

As  J  passed  on  northward  through  the  township  of  Mark- 
ham,  I  was  agreeably  surprised  by  the  appearance  of  the  Uev. 
Mr.  Alayerhott'er's  Church,  as  I  was  not  aware  that  my  road  led 
to  it,  and  also  becaiue  it  is  now  much  improved  by  being  painted 
white.  There  I  met  with  Mr  Moore,  who  is  employed  by  the 
Bishop  as  a  Catechist.  I  requested  him  to  read  j)rayers  and  a 
sermon  once  a  fortnight  in  the  congregation  on  the  north  side  of 
tlie  township  of  Scarborougli,  the  jjoople  in  that  neighbourhood 
being  then  destitute  of  the  ministrations  of  the  Church. 

As  I  travelled  from  Pickering  to  Uxbridge,  I  found  the 
country  rather  thinly  settled  ;  much  of  the  land  there  is  high 
and  ridgy,  and  covered  thinly  with  pines.    There  is  a  consider- 
able settlement  on  the  nortii  side  of  the  township  of  Uxbridge. 
The  land  in  that  part  is  said  to  be  of  rather  an  inferior  quality  ; 
springs  of  water  are  abundant  ;  and  though  the  soil  is  sandy  and 
apparently  poor,  yet  the  maple  trees  wliicii  it  produces  are  neither 
small  nor  few.     There  I  spent  the  first  day  of  August  in  visiting 
from  house  to  house,  and  conversing  with  the  inhabitants  chiefly 
on  religious  topics.    On  the  following  Saturday,  I  read  prayers 
and  lectured  on  the  nature  and  necessity  of  repentance.    Between 
thirty  and  forty  people  attended,  and  one  child  was  baptized. 
The  next  day  1  performed  the  morning  service  in  the  school ; 
explained  some  parts  of  the  liturgy,  and  lectured  on  thf*  subject 
of  prayer.    The  congregation  consisted  of  between  fifty  and  sixty 
persons,  who  were  very  attentive.    An  adult  was  baptized,  whom 
I  had  previously  examined,  and  who  I  was  happy  to  find,  enter- 
tained very  scriptural  opinions  on  the  subject  of  baptism.    In 
the  evening  the  congregation  was  nearly  as  large  as  in  the 
morning,  and  I  thought  more  attentive.    It  is  said  that  about  one 
half  of  the  inhabitants  of  Uxbridge  are  Quakers,  who  are  now 
divided  into  two  sects.     The  rest  of  the  people  are  of  various 
persuasions,  and  some  of  them  profess  to  belong  to  no  particular 
denomination  of  christians.     A  Sunday  school  had  lately  been 
opened  there,  and  some  of  the  Quakers  permitted  their  children 
to  attend  it.    I  endeavoured  to  encourage  the  teachers  to  con- 
tinue their  exertions,  and  gave  them  a  few  copies  of  the  New 
Testament  and  other  books    suitable   for  the   children.      The 
numher  of  Episcopalians  in  Uxbridge,  though  small,  is  greater 
than  I  expected. 

On  Sunday  the  lltli  of  August,  I  read  prayers  and  preached 
in  a  barn  belonging  to  Mr.  P.  St.  John,  of  the  township  of  Brock, 
to  about  a  hundred  people,  and  ba])tized  a  child.  In  the  evening, 
J  preached  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Stepl.enson,  in  the  same  towu-

ship,  to  about  50  persons.  As  I  romainod  a  considerable  time  in 
IJrock,  I  had  frccpient  opportunities  of  conversing  with  the  in- 
habitants. It  appeared  from  their  statements,  that  certain 
individuals  had  employed  their  influence  to  induce  the  members 
of  the  Church  to  8ej)arate  from  our  communion  ;  but  their 
efforts  had  quite  a  contrarv  tendency.  Since  undisjjuised  oppo- 
sition has  been  made,  it  is  hoped  that  the  real  friends  or  the 
Church  are  on  their  puard,  and  will  not  be  easily  led  astray. 
On  the  13th  of  Au/^ust,  I  read  i)rayers  and  lectured  at  Mr. 
Humphreys,  and  baptized  a  child.  About  forty  poo])le  were 
present.  On  the  Saturday  following,  I  preached  and  baptized  u 
child  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Cowan.  Between  thirty  and  forty 
p'^ople  attended.  The  next  morninp,  after  riding  about  six  or 
stv^en  miles,  I  performed  the  morning  service,  preached  and 
baptized  three  children  in  a  barn  near  the  township  line  be- 
tween Brock  and  Mariposa.  The  congregation  was  numerous 
and  attentive.  The  morning  service  being  ended,  I  proceeded 
a  few  miles  in  a  western  direction,  and  road  prayers  aad  lectured 
at  the  house  of  Mr.  McPhaden.  About  thirty  persons  were 
jresent,  nearly  all  Presbyterians,  from  the  Highlands  of  Scot- 
and.  Being  informed  that  some  of  them  had  not  much  know- 
edge  of  the  English  language,  I  endeavoured  to  address  them  in 
as  plain  and  simple  a  style  as  possible,  and  afterwards  requested 
Mr.  McPhaden  to  add  a  brief  explanation  of  what  I  had  delivered 
in  their  own  tongne.  This  he  did  in  a  very  easy  and  animated 
manner.  On  the  next  Sunday  following,  I  preached  to  a  nume- 
rous assemblage  of  people,  in  a  building  then  in  an  unfinished 
state,  near  Mr.  St.  John's.  It  was  sui)posed  that  about  two 
hundred  persons  were  present.  Thirty  commnnkants  received  tho 
Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  on  that  occasion.  A  large 
majority  of  the  inhabitants  of  Brock  are  from  Ireland,  and  have 
been  brought  up  in  our  Church.  I  had  much  interesting,  and, 
I  trust,  edifying  conversation  with  them  on  religious  subjects. 
They  repeatedly  expressed  their  anxiety  for  a  resident  Clergy- 
man, and  one  person,  I  believt  a  native  of  this  country,  assured 
me  that  he  would  willingly  give  five  or  six  acres  of  land  for  the 
site  of  a  Church,  if  a  Clergy  Reserve  could  not  be  obtained  in  a 
suitable  situation. 

From  13rock  I  travelled  to  Thorah,  and  preached  at  two 
different  placos  in  that  township,  on  Sunday  the  first  day  of 
September,  to  respectable  and  attentive  congregations.  Two 
children  were  baptized,  and  seven  or  eight  persons  received  ilio 
Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper. 

As  I  passed  along  the  shore  of  Lake  Simcoe,  toward  Geor- 
gina,  I  visited  Mr.  Turner,  who  received  me  with  much  kindness. 
I  baptized  his  two  youngest  children.  On  the  following  Wen- 
nesday,  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Lloyd, 
and  baptized  a  child  :  but  few  people  attended,  as  the  weather 
was  very  unfavourable.  The  next  day,  I  visited  Mr.  Robert 
Johnson,  brother  to  Lieut.  Johnson,  of  Georgina,  and  baptized 
his  two  children.  On  Sunday  the  8th  of  September,  I  performed 
Divine  Service  and  preached  in  the  township  of  Georgina,  at 
Mr.  Bourchier's,  about  a  mile  distant  from  the  Lake.  The 
congregation  was  respectable  and  attentive,  but  not  so  numerous

preached  at  the  house  of  Mr.  .laekson,  to  fifteen  jjoople. 
the  next  Tuesday  after,  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  to  a 
thirtv  people,  principally  emigrants  from  England,  and  members 
of  tin'  Church.  They  seeme&lt;l  to  join  in  l)ivine  Service  with 
devotion,  and  their  singing  was  agreeable.  On  Sunday  the  loth 
(»f  September,  I  again  preached  to  a  large  congregation,  bap- 
tized five  children,  and  administered  the  Saciament  of  the 
Lord's  Sui)per  to  ten  persons.  It  was  supposed  that  the  congre- 
pition  consisted  of  hetween  eighty  and  ninety  people,  nearly  all 
Kpiscojjalians.  Their  serious  and  devout  behaviour,  while  en- 
I'tufcd  in  public  worship,  was  highly  exemidary  and  pleasing.  A 
i(&gt;si(lent  Minister  is  much  wanted  here,  whose  attention  and 
labours  might  for  some  time  be  profitably  divided  between  the 
t(&gt;wnshi])s  of  Georgina  and  Brock. 

Haviuji;  arrived  in  North  (Iwillimbury,  I  found  that  Mr. 
Snially  had  been  kind  enougli  to  make  an  ap])ointment  forme  to 
j»reaci»  in  that  town.ship,  on  Sunday  the  22d  of  Septeml)er.  On 
the  Friday  j)revious,  I  officiated  at  the  funeral  of  Mr.  C.  Smith, 
who  I  was  informed  had  resided  a  number  of  years  in  N(jrth 
(iwillimbury.  A  large  assenjhlage  of  the  inhabitants  attended. 
After  reading  the  funeral  service,  I  addressed  the  peojjle  on 
some  of  the  most  imj)ortant  subjects  of  religion.  On  tiie  Sunday 
the  hearers  were  numerous  and  attentive.  They  api»eared  to 
join  in  the  service  with  devotion,  and  the  members  of  the 
Church,  who  were  comparatively  few  on  that  occasion,  made 
the  responses  in  the  liturgy  audibly. 

On  Monday  the  23d  Se])teinber,  I  travelled  between  North 
(jrwillimbury  and  Tecumseth,  a  distance  of  between  twenty 
and  thirty  miles.  The  next  day  as  I  continued  my  journey  to- 
wards Kempenfeldt  Bay  I  found  the  roads  very  bad  in  seveial 
l)laces,  but  the  weather  was  exceedingly  fine,  and  the  woods, 
then  arrayed  in  their  beautiful  foliage  of  various  hues,  presented 
a  very  pleasing  aspect.  Having  spent  the  night  at  Mr.  M'Con- 
koy's  hospitable  residence,  I  proceeded  on  the  following  morn- 
ing round  the  head  of  Kempenfeldt  Bay.  The  land,  at  its  extre- 
mity, being  very  swampy,  renders  travelling  on  horseback  rather 
difficult.  There  I  am  informed  a  toAvn  is  to  be  built  called 
Bai  .-ie,  and  several  houses  are  already  erected.  Perhaps  a  more 
convenient  and  pleasing  situation  could  not  have  been  selected. 
Having  visited  several  families  on  the  north  side  of  the  Bay,  I 
read  prayers  and  preached  at  Mr.  Mann's  on  Sunday,  29tli  Sep- 
tember. It  was  thought  that  about  seventy  people  attended, 
and  five  children  were  baptized.  In  the  evening  I  again  read 
prayers  and  lectured  at  the  head  of  the  bay  to  about  fifty  people, 
who  were  very  attentive  ;  one  child  was  baptized.  On  that  c- 
casion  the  peoi)le  assembled  in  a  large  log-house,  which  wu.s 
then  in  an  unfinished  state,  the  roof  being  only  p.artly  covered 
with  shingles.  The  congregation  in  that  neighbourhood  would 
have  been  much  more  numerous  if  there  had  not  been  an  ex- 
tremely high  wind,  which  so  agitated  the  waters  of  the  bay, 
that  few  ventured  to  cross  it  in  boats.

On  TuoNduy*  tlu'  first  day  of  October,  an  I  procctHlod  ulon^ 
the  l*L'iiotunf,Miisliine  road,  I  road  |)rayorH  and  It'tturt'd  at  the 
school  hoiiH&lt;(  in  Vospra,  near  Mr.  Whito'N  ;  about  twenty 
persons  attendeil,  ami  two  ehildrt^n  were  ba|)ti/ed.  In  tlie  evt  n- 
in^  I  a&gt;,'ain  read  prayers  and  h'ctured  at  Mr.  Crai^'VJn  Medonte; 
about  thirty  people  W(»re  present,  and  two  ehildren  were  bap- 
tized. 'J'he  next  day  I  arrived  at  C'oldwater,  and  met  with  a 
eordial  reeeptionfroni  Captain  Anderson.  In  erossinif  the  town- 
ship of  Medonte  I  found  the  road  not  much  travelled,  and  very 
swanjpy  in  some  nlaces,  and  the  weather  bein^  oxeeedin^^ly  wet 
and  cold,  travelling,'  was  disa{,'reeable.  As  this  is  the  hun^'ii^ 
and  fishing'  season  most  of  the  Indians  had  l(&gt;ft  their  dwellings. 
With  those  who  remained  at  home  I  had  fre(|uont  and  interest- 
ing? conversation ;  and  in  Captain  Anderson  1  had  both  on  able 
and  willing?  intei'preter.  About  two  thirds  of  tin;  Indians  of 
('oldwater  are  Protestants,  and  the  rest  profess  to  bo  Homan 
('atholics.  On  Sunday  the  (lt\i  of  October,  I  read  })rayers  and 
preached  in  the  school  to  the  white  people,  who  are  not  yet 
numerous  in  the  neifj^hbourhood  of  Coldwater  ;  about  twenty  of 
th«'  Indians  attended  at  the  same  time,  and  were  very  attentive. 
In  the  evening?  1  officiated  again,  and  explained  the  Lord's 
l*rayer  to  the  Indians.  Very  few  of  the  Indian  children  are  in 
attendance  at  present  at  the  school,  as  tboy  usually  accompany 
their  parents  in  hunting  excursions.  Their  present  teacher, 
Mr.  Robertson,  seems  to  be  an  excellent  person  ;  several  of  the 
Induins  have  lately  been  afflicted  with  the  measles.  One  morn- 
ing I  aceoini&gt;anied  Dr.  Darling  when  he  went  to  see  some  of  his 
patients  ;  I  observed  one  very  old  Indian  sitting  on  a  bed  with 
liis  nose,  ears,  and  forehead  ornamented  with  trinkets,  whom  1 
asked  several  questions.  He  told  me  that  ho  knew  nothing 
about  a  future  state  of  existence  ;  that  he  had  never  committed 
any  sin  ;  and  never  felt  remorse  of  conscience ;  he  professed, 
however,  to  believe  in  the  "  Great  Spirit ;"  and  the  reason  which 
lie  assigned  for  doing  so  was  this  : — "  Tliat  it  was  intimated  to 
him,  when  very  young,  in  a  dream,  that  he  should  live  to  be  old 
and  grey-headed,  which  had  been  fulfilled."  This  man  informed 
me  that  he  had  once  been  a  Roman  Catholic.  Some  of  the 
Indians  paid  me  numerous  visits,  and  John  Aisence,  the  Chief, 
who  left  the  Methodists  and  joined  the  Roman  Catholics,  gene- 
rally contrived  to  be  present  on  such  occasions.  It  appears  to 
me  that  the  Indians  of  Coldwater  are  far  from  being  free  from 
the  danger  of  being  induced  to  join  the  Romanists,  and  I  have 
done  all  in  my  power  to  fortify  them  against  so  great  an  evil, 
and  to  confirm  them  in  real  Christian  principles.  I  was  happy 
to  find  that  several  of  them  had  acquired  a  considerable  degree 
of  religious  knowledge ;  but  there  is  yet  ample  room  for  im- 
provement. The  state  of  the  Indians  has  lately  been  to  me  a 
subject  of  much  reflection,  and  I  have  more  to  say  to  you  in  re- 
gard to  the  interviews  which  I  had  with  John  Aisence,  an&lt;' 
others  of  the  Indians,  at  Captain  Anderson's,  than  I  can  conve- 
niently communicate  on  this  occasion. 

On  Sunday  the  I3th  of  October,  I  read  prayers  and  preached 
in  Southern  Orillia,  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Samson,  near  the  village

Coniparativoly  few  of  the  Indians  heinty  at  hoine,  not  above 
sixty  or  seveiity  of  tiicni  atti-ncb-d,  o\w  ot  whom  interpreted  my 
lecturo  to  his  brothnMi.  They  apjx'urod  to  be  very  attentive*  and 
devout,  a!id  san^  well  ;  some  ot  the  females  w(&gt;re  rather  noisy 
in  time  of  prayer,  but  not  to  n  jyreat  extreme.  On  tiie  followinj; 
morniuff  I  visited  the  Indian  seliool,  but  there  were  scarcely  any 
childn-n  in  attendance,  as  most  of  them  luul  gone  with  their 
parents  into  tlie  forests.  The  site  of  the  villa},'e  is  admirable.  ^ 
The  cottaires,  which  are  built  of  lof,'s,  stand  near  each  other  on 
thesumn,,t  ofaji^entlo  &lt;leclivity,  fronting  a  beautiful  bay,  fmm 
which  the  village  has  a  very  neat  appearance.  1  had  no  opjior- 
tunity  of  conversing  with  the  Indians  of  the  Narrows,  but 
Yellowhead,  one  of  tlio  principal  Chiefs,  having  attended  Divine 
Service,  afterwards  assured  Captain  Anderson  that  he  was 
highly  pleased  with  the  lecture. 

IJeing  detained  longer  in  Orillin  by  bad  weather  than  I 
expected,  it  was  not  till  Friday  the  IHth  October,  that  I  reached 
I'enetanguishine.  On  the  Sunc'ay  following,  J  read  prayers  and 
preaclied  to  a  largo  congregation  in  a  room  at  tlu^  liarracks. 
About  twelve  persons  received  the  llolv  Communion  ;  one  adult 
and  three  children  were  baptized.  As  the  soldiers  here  are 
chiefly  Uoman  Catholics,  few  of  them  attended  Divine  Hervice. 
The  congregation,  however,  amounted  to  between  seventy  and 
eighty  people,  who  are  principally  members  of  our  Church. 
About  fifty  jjcrsons  attended  the  evening  service  at  the  same 
place.  The  next  day  I  visited  Mr.  Rawson,  who  resides  on  the 
west  side  of  the  Penetapguishine  harbour.  An  on  Sunday  he 
was  unable  to  attend  Divine  Service,  on  account  of  old  age  and 
sickness,  1  administered  to  him  and  his  wife  the  Sacrament  of 
the  Lord's  8ui)per.  Ife  appears  to  be  a  truly  pious  person,  and 
has  long  wished  for  an  opportunity  to  receive  the  lioiy  Com- 
munion. 

Having  returned  to  the  village  on  the  opposite  side  of  the 
bay,  I  visited  some  of  the  inhabitants,  and  baptized  two  children. 
The  people  residing  in  Penetanguishine  and  its  vicinity  are  very 
solicitous  for  a  resident  Minister.  But  in  this  respect  they  do 
not  differ  from  the  inhabitants  of  any  other  part  of  the  country, 
settled  by  Ei)iscopalians,  which  I  have  visited.  I  find  the  spliere 
of  my  labours  to  be  exceedingly  extensive,  and  am  sorry  that  I 
can  visit  each  township  within  it  so  seldom.  I  cannot  but  ex- 
press my  regret  on  this  occasion,  that  so  many  hundreds  of 
persons  professing  to  be  mombers  of  our  Church,  even  in  the 
Home  District,  should  remain  so  long  destitute  of  her  regular 
ministrations.  Notwithstanding  the  supposed  comparative 
paucity  of  Episcopalians  in  this  country,  I  find,  by  experience, 
that  in  the  field  of  my  feeble  exertions,  the  "  harvest  truly  is 
plenteous,  but  the  labourers  are  few." 

I  am,  Reverend  Sir,  your  obedient  humble  servant, 

ADAM  ELLIOT.

(litfiMont  periods,  I  hjivi;  Irtiiisitiitted  to  you,  for  tho  inforiiuilioii 
of  tho  Society. 

On  'l'liurH(hiy,  24th  Octt)h('r,  i  r(&gt;jul  pruyiTs  uii.l  K'ctiire«l  at 
the  house  of  Mr.  .I&lt;(ft's,  who  is  u  iiieinher  of  the  Church,  uiid 
resicU's  nhout  nine  miles  from  I'eiietuii^fuishine.  This  part  of 
the  country  bi'iu^'  thinly  settled,  my  hearers  were  not  numerous. 
On  that  o&lt;;casion  1  hapti/ed  two  children,  oik;  of  whom  was  ten 
und  tln^  other  twelve  years  of  a;,'e  ;  on  e.\aminin^  them  t  was 
happy  to  find,  that  thouj^^h  their  haptism  had  been  loii^  deferred, 
tluiir  reli^'ious  (&gt;ducatioii  had  not  been  ne^dt'cti'd. 

I  performed  &lt;livine  (service  and  pn'ached  tho  next  day  at 
Mr.  /ray's,  in  the  townsiiip  of  Flos,  und  baptized  u  child  ;  the 
weather  bein^'  unfavourable,  the  con/j;rej,'ation  was  small.  After- 
wards 1  continued  my  jourjjey  to  Mr.  Crai^j's  in  the  township  of 
Medonte.  In  the  evening,' some  of  tho  nei^libours  came, desiring 
to  be  ]»resent  at  family  worship,  and  thus  an  opportunity  was 
afforded  of  addressing  them  on  the  subject  of  reli;;U)n. 

On  Hunday,  27th  October,  1  read  [)rayerHand  invached  twice 
at  the  school,  in  the  township  of  Vespra,  and  thou^rh  tho  weatlujr 
was  wot  and  uafavourable,  both  services  wore  well  attended. 
Tho  next  duy,  ns  I  proceo&lt;led  to  Innisfil,  1  baptized  two  children 
near  Ivempenfeldt  Jlay.  On  tho  Wednesday  following,  I  per- 
formed divine  service  and  preached  ut  Mr.  JSl'Conkev's  to  rbout 
sixty  or  seventy  very  attentive  poonle  ;  three  chiblren  vcro 
baptized,  and  eight  persons  received  tne  sacrnment  of  the  liord's 
Supper.  On  Sunday  the  3rd  November,  I  read  i)rayiM's  and 
lectured  in  a  burn  belo.iging  to  Mr.  Mairs,  who  resides  on  the 
Jiinth  concession  of  Tecumseth  ;  five  children  were  baptized. 

It  wassuj)])osedthHt  the  congregation  amounted  to  upwards 
of  a  hundred  and  fifty  people  on  that  occasion.  1  also  performed 
the  evening  service  at  the  samepluce,  which  was  not  ill  attemled. 

On  the  Tuesday  following,  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  at 
the  house  of  Mr.  James  Armstrong,  on  the  seventh  concession 
of  the  same  township  ;  about  fifty  persons  wei'e  present,  and 
two  children  were  baptized. 

Two  days  afterwards,  having  [roceeded  from  Tecumseth  to 
Essa,  I  performed  divine  service  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Perry,  near 
the  line  between  Essa  and  Innisfil.  About  forty  people  attended, 
and  one  child  was  baptized.  In  that  neighbourhood,  I  visited  u 
sick  person  belonging  to  the  church,  who  had  long  been  desirous 
of  receiving  the  Holy  Communion.  Her  religious  sentiments 
api)eared  to  be  truly  scriptural,  and  she  entertained,  I  trust,  a 
sure  and  certain  hope  of  everlasting  life,  through  the  meritu  of 
lier  God  and  Saviour. 

On  Sunday  the  10th  November;  I  read  prayers  and  preached 
to  a  numerous  assemblage  of  people  in  the  township  of  West 
(Twillimbury.  One  child  was  ba])tized,  and  thirty  persons 
received  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper.  It  was  supposed 
that  on  that  occasion  the  congregation  amounted  to  between

JOURNAL,  Foil  ni«:('i:Miu:H,  i»:w. 

On  Sunday  the  1st  of  December,  1  read  |)iayers  aiul  i)reached 
ill  tlu;  township  of  ScarboronL,di,  near  Kensin^'ton  road,  to 
hetween  thirty  and  forty  people.  The  frame  of  the  ('hurch  has 
lately  been  erected  in  that  noi^hlu&gt;urhood,  but  tlu'  people  seem 
to  be  discou ratted,  and  will  not,  I  fear,  be  able  to  finish  it  for 
some  time,  except  assistance  be  afforded  them. 

On  the  Sunday  followinfj;  I  assisted  the  Archdeacon  of  York 
in  the  performance  of  divine  service  at  St.  James's  Church. 

llavinjjf  proceeded  to  the  townshij)  of  Whitby,  J  read 
prayers  and  preached  there  on  Sunday  the  Iflth  of  December,  to 
about  fifty  persons.  As  the  Episcopalians  are  nunierous  in  tluit 
neit,dihourhood,  I  was  at  first  surprised  to  t-ce  so  small  an  assem- 
l)la«j;e,  but  was  afterwards  informed  that  (^'eneral  notice  had  not 
heen  ^ivon. 

Hut  it  must  be  admitted  that  the  members  of  our  Ohnrch, 
in  some  parts  of  the  country,  bein&lt;^  lo'&lt; (J deprived  of  lier  ministra- 
tions, fall  into  carelessness  and  apathy,  and  often  let  occasional 
opl)ortunities  of  uttendinp^  her  services  pass  by  unheeded. 

On  Sunday,  22d  December,  I  performed  Divine  Service  and 
jtreached  at  the  village  of  Uownianville,  to  a  numerous  and 
attentive  congregation.  Notice  had  been  generally  given  to  the 
inhabitants  that  the  Service  of  the  Church  would  b(;  perforniol 
in  the  school  at  eleven  o'clock  in  the  morning,  but  when  I  went 
to  tne  })laco  at  the  appointed  hour  a  Methodist  Preacher  Mas 
addressing  the  congregation:  when  it  was  intinuited  to  him  that 
the  service  of  our  Church  was  to  be  performed,  he  kindly  abridged 
his  ministrations.  After  the  Church  service  was  ended  I  baptized 
a  child.  A  Presbyterian  ^Minister  preached  immediately  after- 
wards. At  six  o'clock  in  the  evening  I  again  read  prayers,  and 
preached  to  a  numerous  congregation.

llavin^r  returned  to  Wliitliy,  I  performed  divine  service  on 
t'liristniiw  Day,  and  preached  to  about  a  hundi-ed  peoi)le,  princi- 
pally Epi.scoi)alians,  from  Ennland  a"''  iiiland.  One  adult  and 
tlirei!  children  were  bai)tized.  Fifteen  persons  received  the 
Holy  Communion.  In  the  eveniii'^  1  a^'ain  read  prayers,  and 
Uuitured  in  tlie  snme  nei^'hhourhood.  The  next  day  I  visited 
some  of  the  members  of  the  Church,  who  re&lt;|ret  their  beinif 
destitute  of  her  re;,ailar  ministrations. 

On  tlie  Saturday  I  returned  to  York,  and  proceeded  oti  the 
following  morninpf  to  the  towns'iip  of  Etobicoke,  and  otHciated 
fo.'  the  llev.  Dr.  Phillips,  at  Weston  Church.  The  confj^rej^ation 
v.'iis  not  numei'ous  but  attentive,  and  seven  persons  received  the 
Hacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper. 


JOURNAL  FOR  JANUARY,  l«:i4. 
On  tlu!  1st  of  January,  I  travelled  between  York  and  the 
(lore  of  To)'ont&lt;).  On  the  next  Sunday  after,  I  perfonuod  divine 
service  and  preaclied  on  the  fourth  concession  of  din^niacousy, 
to  about  sixty  peo})lo — iive persons  received  the  Holy  Communion. 
A  few  of  the  neij4hlK)nrs  assembled  on  the  Monday  eveninj,'  at 
tiie  house  where  1  was  residing,  to  whom  I  explained  a  portion 
of  Scripture.  On  the  following  day  I  visited  several  families  in 
tlu!  neighbourlujod,  and  road  prayers  and  preached  at  night  to 
about  seventy  peo])le. 

On  the  8th  January,  I  proceeded  to  Toronto,  and  travelled 
the  next  day  fi'om  thence  to  I'^squesing.  On  my  arrival  in  the 
latter  township  I  was  visited  by  a  considerable  nnmber  of 
lOpiscopalians,  to  whom  I  delivered  a  short  lecture.  On  the  day 
following  I  visited  from  house  to  house,  and  a  numerous  congre- 
gation having  assembled  in  the  evening,  I  read  prayers  and 
preached.  Ilaving  returned  to  the  township  of  Toronto,  I  i)er- 
formed  divine  service  and  preached  at  Ilurontario  Chuixdi  on 
the  12th  January  :  though  the  weather  was  wet  and  disagreeabU' 
the  congregation  was  large.  The  Church  people  are  numerous 
in  that  neighbourhood,  and  the  Rev.  &amp;lr.  M'Grath  preaches  to 
them  once  a  month.  In  the  evening  1  proceeded  a  few  miles  in 
an  eastern  direction,  read  prayers  and  preached  to  a  numerous 
congregation,  and  baptized  four  children. 

Ilaving  returned  to  the  t(nvnship  of  Esquesing,  I  was  re- 
quested to  attend  a  meeting  of  the  Episcopalians  to  take  into 
coisideration  tlie  ex])ediency  of  building  a  Church.  About  eighty 
p(*Muds  were  subscribed  by  a  few  individuals  who  attended  the 
meeting.  On  the  evening  of  the  16th  a  considerable  number  of 
persons  having  met  together,  and  some  of  them  being  unbaptized, 
1  lectured  them  on  the  nature  and  necessity  of  baptism.  On  the 
Saturday  following  I  examined  three  persons  who  expressed 
tiieir  desire  to  be  baptized. 

On  Sunday  the  19th,  I  performed  divine  service  and  preached 
twice,  at  the  liouse  of  Mr.  Thompson,  to  a  very  numerous  and 
attentive  assemblage  of  people.  Five  children  were  baptized, 
and  twenty-seven  persons  received  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's 
Supper. 

On  Tuesday  the  21st  January,  at  the  house  of  Mr.  A.  Gralmm, 
T  read  j)rayers  and  bai)tized  three  adults,  and  five  children.    On

the  Friday  evening  after  I  preaclied  to  a  few  people  at  the  house 
(if  Mr.  Tlioinpson,  who  resides  near  the  line  between  Ksipiesini; 
and  Krin,  and  baptized  seven  childn?n.  On  the  following'  niorninjj; 
I  baptized  six  children  at  the  same  place,  and  afterwards  pro- 
comled  to  the  centre  of  Caledon.  On  Sunday  the  20th,  I  per- 
formed divine  service  in  that  neif»'hbourhood,  and  thouLrh  the 
weatluM"  was  exceedingly  cohl  and  stormy,  the  con^rej^ation  was 
lari'e.  Two  children  were  baj)tized.  On  the  Tuesday  foUowint^ 
I  read  prayors  and  preached  to  a  numerous  con&lt;j;ref^ation  ;  ad- 
ministeied'the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Su]&gt;per  to  twenty-seven 
persons,  and  baj)tized  a  child.  The  Episcoj)alians  of  Caledon 
express  much  solicitude  for  a  resident  minister,  and  a  Church  to 
assemble  in,  and  look  u])  with  confidence  to  the  heads  of  the 
Church  for  encouraf^ement  and  assistance.* 

.JOURNAL  FOR  FEBRUARY,  1H34. 

Having  returned  to  the  township  of  Chin&lt;&lt;uacousy,  I  i)er- 
toriiied  Divine  Service  and  ])reached  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Nixon 
to  about  a  hundred  and  fifty  people,  on  Sunday  the  2d  February. 
Two  childrca  were  bai)tized,  J  also  read  prayers  and  preached 
on  the  followin&lt;^  Tuesday  evenin*,^,  on  the  fourth  concession,  to 
a  numerous  congregation,  and  baptized  two  children.  On  Fri- 
day the  7th  February,  I  retui-ned  to  the  Gore  of  Toronto,  and 
l»rr'aciied  in  the  evening  to  a  large  and  attentive  congregatit)n. 
( )n  the  Sunday  evening  following,  the  School-house  being  too 
small,  the  congregation  were  obliged  to  meet  in  a  barn.  They 
seemed  to  be  principally  Church  people.  Eight  children  were 
baptized,  and  twelve  i)ersons  received  the  Holy  Communion. 
In  the  evening  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  in  the  School.  The 
jjcople  in  this  neighbourhood  evince  considerable  attachment  to 
the  Ej)iscopal  Church,  and  express  much  solicitude  for  her  regu- 
lar ministrations. 

On  Sunday  the  16th,  I  officiated  to  a  numerous  and  attentive 
congregation  at  Newmarket ;  two  children  were  baptized.  On 
the  Tuesday  following,  I  read  prayers  .ind  preached  in  the  same 
place  to  a  respectable  assemblage  of  people,  and  administered 
the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  to  twelve  persons.  On  the 
evening  of  the  same  day  I  continued  my  journey  to  the  township 
of  West  Gwillimbury,  and  proceeded  the  next  evening  to  Te- 
cumseth,  and  visited  some  of  the  members  of  the  Church  in  that 
township.  I  read  prayers  and  preached  in  the  same  neighbour- 
liood,  on  the  Friday  evening  following,  to  about  forty  of  the 
iidial)itants. 

Having  returned  to  West  Gwillimbury,  1  performed  Divine 
Service  and  preached  there  on  Sunday  the  23rd  February  ; 
though  the  weather  was  cold  and  disagreeable  about  a  hundred 
people  were  present,  and  the  place  in  which  they  assembled  was 
a  barn.  After  baptizing  a  child  on  the  following  morning,  I 
j)assed  on  to  Innisfil,  and  officiated  in  that  township  on  Tuesday 
the  25th  February  ;  about  fifty  people  were  present,  and  two 
children  were  baptized. 

Having  I'eached  Cokhvater,  I  was  rather  disappointed  on 
finding  th.at  comparatively  few  of  the  Indians  were  at  home  ; 
some  of  them  having  gone  to  the  woods  to  hunt,  and  others  to

make  HU^nir.  Tlie  next  inorniii&lt;;  after  my  urrivul  at  Cuptain 
Anderson's,  1  saw  two  heuthon  Indians  from  li  iko  Huron,  but 
had  not  mucli  conversation  with  them,  as  they  were  in  a  state  of 
intoxication.  They  promised  to  meet  me  in  two  days  after  at 
Captain  Andei'son's,  and  th(;y  fulfilled  tlieir  promise.  I  found 
them  extremely  ij^norant  of  reli&lt;};ious  things  ;  tliey  seemed  to 
have  little  or  no  knowled«,''e  of  the  evil  of  sin,  and  to  entertain 
exceedin^dy  va^^ue  and  confined  notions  of  a  future  state  of 
existence  ;  I  invited  them  to  return  from  the  shores  of  Lake 
Huron  at  Kaster,  and  to  brin^  some  of  their  brethren,  that  J 
mi^dit  iiave  an  o])portunity  of  addressin&lt;^  them  on  the  subject  of 
ndifrion.  They  replied  that  they  would  do  as  1  directed  them. 
IJefore  they  left  Coldwater  they  observed  to  some  of  the  Indians, 
that  what  I  had  told  them  entei-ed  tlieir  ears  more  smoothly 
than  any  tliinj^  they  had  ever  heard  l)efore. 

JOURNAL  FOR  AL\l{(If,  Ui'M. 

On  Sunday  the  2nd  March,  1  otKciatetl  in  tli.'  Indians' 
School-house,  but  as  the  inhabitants  in  the  neii«hl&gt;ourhood  of 
Coldwater  are  not  numerous,  the  coni&gt;rei,Mtiou  was  small.  On 
the  evenini^  of  the  same  day,  I  i)reat;hed  to  the  Indians,  wh(» 
were  very  attentive.  On  the  followin;r  Tuesday,  the  Indians 
havini^  met  to;,''ethei',  I  endeavoured  to  j)ersuade  them  to  send 
their  children  rei^ularly  to  school.  In  the  evening,''  I  addressed 
them  on  the  subject  of  religion,  and  some  of  the  Roman  Catholic 
Indians  were  present.  On  Sunday  the  Dth  March,  I  proacheil 
to  the  Indians  at  the  village  of  the  Narrows,  whicli  is  about 
fourteen  miles  from  Coldwater  ;  upwards  of  a  hundred  assem- 
bled, and  thoy  a])peared  to  be  very  devout  and  attentive.  I  also 
read  prayers  and  preached  twice  on  the  same  day  to  the  Settlers 
who  reside  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Narrows  ;  and  thoxigh  the 
weather  was  very  unfavourable,  the  congregation  was  con- 
siderable. 

Having  proceeded  to  Oro,  I  read  piayers  and  preached  at 
the  house  of  jMr.  Rutherford,  near  the  town  line  between  Oro 
and  Orillia  ;  but  the  congregation  was  comparatively  small,  as 
general  notice  had  not  been  given  to  the  inhabitants. 

Having  arrived  at  Penetanguishine  from  Coldwater  on 
Saturday  last,  I  ofiHciatad  twice  on  Sunday  the  Kith,  in  a  room 
in  the  liarracks  ;  about  a  hundred  persons  were  present,  and  a 
child  was  bciptized.  I  purpose  to  remain  here  about  a  week,  and 
then  to  return  to  Coldwater.  The  people  here  are  beginning  to 
express  much  solicitude  for  the  regular  ministrations  of  the 
Church,  and  are  about  to  apply  for  a  resident  Clergyman. 

On  Wednesday  the  l!)th,  having  visited  some  of  the  Pro- 
testant inhabitants  of  tlie  village  near  Penetanguishine,  I  read 
]&gt;rayers  and  preached  to  about  twenty  persons,  and  baptized  a 
child.  On  the  Friday  following,  I  crossed  th^'  harbour  on  the 
ice,  and  visited  Mr.  Rawson,  of  whom  I  made  mention  in  some 
of  my  former  communications  to  you  ;  and  the  next  day  I 
administered  the  Holy  Communion  to  him  and  three  other 
})ersons. 

On  Sunday  the  23rd,  I  officiated  twice  at  the  military  esta- 
blishment ;  the  congregation  was  numerous  and  attentive,  and

The  next  inoriiin*,'  after  Ijaptisinif  a  chih!,  I  left  lVuetani»'uisliine 
and  returned  to  the  township  of  Flos.  Most  of  tiie  snow  iuiviuf 
disapijoared  and  the  road  being  bad,  travelling  was  vi'ry  disa;4ie('- 
able.  On  Tuesday  the  25th,  1  read  prayers  and  lectured  on  tho 
lini'  betwen  Flos  and  Medonte.  The  congregation  was  consider- 
able, tiioiigh  the  weather  was  unfavourable  ;  and  seven  children 
were  baptized.  In  passing  through  the  township  of  Medonte  to 
(^oldwatev,  I  fovmd  a  small  congregation  waiting  for  me  at  the 
house  of  one  of  the  Settlers,  to  whom,  after  having  read  the 
prayers,  I  addressed  a  short  lecture. 

On  the  2{{th,  being  Good  Friday,  I  performed  Divine  Service 
at  Coldwater,  and  preaciied  to  a  small  but  attentive  and  respect- 
able assemblage  of  jjoople.  On  Easter  Day,  I  officiated  at  the 
same  place,and  administered  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper 
to  seven  persons.  In  the  evening,  1  lectured  the  Indians,  but 
only  those  who  are  attached  to  the  Methodists  attended.  On 
the  following  morning,  the  Roman  Catholic  Indians  came  to  me 
in  a  body,  to  state  their  reasons  for  not  sending  their  children 
regularly  to  the  school  ;  but  tlie  objections  and  excuses  they 
advanced  were  of  such  a  frivolous  and  trifling  kind,  that  I  deem 
a  statement  of  them  nnworthy  the  Society's  considerution, 

JOURNAL  FOR  APRIL,  1834. 

On  Friday  the  4th,  I  proceeded  to  the  Narrows  ;  and  the 
next  day,  accompanied  by  Mr,  Atkinson,  I  visited  several  Indian 
families,  who  were  making  sugar  in  the  woods.  Some  of  tiiem 
presented  us  with  small  cakes  of  maple  sugar ;  others  asketl 
(questions  about  farming  ;  and  all  of  them  seemed  attentive  when 
J  spoke  of  religions  things.  On  the  following  Sunday,  1  per- 
fonned  the  morning  service  in  the  school-honse  at  the  Narrows. 
About  a  hundred  peo])le  attended,  the  majority  of  whom  are 
white  settlers?,  in  the  vicinity  of  the  village.  On  that  occasion  I 
administered  the  Holy  Communion  to  ten  persons.  In  the  even- 
ing 1  ])reached  at  the  same  place'  to  the  Indians,  having  been 
previously  recjuested  by  Yellowhead,  their  principal  Chief. 
Having  returned  to  Coldwater,  I  officiated  there  on  Sunday  the 
l.'Jth,  and  a  considerable  number  of  the  Indians  being  i)resent, 
('aj)tain  Anderson  was  kind  enough  to  interpret  a  part  of  my  dis- 
course for  tJieir  instruction. 

Tlie  next  morning  I  left  Coldwater  ;  and  my  horse  having 
met  with  an  accident,  I  was  obliged  to  leave  it  and  proceed  to 
Lake  Simcoe  on  foot.  John  Jones,  a  kind  Indian,  accompanied 
nu",  ;ind  carried  my  portmanteau.  From  the  Narrows,  I  con- 
tinue;! my  journey  in  a  bark  canoe,  with  Mr.  Ilewson,  to  Kem- 
penfeldt  Bay.  The  weather  was  warm  ;  the  ice  had  disajipeared ; 
the  breezes  were  gentle  and  refreshing,  and  the  scenery  along 
the  northern  shore  of  the  lake,  though  rather  monotonous,  was 
very  pleasing  and  entertaining.  Several  of  the  Settlers  near 
the  lake  are  ra})idly  improving  their  farms,  and  their  dwellings 
present  a  very  neat  appearance.  We  stopped  at  the  house  of 
Mr.  M'Vittie,  and  also  called  at  Mr.  Monck's  ;  and  I  baptized  a 
child  at  each  of  these  places.  Before  we  reached  Mr.  O'Brien's 
lesidonce,  the  wind  became  imfavonrable,  and  as  avo  could  not

longer  niana&lt;?o  the  canoo,  I  walked  on  foot  to  Captain  Oliver's  at 
Kenipeufcldt  Bay. 

On  Sunday  the  2()th,  I  officiated  twice  at  Barrie  ;  seven 
persons  recreived  tlie  Sacrament  of  tlie  Lord's  Supjier,  and  one 
child  was  ba[)tized.  The  congre&lt;^ation  amounted  to  about  sixty 
peoi)le,  in  the  morninjj;,  and  to  about  half  that  number  in  the 
eveniuf^.  The  next  mornin/jf,  I  visited  a  youn^jf  man  who  was 
very  ill  of  a  typhus  fever,  who  died  on  the  day  foUowinj^.  I  had 
much  conversation  with  him  on  religious  subjects,  and  his 
answers  to  such  questions  as  he  was  asked  were  satisfactory. 
lie  was  anxious  to  receive  the  Sacrament,  and  seemed  to  under- 
stand its  nature  and  desiijrn.  Three  other  pei-sons,  two  of  whom 
were  youn;,'  men,  received  the  Holy  Communion  with  him.  lie 
afterwards  requested  those  who  were  present  to  sing,  and  desired 
me  to  select  a  suitable  hymn.  On  Wednesday  the  23rd,  J 
officiated  iit  his  funeral,  and  preached  to  a  consideral)le  assem- 
blage of  i)eople,  most  of  whom  were  young  persons.  The  next 
morning  iMr.  llewson  accompanied  me  across  Kempenfeldt  Bay 
in  a  boat,  and  afterwards  I  proceeded  about  eight  miles  on  foot. 
I  found  the  road  very  bad,  but  Mr.  JM'Conkoy  was  good  enough 
to  lend  me  a  horse  till  I  reached  West  Gwillimbury. 

On  Sunday  the  27th,  I  read  prayers  and  preached  in  a  school 
near  the  Penetanguishine  road,  to  a  very  attentive  congregation. 
Two  children  were  baptized.  In  the  evening  I  visited  a  sick 
person,  and  administered  to  her,  and  to  two  others  of  her  family, 
the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Siq)per. 

On  Monday  the  28th,  I  proceeded  to  Yongc-street,  and 
arrived  at  Toronto  on  the  following  day. 


.JOURNAL  FOR  MAY,  1834. 

On  Sunday  the  4th  May,  I  performed  divine  service  at  two 
difterent  places  in  the  township  of  East  Gwillimbuiy,  and  bap- 
tized two  children.  Both  services  were  well  attended.  Having 
reached  the  townshij)  of  North  Gwillimbxiry  on  the  7th,  1  visited 
several  of  the  inhabitants,  accompanied  by  ISIr.  Smalley.  On 
the  Sunday  following,  read  pivayers  and  preached  to  a  numerous 
congregation,  and  explained  a  portion  of  Scripture  to  a  few 
peo])le  in  the  evening.  As  1  travelled  between  North  Gwillim- 
bury and  Georgina,  I  read  prayei-s  and  preached  at  the  house  of 
Mr.  Gager,  to  a  small  but  attentive  assemblage  of  people. 

Having  arrived  at  the  township  of  Georgina,  I  officiated 
there  at  two  dilFerent  places  on  Sunday  the  18th,  to  numerous 
and  attentive  congregations,  and  baptized  four  children.  From 
Georgina  I  continued  my  journey  to  Brock,  and  preached  in 
different  parts  of  the  township.  Nine  children  were  bai)tized. 
On  Sunday  the  25th,  I  read  prayers  and  preached  in  Mr.  R. 
Shier's  barn,  to  about  a  hundred  and  fifty  people,  and  adminis- 
tered the  Holy  Communion  to  fourteen  ])ersons.  Being  desired, 
I  attended  a  meeting  of  Episcopalians  on  the  following  morning, 
who  assembled  to  discuss  the  expediency  of  making  application 
for  a  resident  Clergym.an.  They  express  much  anxiety  for  the 
ministrations  of  the  Church,  but  tliey  want  the  ability,  if  not  also 
the  inclination,  to  contribute  to  the  maintenance  of  a  ^linister.

On  Wednesday  the  20tli,  1  jtroceeded  to  Uxbiidjre,  and  as 
the  Episeoj)alians 'in  that  townsliip  are  yet  eoniparatively  few, 
f  intended  to  eontinue  my  Journey  immediately  to  Whitby  ;  but 
one  of  the  inhabitants  of'  Uxbrid&lt;(C,  Avhom  I  visited,  entreated 
me  to  remain  at  his  house  and  i)reaeh  to  the  peoi)h',—  at  the 
same  time  assuriui;  mo  that  he  would  ^ive  p^eneral  information  to 
tlie  inliabitants.  In  complianee  with  his  wish,  on  the  eveninj^'of 
the  followinj;  day  1  read  prayers,  leetured,  and  baptized  three 
children.  'I'he  people  assembled  in  a  school-liouse  l)elon^rin(r  to 
Mr.  E.  James,  which  stands  on  tlie  side  of  a  gently  rising  liill, 
the  summit  of  which  commands  an  extensive  view  of  tlie  snr- 
roundin"  woods.  I  was  informed  that  several  Quakers  were 
present.  The  subject  of  my  lecture  on  that  occasion  was,  *'  Jle 
that  l)elievoth  and  isbai)tized,  shall  be  saved." 


JOURNAl.  FOR  JUNE,  1«34. 

Having  arrived  in  tlie  townsliip  of  Whitby,  I  performed 
divine  service  and  preached  on  Sunday  the  1st  June,  to  a  far 
more  numei'ous  assemblfige  of  ])eople  than  I  ever  saw  before  in 
this  township.  On  tlie  Tuesday  following,  I  read  i&gt;rayers  and 
preached  to  about  thirty  persons  in  the  township  of  Pickering. 
On  Thursday  the  5th,  I  jierformed  divine  service,  explained  a 
part  of  the  liturgy,  baptized  five  children,  and  preached  to  about 
fifty  people.  The  place  in  which  they  met  was  a  school,  on  the 
eighth  concession  of  Whitby.  Here  the  Episcopalians  requested 
me  to  administer  to  them  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  ; 
and  instead  of  officiating  only  once,  as  I  expected,  I  was  desired 
to  lecture  at  three  difl'eront  places  in  the  neighbourhood.  On 
Sunday  the  fith,  I  again  officiated  in  this  township,  at  a  school- 
house  near  the  Kingston  road,  but  it  was  far  too  small  for  the 
congregation,  which  was  very  numerous.  On  that  occasion  two 
children  were  baptized,  and  fourteen  persons  received  the  Holy 
Communion.  Afterwards  I  rode  about  twelve  miles,  and  offi- 
ciated in  the  school  at  Bowmanville.  Though  notice  had  not 
been  very  generally  circulated,  it  was  supposed  that  about  a 
hundred  people  were  present.  On  the  following  day,  after  visit- 
ing some  of  the  Episcopalians  in  Darlington,  I  returned  to 
Whitby.  On  Wednesday  last,  I  officiated  at  two  different 
places  in  the  rear  of  this  township,  and  administered  the  Sacra- 
ment to  ten  persons. 

On  Sunday  the  15th,  I  read  prayers  and  preached  in  a  barn, 
on  the  rear  of  the  township  of  Whitby,  to  about  a  hundred 
l)eople,  who  were  chiefly  English,  and  baptized  a  child.  On  the 
following  morning,  I  proceeded  to  the  township  of  Tlrock,  and 
lectured  several  times  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Cowan,  from  whom  I 
received  niKch  kindness.  On  Sunday  the,  22nd,  I  performed 
divine  service  in  two  different  places  in  that  township  to  very 
attentive  congregations.  Being  desired,  I  administered  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  to  two  persons,  and  ba])U.red  five 
children.  On  the  following  Tuesday  I  continued  my  journey  to 
(ieorgina,  and  visited  some  of  the  inhabitants.  On  Friday  the 
27tli,  I  read  prayei-s  and  lectured  on  the  sixth  concession  of  that 
township  to  about  thirty  peo])le,and  baptized  three  children.  On 
the  Sunday    following  I  officiated  at  two    different  places  in

JOURNAL  FOR  .JULY,  1834. 

Ilavin^j^  arrived  at  Cohhvater  I  visited  the  Indian  school  (on 
Wedne.s&lt;hiy  the  2d  of  .Jidy,)  which  I  am  happy  to  inform  you  is 
now  much  better  attended  than  it  was  in  winter.  On  the  Sunday 
foUowin;,'  1  preached  to  tlie  Indians  who  were  very  attentive.  In 
the  afternoon  J  visited  the  Sunday  school,  and  between  twenty 
and  thirty  (diihlren  were  in  attendance  ;  I  heard  several  of  them 
read  in  the  New  Testament  and  recite  the  Creed  and  the  Lord's 
I'rayer,  both  in  the  Knf,dish  and  Chii)i)ewa  lanf,Mia;(es. 

The  next  day  I  had  an  interview  with  el(;venChij)pewa  Indians 
who  came  to  visit  Captain  Anderson.  I  addressed  them  on  the 
suDJect  of  relisj^ion,  but  unfortunately  they  are  very  fond  of  drink- 
in&lt;if  si)irituous  licpiors,  which  is  a  j^reat  iiindrance  to  their  conver- 
sion or  civilization  ;  they  were  very  attentive  when  I  spoke  to  them 
of  Sin,  Heaven  and  Hell,  and  Salvation  throiijj;  Jesus  Christ. 

On  Wednesday  the  9th,  1  went  to  the  Narrows  and  read 
prayers,  and  ])re€ached  to  about  sixty  of  the  Settlers  on  the 
Sunday  following ;  bein^  desired,  I  preached  to  the  Indians  in 
the  afternoon,  and  explained  a  portion  of  Scripture  in  the  even- 
injr  to  a  few  ])eo[)le  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Gill. 

On  Tuesday  the  iSth,  I  jiroceeded  from  Coldwater  to  I'ene- 
tanfTuishino  in  a  boat  with  eii^ht  Indians,  some  of  whom  reside 
at  Grape  Island,  and  informed  me  that  they  were  on  a  mission- 
ary tour  to  their  heathen  brethren  ;  I  was  liappy  to  find  that  they 
luive  some  knowled&lt;fe  of  Christianity,— they  repeatedly  asked  me 
tiio  meaniufi;  of  words  and  passa'jes  of  Scripture.  As  the  wind 
happened  to  be  very  xmfavourable,  we  did  not  reach  Penetanj»-ui- 
shine  till  late  in  the  evenin*;;',  but  1  did  not  reL,a'et  t]!is,as  the  con- 
versation of  the  Indians  was  very  interestinsf,  and  abundance  of 
time  was  .afforded  for  contemplating  the  wild  scenery  through 
which  we  passed. 

The  next  day  after  my  arrival  at  Penetanguishine,  I  lec- 
tured toaconsiderablenumberof  Indians,  from  the  shores  of  Lake 
Huron,  on  Christianity  and  Civilization.  A  Roman  Catholic 
Indian  introduced  mo  to  his  Pau^an  l&gt;rethren,  explained  n\v 
o])ject  in  addressing  them,  and  exliorted  tliem  to  give  their  par- 
ticular attention  to  what  I  had  to  say.  A  Protestant  Indian 
from  Coldwater  acted  as  interpreter.  My  addii'ss  being  finished, 
John  Sunday,  a  Christian  from  Grape  Island,  lose,  and  in  a  verv 
handsome  manner  recommended  the  Indians  to  attend  to  my 
instructions  ;  he  commented  on  .almost  eveiy  ])art  of  my  lecture, 
and  told  his  brethren  that  every  thing  which  I  had  said  to  theni 
was  true — I  desired  him  to  conclude  witli  a  short  prayer  in  the 
Chi})pewa  language,  which  he  did,  and  then  as  many  as  were 
able  Joined  in  singing  a  hymn. 

These  religious  exercises  being  ended,  one  of  the  Indians 
rose  and  said  that  he  would  become  civilized  next  year,  and  two 
others  followed  his  example  in  succession  ;  a  fourth  said  that  ho 
was  willing  to  be  instructed,  Imt  that  he  would  embrace  the  old

lolipion  and  not  tho  «&lt;?jr.  Anothor  said  that  he  liad  never  heard 
Huc'li  thinj^H  lu^fore,  and  that  he  had  not  yet  resolved  what  course 
to  pursue.  Thus  they  all  heifan  to  excuse  themselves  ;  hut  I  am 
persiuuled  that  this  would  not  lonjf  he  the  case,  if  the  jj^ood 
tidiuffs  of  salvation  were  repeatedly  preached  to  them.  Man  is 
an  imitative  heinj,',  and  tin?  Indians  are  very  docile.  Were 
Miinisters  of  our  Church,  with  their  hearts  in  the  cause,  sent  to 
reside  amonj^  them,  they  would  (juickly  win  tiieir  affection  and 
jrain  their  confidence.  The  darkness  in  which  they  sit  at  present, 
would  soon  he  dispelled  by  the  lij^ht  of  Christianity. 

On  the  17th  July,  presents  were  issued  to  taree  hundred 
Indians,  all  sittinj^  tojjfether  in  order,  oji  the  fj^rass  near  the  Naval 
Store,  at  Penetan^mishine.  They  were  generally  ill  clad,  but 
seemed  to  he  cheerful,  mild,  and  patient.  They  may  well  1)6 
compared  to  sheep  having  no  shepherd  ;  and  no  Christian  should 
be  envied  for  his  apathy,  who  could  behold  them  unmoved. 

I  next  day  visited  some  of  the  inhabitants,  and  also  had  a 
long  conversation,  with  a  little  group  of  Indians,  on  religious 
subjects. 

On  Sunday  the  20th,  I  officiated  twice  at  the  military  esta- 
blisliment,  and  baptized  four  children.  The  congregation  con- 
sisted ot' about  seventy  pooi)lo.  In  the  morning  I  had  an  oppor- 
tunity of  addressing  a  few  Indians  and  exhorting  them  to  be- 
come Christians. 

On  the  following  Tuesday,  I  visited  Mr.  Rawson,  delivered 
a  short  lecture  to  a  few  persons  who  met  at  his  house,  and  ad- 
ministered the  Holy  Conmiunion  to  him  and  four  others. 

On  the  evening  of  Wednesday  the  23d,  one  of  the  Chiefs  of 
the  Chippewa  Tribes  came  into  the  Indian  Council  House,  which 
was  a  sort  of  large  wigwam,  covered  with  green  branches,  and 
stati'd  to  Captain  Anderson,  that  he  and  about  seventy  others 
were  desirous  of  being  civilized  ;  but  that  they  wished  to  settle 
on  the  IManitoulin  Island,  and  not  at  Coldwater.  I  endeavoured 
to  i)ersuade  him  to  embrace  Christianity,  stating  some  of  the 
principal  truths  of  religion,  and  the  advantages  which  would  at- 
tend their  attachment  to  our  Church.  I  desired  him  to  acquaint 
his  people  with  what  I  had  said,  and  then  to  make  known  to  me 
their  determination. 

A  considerable  number  of  Methodist  Indians  having  arrived 
on  the  following  morning,  Mr.  Peter  Jones  said,  that  should  I  be 
desirous  of  preaching  to  them  and  their  heathen  brethren  to- 
gether, he  would  give  them  general  information.  Having 
informed  him  that  I  should  be  happy  to  address  them,  we  were 
soon  surrounded  by  a  large  assemblage.  They  all  reclined  on 
the  grass  in  silence,  some  in  the  council  house,  and  others  in  the 
open  air  ;  the  Pagans  quietly  smoking  tobacco,  but  the  professors 
of  Christianity  behaving  like  civilized  people.  As  soon  as  they 
had  all  assembled,  Assickenec,  a  clever  Roman  Catholic  Indian, 
stood  up  and  addressed  his  countrymen,  calling  upon  them  all 
to  listen  with  attention  to  what  I  was  about  to  say.  Mr.  P. 
Jones  read  a  hymn  in  Chippewa,  which  the  Indians  sang  ;  then 
I  said  a  short  prayer,  selected  chiefly  from  one  of  the  baptismal 
offices,  and  lectured  on  the  following  words  : — "  Behold  I  bring 
you  good  tidings  of  great  joy,  which  shall  be  to  all  people."    An

Indian  from  Cold  water,  with  whom  I  wns  ncqtiainted,  intor- 
pn^tod.  Though  his  knowledge  of  the  Eniflish  is  Hmall,  h&lt;* 
Moemed  to  understand  mo  oxcoodin^'ly  well,  and  spoke  with 
ftfroat  enerfify  and  fluency.  My  lecture?  l)(»inji  ended,  Mr.  Jones 
rose,  and  in  a  very  graceful  and  ])loaHinp;  manner  addressed  the 
Indians  in  their  own  lan«fuaj;e,  and  concluded  with  a  brief 
extempore  j)rayer  ;  after  which  a  hymn  was  sunp. 

On  the  day  followin/;,  such  of  tiie  lu^athen  Indians  as  were 
disposed  to  accept  the  offer  of  civilization,  came  to  acquaint  me 
with  their  intention  in  rep^ard  to  religion.  1  was  apprehensive 
that  they  would  excuse  themselves,  by  saying  that  they  should 
prefer  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  as  some  of  them  had  told 
me  privately  that  tlu'v  wished  to  embrace  what  they  called  the 
French  Reli{i;ion.  After  they  had  reclined  in  silence  a  consider- 
able time,  an  Indian  rose,  .and  a  pi])e  bein^r  lighted,  we  were  all 
requested  to  smoke  with  him.  Then  he  shook  hands  with  us  ; 
made  a  short  speech  ;  promised  to  become  a  Cliristian,  and 
attach  himself  and  all  his  family  to  the  English  Church.  Three 
other  Indians  followed  his  example.  Then  the  Chief  of  a  Tribe, 
consistinpf  of  about  seventy-five  persons,  said  that  thev  avouKI 
return  next  sprin^j  and  settle  on  the  Manitoulin  Island,  but  that 
they  would  not  pledj^e  themselves  at  pi'esent  to  become  mem- 
bers of  the  Church.  He  assured  me,  however,  that  in  the 
meantime  I  need  have  no  apprehension  that  they  would  follow 
any  other  denomination — that  he  thouj];ht  relij^ion  a  good  thing, 
and  that  he  would  go  witli  me  next  summer  to  see  his  Great 
I^'ather  at  Toronto,  and  converse  with  him  about  Christianity. 
I  approved  of  this,  and  endeavoured  to  encourage  them,  exhort- 
ing them  to  pray,  and  to  think  of  what  I  had  preached  to  them. 
Then  the  Chief,  with  a  smile  on  his  countenance,  which  was 
remarkably  expressive,  said  that  as  some  of  his  people  had  left 
their  children — some  their  wives,  and  others  their  parents — in 
the  forests,  he  was  persuaded  that  we  could  not  think  hard  of 
them  for  returning  to  take  care  of  tliem.  Tliey  all  shook  hands 
with  me  before  they  repaired  to  their  canoes  ;  and  as  they  had 
sometimes  seen  me  give  little  things  to  the  Indians,  they  re- 
minded me  that  they  thought  their  Great  Father's  Minister 
might  give  them  some  bread  for  their  children  to  eat.  I  found 
no  difficulty  in  complying  with  their  desire,  as  we  happened  to 
be  near  the  baker's. 

On  the  same  day  I  rode  about  eight  miles  down  the  Pene- 
tanguishine  road,  and  read  prayers  and  preached  loa  few  peojde 
at  the  house  of  a  person  who  was  very  sick,  and  in  a  lamentable 
situation,  as  regards  his  spiritual  concerns.  Two  children  were 
baptized. 

On  Sunday  the  27th,  I  performed  divine  service  twice  at 
the  militaiy  establishment ;  baptized  a  child,  and  administered 
the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  to  twelve  persons. 

On  the  following  morning,  I  proceeded  to  (!!oldwater,  but 
returned  to  Penetanguishine  the  next  day,  as  1  was  informed 
that  a  favourable  opportimity  would  be  presented  of  preaching 
to  certain  Chippewa  Tribes,  who  had  lately  arrived.  On  the 
last  two  days  of  July,  I  preached  to  a  large  assemblage  of 
Roman  Catholic  Ottawas,  and  Pagan  Chippewas,  who  were  very

attentive  ;  and  Assickenec,  whom  I  liavo  alrcad/  mentioned,  was 
kind  enouj?U  to  interpret.     I  e.\|)eeted  the  Cliippewas  to  come  for- 
ward and  j)ublicly  avow  their  intention  of  attaehinjj  themselv"s 
to  the  Church  ;  Imt  Ainee,  their  principal  Chief,  declined  do»  n^ 
this,   in   the   presence   of  hi.s    Roman   Catholic   bi-ethren,    ^nd 
recpiested  me  to  pay  them  a  visit  in  the  evening,  at  their  wig- 
wams.   Accordingly,  a  little  l)efore  night,  a  large  canoe  was  sent 
to  convey  me  across  the  liurbour,  their  wigwams  ])eing  erected 
on  its  western  shore  :  Captain  Anderson  and  two  Indians  from 
(joldwater  were  good  enough  to  accompany  me.     Having  arrived 
at  the  residence  of  Aince,  we  found  that  his  wigwam  was  a  very 
neat  one,  and  were  invited  to  sit  down  on  mats,  with  which  the 
whole  floor  was  covered,  except  a  small  space  in  the  middle, 
which  was  assigneil  to  the  fire.     The  place  was  soon  filled  with 
the  sons,  relations,  and  connections  of  the  Chief,  who,  being  all 
seated  in  order  on  the  floor,  all  were  silent  for  a  few  minutes. 
Then  Aince,  a  fine,  tall  nmn,  and  apparently  of  the  mixed  breed, 
rose  and  nuide  a  speech,  informing  me  that  he  had  long  thouj'ht 
of  civilization,  and  that  for  ^ome  years  j)ast  Chnstianity  had 
been  to  him  a   matter  of  serious  consideration  ;  that  different 
denominations  of  Christians  had  solicited   him  and  his  people  to 
join  them,  but  that  lie  had  repeatedly  declined  attaching  himself 
to  any  of  them  ;    that  he  was  now  convinced  of  the  excellence 
of  the  Christian  Religion  ;  and  that  since  his  own  (Jreat  Father 
at  Toronto  had  at  length  sent  a  minister  of  his  religion  to  teach 
him  and  his  jjcople,  they  received  the  offer  with  joy  and  glad- 
ness :  that  they  wished  to  live  on  the  Manitoulin  Island,  and  to 
have  me  to  teach  them  and  their  children.     I   assured  them 
that  all  they  had  said  had  given  me  great  satisfaction  ;  that  I 
lioped  their  Great  Father  would  send  them  teachers  of  his  own 
religion,  and  that  I  would  willingly  and  gladly  instruct  them, 
if  it  should  i)lease  the  Fathers  of  the  Church  to  send  me.     Then 
1  explaintHl  to  them  some  things  connected  with  religion,  and 
added  a  short  exhortation.     One  of  the  two  Indians  from  Cold- 
water,  being  desired,  offered  uj)  a  prayer  in  a  very  solemn  and 
agreeable  tone  of  voice,  and  in  their  own  language,  which  being 
ended  they  sang  a  hymn.     On  the  following  morning,  another 
Indian  family,  consisting  of  eight  persons,  expressed  their  desire 
to  become  members  of  the  Church,  and  to  settle  with  Aince  and 
his  people,  on  the  Manitoulin  Island. 


JOURNAL  FOR  AUGUST,  1834. 

On  the  1st  of  Augutit  I  returned  from  Penetanguishine  to 
Coldwater,  being  informed  that  probably  no  more  opportimities 
would,  at  that  time,  be  presented,  of  preaching  to  the  Indians. 
The  next  day  I  proceeded  to  the  village  at  the  Narrows  ;  and  on 
Sunday  the  '.k\,  read  prayers  and  ])reaclied  there,  at  the  house  of 
Mr.  Atkinson,  to  about  tliirty  people.  In  the  evening  I  officiated 
at  the  house  of  Dr.  Algeo,  in  the  township  of  Oro,  and  about  forty 
})ersons  were  present.  On  the  following  day  I  returned  to  Cold- 
water. 

On  the  7tl  of  August,  I  left  Coldwater  and  again  proceeded 
to  the  Narrows,  and  from  thence  the  next  day  to  North  Gwiliim- 
buiy  by  the  steam  boat,    lieiug  particularly  requested  to  ofticiate

hundred  jeople,  and  baptized  two  children.  On  the  six  followini; 
days  1  visited  almost  every  part  of  the  township,  and  read  prayer^ 
and  lectured  every  day  at  four  o'clock  in  the  afte;  Moon  :  I  was 
much  i)leased  with  the  kindness  of  the  people  and  tluiir  atteiul- 
ance  at  divine  service.  Several  children  were  I&gt;aptized  durinj:

On  Monday  the  1st,  having  visited  son»o  sick  persons  in  the 
township  of  West  Gwillimbury,  1  j)roceeded  to  Tecumsetii,  an 
adjoining  township.  On  the  evening  of  the  following  Wedne&gt;-

concession  of  Tecumseth,  near  the  i)lace  where  the  new  Cluiich 
has  been  lately  erected.  Though  general  previous  notice  had 
not  been  given,  about  forty  jieople  were  present.  The  next  day 
I  read  prayers  and  i)reached  to  about  thirty  persons,  at  the 
residence  of  Mr.  Mairs,  on  the  ninth  concession  of  the  ianu*

In  proci'odinj;,  on  I'riday  thoAtIt,  to  Innisfil,  which  jidjoins 
Wfht  (iwillimlmrv  on  tlio  north  side,  I  cnt.sscd  a  cunscway  iihout

to  iihdiit  ninety  persons,  and  hjipti/ed  twcdve  chihlren.  Oti  the 
evening'  of  the  same  (hiy  I  u^rn'ui  lectur(&gt;d  at  another  pho  e  in  the 
Hunu'  ni'i^dihourhood  ;  twenty  persons  attench'd,  and  one  cliihl 
was  hapti/ed.  As  1  n'tnrned  to  'reciinisetli  the  next  thiy,  I 
found  a  &lt;on«irej,'ation  of  ahout  thirty  persons,  ex  poet  injf  nie,  at  a 
scliocd  near  th»&gt;  line  hetweeii  that  townsliip  and  West  (iwiliiin

preached  twice,  in  a  barn  hehmj^Mn;,' to  Mr.  Richardson  :  it  was 
siipjjosed  that  ahoiit  two  hmnlred  and  fifty  peojde  attended  in

pra  I'fs,  and  h'ctured  on  tiie  lituj'|,'y,  pri'aclied  to  altout  forty 
people,  and  l)apti/e&lt;l  two  ciiihlren.  i f  tlu?  weather  had  not  heen 
very  unfavourahle  on  that  occasion,  it  is  supposed  that  tlie  &lt;'on- 
j;rejfation  would  have  l)een  much  nn»re  nnim&gt;rous.  Having  re- 
turned to  'I'ecuniseth,  on  'I'uesday  tlui  !)th,  1  read  prayers,  ex- 
plained som,'  parts  of  tlie  litur^^y,  and  preaclu'd  to  ahout  thirty 
very  attentive!  peoph&gt;,  at  Mr.  White's,  on  tl^)  third  concession. 
'I'lie  next  day  1  paid  another  visit  to  the  inhabitants  of  Ivssa  and 
Innisfil.  I  orticuited  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Peri'v,  and  explaine&lt;l  a 
portion  of  the  Cliui-ch  service,  and  ])reached  to  a  vi'ry  attentive 
assend&gt;lut,'e  of  peojde.  On  tluit  occasion  the  ci,n;.;re&lt;^ation  (con- 
sisted of  about  sexi-nty  ])eoph) ;  and  one  &lt;luld  was  baptized. 
The  Settlers  in  that  nei&lt;;hbourhood  are  of  different  persuasions, 
are  exceedin&lt;,My  attentive,  and  have  repeatedly  solicited  me  to 
visit  them  more  frequently. 

In  returninj,^  to  Tecumseth  on  the  following;  mornin|.',  I  liad 
occasion  to  call  at  two  honse.s  near  tlie  road,  but  at  a  considerable 
distance  from  each  other.  At  each  of  those  places  I  was  re- 
tjuefited  to  j)ray  with  the  family,  and  thus  unexj)ected  opjtortuni- 
ties  were  i)resentod  for  nnitual  edification  and  prayer;  these 
poor  people  received  me  with  joy,  but  expressed  their  deep  rejjret 
that  so  many  members  of  the  Established  ('hurch  must  either 
live  destitute  of  the  public  ministrations  of  Kelii,'ion,  or  walk  in 
ways  unknown  to  their  ancestors.  On  the  oveniny;  of  the  same 
day  I  read  jirayers  and  lectured  at  the  house  of  Mr.  James 
Armstron&lt;&gt;' :  on  that  occasion  about  twenty  jjorsons  were  present. 

On  Friday  the  12th,  I  proceeded  to  the  eif^htli  concession : 
ba[)tized  five  children  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Kamsey  ;  and  read 
prayers,  explained  a  portion  of  the  liturfry,  and  i)reached  at  Mr. 
lianimiU's  to  twenty  persons.  The  next  day  havinj^  baptized 
two  children,  and  proceeded  to  the  house  of  JSFr.  Davis,  which  is 
in  the  west  ])art  of  Tecumseth,  I  read  prayers,  lectured  tin  the 
Church  service,  and  preached  to  about  fifty  peoj)le.  On  that 
occasion  three  children  were  baptized. 

On  Sunday  the  14tli,  I  officiated  twice  at  Mr.  Richardson's, 
and  administered  the  Holy  Communion  to  seventeen  persons. 
It  was  supposed  that  about  three  hundred  people  attended  the

J  laving  arrived  in  the  townsliipof  Albion,  on  Sunday  the 
2ist,  I  jterfornuid  divine  service,  lectured  on  the  litur;,'y,  and 
preached  to  a  numerous  and  att(!ntiv(!  assenibla&lt;'(t  of  the  inhahi- 
ttuits,  who  met  in  a  barn  at  lloulton's  mill.  About  a  hundr(&gt;d 
and  fifty  persons,  who,  I  am  informed,  were  cliieHy  Kpiscopalians, 
were  present,  and  seven  children  were  baptized.  1  was  ai&lt;n'rably 
surpnse&lt;l  on  findinj^  so  many  membersof  the  Church  in  that  part 
of  the  township  ;  because,  on  a  former  oc(rasion,  1  was  in  some 
measure  discoura^»'d  by  the  inisreprestMitations  of  one  of  the 
earliest  Settlers  in  the  neifj;hbourhood,  and  a  professor  of  superior 
piety.  On  the  following Sicmday  and  Tuesday  1  othciated  in  the 
same  township,  and  baptized  five  children. 

From  Albion  I  proceeded  to  Mono  ;  and  on  Saturday  the 
27th,  I  read  prayers,  lectured  on  the  litur{j;y,  preached  to  about 
forty  people,  and  baptized  seven  children. 

On  Sunday  the  2Uth,  tho  weather  was  nnfavonrable,  and  the 
new  Church  beinij;  still  far  from  bein^'  finished,  the  people  were 
oblifred  to  assemble  in  a  barn.  Thouf&gt;;h  it  was  very  cold  and 
disajfroeablo,  about  two  hundred  people  attended,  and  many  of 
them  liad  walked  a  lonj^  distance  on  toot  from  their  lodj,'es  in  the 
wilderness.  Jlavinfj  read  prayers,  lectured  on  a  i)art  of  the 
morning  service,  and  preached,  I  administered  the  Sacrament  of 
the  Lord's  Suinior  to  seven  persons,  and  baptized  twenty  children. 
I  also  baptized  two  children  early  in  the  morning,  whose  parents 
informed  me  that  they  had  come  a  great  distance  and  could  not 
conveniently  attend  divine  service,  as  they  wished  to  return 
home  immediately  to  the  rest  of  their  family.  The  next  day  I 
visited  a  sick  person  in  that  neif^hbourhood,  who  is  a  member  of 
the  Church,  and  a  widow.  At  her  house  I  found  a  congregation 
of  about  thirty  people  ;  and  after  reading  prayers  and  lecturinj;, 
T  administered  the  lloly  Communion  to  her  and  ten  other  persons, 
some  of  whom  were  her  own  children.  On  that  occasion  one 
child  was  baptized. 

On  Tuesday  the  last  day  of  September,  I  rode  about  twelve 
miles  in  a  northern  direction,  to  the  township  of  Mulmur,  and 
read  prayers,  preached,  lectured  on  the  liturgy,  and  baptized 
seven  children.  Though  the  inhabitants  of  this  township  are  yet 
comparatively  few  ;  and  though  my  intention  to  visit  them  had 
not  been  made  generally  known  in  the  neighbourhood,  about 
thirty  persons  attended.     At  present,  travelling  is  difficult  in

On  Wednesday  the  1st,  1  returned  from  Mulniur  to  Alhion, 
and  in  passing'  tlirou^di  the  township  of  Mono.  1  hnnti/ed  a  child 
for  one  of  the  Settlers.  The  next  day  I  read  prayers  and 
preached  to  hetween  tw&lt;'nty  and  thirty  people,  at  th(&gt;  house  of 
Mr.  Uiihardson,  in  the  township  of  Alhion.  On  Friday  the  lird, 
I  [iroceeded  to  Mr.  Wilson's,  perrornu'*!  the  evening'  service, 
explaiiu'd  a  portion  (»f  tlu'  liitur^'y,  preached  to  ahout  twenty 
people,  and  hapti/.ed  two  children.  In  the  evening  I  visited  two 
faiuilii's  helonufinj^  to  the  Church,  who  were  ill  of  a  fever. 
Ilavin^r  reached  Houlton's  mill,  in  a  central  part  of  the  township, 
the  people  heint;  assemhled  in  u  barn,  1  n-ad  prayers,  explained 
a  part  of  the  Church  s(M-vice,  iircached,  administcsred  the  Sacra- 
uient  of  the  Lord's  Supper  to  thirty  an&lt;l  that  of  baptism  to  eif,dit 
persons.  It  was  supposed  that  the  con^'rej^ation  amounted  to 
ahout  two  hundred  and  lifty  people,  a  lar|,'e  nuijority  of  whom 
are  said  to  h(&gt;  Episcopalians.  The  next  nu)rnin^  I  visited  a  sick 
pnrsou,  at  whose  house  1  explained  u  portion  of  Scripture  to  a 
few  memners  of  the  Church. 

On  Tuesday  the  7th,  I  in-oceeded  to  Chinf^funcousy,  and  re- 
lumed on  the  Hth  to  tids  city.  On  the  Sunday  following  I  read 
prayers,  lectured  on  the  Liturgy,  i)reaehed  to  about  one  hundred 
people,  and  baptized  four  children.  In  the  evening  I  officiated 
iu  another  |»art  of  the  same  townshij),  and  about  fifty  personH 
were  present.  On  the  evenings  of  Tuesday  the  I4th  and  Thurs- 
day the  Kith,  I  performed  divine  service,  and  preached  in  two 
different  places  in  the  same  neighbourhood,  to  very  attentive 
congregations.  Having  arrived  in  Albion,  I  officiated  near  the 
south  west  corner  of  that  township  on  Sunday  the  I9th,  and 
though  the  weather  was  rather  unfavourable  about  a  luindred 
attended,  and  five  children  were  ba})tized.  'J'he  next  day  I 
again  road  i)rayers  and  preached  in  the  same  neighbourhood,  to 
a  considerable  congregation,  and  baptized  six  children.  On 
the  Thursday  following  I  again  i)erformed  divine  service,  and 
preached  near  the  line  between  the  townships  of  Chinguacouay 
and  Albion  ;  about  twenty  persons  were  present,  and  one  child 
wa.s  baptized. 

On  Friday  the  24th,  I  proceeded  to  Caledon,  and  officiated 
on  the  two  following  days  in  that  township  ;  on  both  occasions  I 
read  prayers,  made  observations  on  the  service  of  the  Church, 
and  preaclied.  Though  the  weather  was  extremely  unfavour- 
able at  that  time,  divine  service  was  well  attended.  Three 
children  were  baptized,  and  on  Sunday  fourteen  per-sons  re- 
ceived the  Holy  Communion.  On  my  return  to  Chinguacousy, 
on  Tuesday  the  28th,  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  at  a  house  oii

the  fifth  conoefesion  of  that  township.  Tho  next  day  1  officiated 
at  a  school-house  near  llurontaiio-street,  in  the  township  of 
'J'oronto,  but  as  notice  had  not  been  {ronerallv  ^ivon  to  tlie  inlia- 
bitants,  only  about  twenty  persons  were  present. 

The  :iOth,  being  appointed  as  a  day  of  timnksgiving,  I  offi- 
ciated in  the  morning  at  llurontario  Church,  and  in  tho  evening 
at  a  school  in  another  part  of  the  township  ;  the  congregations 
would  have  been  much  more  numerous  if  general  information 
had  been  circulated  among  the  inhabitants.

Instead  of  making  any  observations  of  their  own  on  the 
above  Table  and  Journal,  the  Committee  are  j)leased  to  be  ablo 
to  submit  the  following  excellent  remarks  of  the  Journalist 
himself : — 

Turonto,  VMh  Xumuhcr,  1834. 

Reverend  Sir, — Though  I  have  already  communicated  to 
you,  for  the  information  of  the  Society,  a  concise  statement  of 
my  missionary  excursions  and  labours,  I  deem  it  my  duty,  on 
this  occasion,  to  transmit  a  few  additional  observations  lespect- 
ing  the  si)here  of  my  exertions. 

The  destitution  of  my  Christian  brethren,  whom  I  have  the 
pleasure  to  serve,  and  their  continual  solicitations  for  tlie  stated 
services  of  the  Church,  urge  me  to  make  an  a])peal  in  their 
behalf,  to  those  who,  1  am  persuaded,  have  their  best  interests 
at  heart,  and  consider  the  extension  and  edification  of  the  Church 
k.s  things  of  the  highest  importance.  I  have  the  satisfaction  to 
inform  you,  that  there  are  members  of  the  Church  in  every 
neighbourhood  which  1  have  visited,  and  that  in  making  my  last 
tour  I  have  been  received  with  increased  attention  and  kindness 
alike  by  them  and  people  of  all  })arties  and  persuasions  which 
this  part  of  the  province  presents.  But  the  adherents  of  the 
Church  have  uniformly  expressed  to  me  their  regret,  that  how- 
ever much  might  be  expected  from  lier,  comparatively  few  are 
favoured  in  this  country  with  her  ministrations.  Though  manv 
of  the  inhabitants  of  this  district  have  been  long  deprived  of  tho

privilege  of  attending  the  service  of  the  Church,  they  cease  not 
religiously  to  retain  their  ancient  attachment  to  her  doctrineM, 
{•onstitution,  and  form  of  worship.     A  vast  number  of  Ejjisco- 
jtalians  are  now  looking  witii  deep  anxiety  to  the  heads  of  the 
Church,  ardently  hoping  that  Clergymen  will   shortly  be  sta- 
tioned in  their  respective  neighbourhoods.     It  is  to  be  regretted, 
that  nuiny  persons  who  originally  belonged  to  our  communion 
have  joined  other  persuasions,  on  account  of  their  destitution  of 
the  public  means  of  grace.     Several  persons  induced  by  their 
views  of  the   Sacrament   of  Iiai&gt;tism*   to  have  their   children 
baptized,  though  not  by  a  Clergyman  of  our  communion,  have 
laineuted  that  no  opportunity  was  presented  for  their  initiation 
into  the  Englisli  Church.     So  ardent  is  the  avidity  with  which 
the  Fij)isc()paliaus  avail  themselves  of  attending   the  occasional 
ministrations  of  the  Church,  that  it  not  uufreipiently  happens 
on  such  occasions,  that  children  are  presented  to  be  baptized 
who  have   been    carried   by  their   parents,  walking  on  foot,  a 
distance  of  ten  or  twelve  miles.     1  am  persuaded  tliat  it  would 
be  easy  at  present,  for  Clergymen  adecpiate  to  the  undertaking, 
to  organize  a  congregation  in  every   ;'ghbourhood  of  the  Home 
District.     But  it  is  to  be  apprehended  that  this  will  not  long  be 
the  case  if  the  number  of  our  Missionaries  be  not  speedily  aug- 
mented.    The  present  generation  of  Episcopalians  having  passed 
away,  their  ])osterity  cannot  be  expected  to  inherit  their  attach- 
ment to  the  Church,  if  they  be  suffered  to  grow  up  uninstructed 
in   her  ])rincij)les,  and   umictiuainted  with  her  form  of  worship. 
Notwithstanding    all    that    has   been   alleged    concerning    the 
nunu'rical  weakness  of  the  Church  in  this  country,  so  far  as  I  am 
ac(|uainted,  tlie  number  of  her  adherents  is  greater  than  that  of 
any  other  denomination  in   this   district.     Their  destitution  of 
the  regular  ministrations  of  religion,  and  danger  of  falling  into 
error,  loudly  call  for  the  instruction,  the  presence  and  protection 
of  their  si)iritual  guides.     It  is  mucli  to  be  wished,  that  a  Clergy- 
nuin  could    be  stationed   in   every  neighbourhood   where    his 
services  are  required.     But   if  tliis  cannot  be  speedily  effected, 
the  want   of  resident  ministers  might  in  a  great  measure  be 
supplied  by  travelling  Missionaries.     If  each  of  our  congrega- 
tions could  be  visited  regularly  by  a  Clergyman,  once  in  every 
two  or  three  weeks,  it  is  hopcl  that  with  the  Divine  blessing 
a(!Coni})iuiying  his  exertions,  the  members  of  the  Church  Avould 
not  only   be  pi-evented  from  separating  from  our  communion, 
but  also  be  induced  diligently  to  attend  to  the  things  which 
hclong  to  their  everlasting  peace.     It  must  be  .admitted,  how- 
ever, tliat  the    disadvantages  and  difliculties,  if  not   dangers, 
attending  the  office  of  a  travelling  Missionary  in  this  country,^ 
are  many,  and  it  nuiy  be  aj)preliended  that  probably  few  Clergy- 
men would  be  disi)osed  to  move  in  a  sphere  of  so  much  exertion 
and  self-denial ;  but  when  we  reflect  how  many  of  our  brethren 
have  been  constrained  by  the   "  the  love  of  Christ"  to  go  with 
messages  of  mercy  to  the  Heathen  in  Eastern  climes  abounding 
with  difficulties,  dangers,  and  dojiths,  it  is  not  to  be  doubted  but 
others,  moved  by  the  same  Divine  principle,  will  emulate  their 

*  I  have  frequently  been  rerjuested  to  re-baptize  such  children,  but  have 
always  declined  eouiplying  w  ith  their  parents'  solicitations.

leoal,  and  gladly  proceed  to  publish  the  f!;ood  tidings  of  salvation 
to  their  own  countrymen  and  Christian  hrothron,  who  aro 
scattered  abroad  in  tliis  Western  worhl.  It  ouf&gt;-ht  to  be  borne 
in  mind  that  though  a  travelliu};  minister  in  this  country  meets 
with  many  causes  of  annoyance,  rejj^ret  and  dissatisfaction, 
arisinpf  from  the  various  characters,  habits,  and  circumstances 
of  the  inhabitants,  yet  he  is  everywhere  received  with  symi)athy 
and  brotherly  kindness,  and  his  work  of  faitli  and  labour  of  love 
are  oftc:i  accompanied  witii  relij^ious  joy,  which  may  be  con- 
sidered as  the  anticipation  of  his  future  reward.  If  a  sufticient 
number  of  miniHtcrs  and  the  means  of  tlieir  maintenance  could 
be  obtained,  a  plan  might  be  adopted  of  supplying  the  various 
congregations  which  aro,  or  might  bo  organized  throughout  tliis 
province,  with  the  stated  services  of  the  Church,  witlu)ut  a 
resident  Clergyman  for  each  tovvnsiiii),  and  yet  it  would  not  be 
necessary  for  the  Missionaries  to  be  continually  travelling. 
Each  of  them  might  have  a  residence  near  the  centre  of  tlio 
circuit  of  his  labours.  My  ac&lt;iuaintance,  however,  with  the 
general  state  of  this  country,  in  regard  to  religion,  is  not  stich  as 
to  enable  me  to  si)eak  ])articularly  respecting  the  number  of 
Clergymen  requisite  for  siu-h  parts  of  the  proviiux'  geJierally,  as 
are  at  present  destitute  of  the  nniiistrations  of  the  C'hurch  ;  but 
if  I  may  be  i)ermitted  to  form  an  opinion  from  what  I  have  seiMi 
in  the  s])here  of  my  labours,  at  least  ten,  o!i  an  average,  aro 
necessary  for  each  district.  Being  acquamied  witli  the  home 
district  generally,  having  re])eatedly  visited  the  dift'erent  neigh- 
bourhoods in  it,  which  aro  without  a  resident  Clergyman,  I  beg 
leave  to  go  a  little  into  detail  respecting  tliis])art  of  the  country. 

There  is  ample  employment  in  the  townships  of  Tecuuisetli 
and  West  (xwillimbury  alone  for  two  or  tliree  Ministers,  but 
one  active  Missionary  would  ])e  of  incalculable  bciu^fit  tu  the 
inhabitants.  The  Settlers  in  West  Gwillimbury  are  numerous, 
and  princi]&gt;ally  Protestants  from  Ireland.  In  that  neighbour- 
hood, I  am  informed,  there  are  about  eighty  families  belonging 
to  tl\e  Church. 

In  August  last,  I  jierformod  divine  service,  and  preached 
daily  for  about  a  week  in  that  townshij).  Tlic  inhabitants  look 
witli  confidence  to  tJio  lu'ads  of  the  Ciuirch  for  a  Clergyman, 
and  have  prepared  nuiterials  for  the  election  of  a  Churcli. 

In  Tecumseth,  the  adjoining  township,  the  Episcopalians 
are  likewise  very  numerous,  and  have  rejjeatedly  expressed 
much  solicitude  for  the  stated  ministrations  of  religion.  The 
daily  service  of  the  Church  v/as  as  well  attended  in  Tecumseth 
as  ill  West  (iwillimbury,  and  on  Sundays  the  congregationis 
were  very  Iarg(!  in  both  townships.  A  Church  has  been  lately 
erected  in  the  townsliip  of  Tecumseth,  in  a  central  situation, 
which,  however,  is  i^iir  from  being  finished. 

There  is  also  a  considerable  congregation  of  people  residing 
in  the  townships  of  Essa  and  Innisfil,  adjacent  to  Tecumseth  and 
West  Gwillimbury,  who  will  very  thankfully  receive  the  visits  of 
the  Clergynuin  who  shall  be  stationed  in  that  part  of  the  country. 

The  towiLships  of  Wliitchurch,  East  Gwillimbury,  and  King 
fonn  an  extensive  field  of  missionary  e.\.ertion  :  the  Clergyman 
juiglit  reside  at  Mowmarket,  where  a  church  has  been  lately

built.  The  conf^e^ation  of  Episcopalians  at  that  villapo  is  con- 
siderable ;  and  in  its  vicinity  the  inhabitants  are  very  much 
divided  on  the  subject  of  relipon. 

It  is  supposed,  that  in  the  township  of  East  (Iwillinibury, 
the  members  of  the  Cliureli  are  comparatively  few,  l)ut  whenever 
I  have  officiated  in  that  neiji^hbonrhood  I  have  met  Avith  a  kind 
reception,  and  numerous  ussembla/^es  of  peo])le  have  att(&gt;nded 
divine  service.  There  is  little  unanimity  amonir  the  inhabitants 
of  tliat  ])art  of  the  country  respecting  religion  ;  and  many  of 
them  have  run  into  the  {j^rossest  errors,  while  others  profess  to 
be  of  no  particular  persuasion. 

The  inhabitants  of  the  township  of  King  are  also  much 
divided  as  respects  their  religious  opinions,  but  the  number  of 
Episcopalians  is  considerable. 

The  town.shij)S  of  IJrock,  Georgina,  Thorah,  and  North 
Gwillimbury  also  present  a  large  sphere  of  missionary  labour. 

The  adiierents  of  the  Church  in  Brock  are  numerous,  and 
liave  long  been  solicitous  for  a  minister.  A  l/hurch  is  much 
wanted  in  that  neighbourhood,  as  the  peojde  are  obliged  to  as- 
semble in  a  barn  for  the  ])ei*formance  of  divine  service. 

The  inhabitants  of  Georgina,  the  adjoining  township,  are 
also  destitute  of  a  Church  ;  tlie  Episcopalians  are  perhaps  the 
most  ntimerous  &lt;lenomination  in  that  neighbourhood,  and  the  rest 
of  thepe()pl&lt;'are])r  nci})ally  l*resbyterians  and  Koman  Catholics. 
The  number  of  Settlers  in  Thorah,  which  is  likewise'  adjacent 
to  Brock,  is  comparatively  small,  atid  thepeophMu  thai  townshi{i 
are  chietiy  Presbyteriiins  and  Churchmen.  The  former  are  said 
to  be  the  most  numerous  denomination. 

N(»rth  Gwillimbury  is  adjacent  to  Georgina  ;   the  inhabi 
tants  of  that  township  are  of  various   persuasions,  hut  would 
"[ladiy  avail  themst-lves  of  the  ])rivileges  of  attending  the  service 
of  the  Cluirch. 

A  Clergyman  is  also  roepiired  for  Whitby  and  Darlington. 
ri;e  Episcopalians  in  both  townshij)s  are  numerous,  and  hav(? 
repeatedly  expressed  tome  their  regret  that  they  should  remain 
so  long  destitute  of  the  stated  services  of  the  Church.  A  Church 
tor  the  people  to  assemble  in  is  wanted  in  both  these  townships. 
'J'lie  Ministe'"  who  may  be  appointed  to  labour  in  Whitby  and 
Dariiujrton  might  also  profitably  extend  his  exertions  to  Reach 
anull  other  adjoining  townships. 

Scarborough,  Pickering,  and  Uxbridge  likevdse  present  an 
*Titeaft*jive  field  of  ministei'iul  exertion.  Much  dixersity  of 
opnoiiMt  prevails  in  these  townships  concerning  religion.  The 
adti*««*'iits  of  the  Church  in  Scarborough  are  numerous  :  a  small 
Chun-K  has  lately  been  eri'cted  on  the  south  side  of  the  town- 
ship, which  is  not  yet  comjdeted,  but  if  it  were  finished,  I  am 
persuaded  that  the  congregation  would  be  large.  The  members 
of  the  Church  residing  in  the  north  part  of  the  same  township 
have  repeatedly  expressed  their  desire  for  a  Clergyman,  and 
congregations  might  easily  be  organized  in  other  i)arts  of  the 
neighbourhood. 

Several  congregations  might  likewise  be  formed  in  Picker- 
ing ;  I  have  sometimes  j)reached  to  numerous  ami  attentive  as- 
semblages of  people  in  that  township.

The  inhabitants  of  Uxbridgo  are  yet  comparatively  few  and 
of  different  persuasions,  but  there  are  adiierents  of  the  Church  in 
tliat  township  as  well  as  in  Pickering;,  and  a  Clergyman  receives 
a  kind  reception  from  the  inhabitants  jjenerally. 

In  Chinpfuacousy,  Albion,  the  nortnern  part  of  the  townshiji 
of  Toronto,  and  the  Gore  of  Toronto,  the  Esj)iscoj)alians  are  ex- 
ceedinfi;ly  numerous,  and  each  of  these;  nelf^hbourhoods  proHciil 
employment  sufficient  for  a  Minister  ;  but  one  active  and  zealous 
Missionary  being  stationed  in  a  central  situation  might  attend 
to  the  various  congregations  which  may  bo  organized  in  tliat 
part  of  the  country. 

The  inhabitants  of  Mono,  Adjala,  Caledon,  and  Mulmur  are 
also  much  in  want  of  the  niinistrations  of  religion.  The  members 
of  the  Church  are  very  numerous  in  the  township  of  Mono,  and 
a  Churcli  has  been  erected,  but  is  far  from  being  completed. 

Perhaps  nearly  one-half  of  tlie  Settlers  in  Adjala,  which  is 
adjacent  to  Mono,  are  Roman  Catholics,  but  the  rest  are  said  to 
be  principally  Protestant  Episcopalians. 

There  is  also  a  large  congregation  of  Episcopalians  in 
Caledon,  which  is  likewise  a  township  adjoining  Mono,  and  a 
Cliurch  for  the  people  to  assemble  in  is  greatly  needed  in  that 
neigbourliood. 

The  Settlers  in  Mulmur  and  Tossorontio,  townships  adjacent 
to  Adjala  and  Mono,  are  yet  comparatively  few,  but  will  be  very 
solicitous  for  the  Missionary,  who  may  be  sent  to  reside  in  that 
part  of  the  district,  to  visit  them  occasionally. 

The  new  settlenumts  on  the  north  side  of  Lake  Simcoe  pre- 
sent a  vast  field  for  the  exertion  of  Missionaries. 

A  resident  Clergyman  is  much  wanted  at  Penetanguishino, 
who  migiit  profitably  extend  his  services  to  the  Settlers  generally, 
in  the  townships  of  Tiny  and  Tay.  As  that  is  the  place  where 
the  Indians  annually  assemble  to  receive  presents  from  the 
Government  if  a  zealous  Minister  were  continually  residing 
there,  he  wo  ''\  gladly  avail  himself  of  the  many  favourable 
opportunities  '  iiich  Avould  be  afforded  of  addressing  them  on 
the  most  important  subjects,  and  thus  he  might  be  intrumental 
in  their  conversion  and  the  extension  of  the  Church. 

Vespra,  Flos,  and  Sunnidale  are  also  destitute  of  the  public 
ministrations  of  religion,  and  present  ample  employment  for  a 
Clergyman. 

The  congregations  at  Barrie  and  Kemponfeldt  are  consider- 
able, and  the  inhabitants  of  that  part  of  the  country  in  general 
are  very  solicitous  for  a  minister.  When  I  last  visited  that 
neighbourhood.  Captain  O'Brien  informed  me  that  he  ])urposcs 
to  have  a  Church  immediately  erected  near  Kempeufeldt  Bay. 

The  Settlers  in  the  township  of  Oro,  Medonte,  and  Orillia 
are  also  numerous,  and  require  a  Clergyman  to  reside  and  labour 
among  them.  They  are  also  in  want  of  Churches  to  assemble  in. 
As  many  of  the  people  live  far  apart,  and  as  the  roads  are  yet 
bad,  that  part  of  the  district  presents  a  field  of  great  exertion  for 
a  Missionary. 

Thus  it  appears  that  ten  or  more  Clergymen  are  necessary 
for  such  parts  of  this  district  alone  as  are  destitute  of  the  stated 
services  of  the  Church  ;  and  I  have  taken  the  liberty  of  record-

averajfc,  for  tlic  diftoront  districts  of  tlio  province. 

IJut  as  tli("  j)0])ulation  is  i-jijtidly  and  continually  increasin&lt;&gt;;, 
and  as  a  very  lar^^'O  j)roi)ortion  of  tiio  cniij^i-ants,  who  conic  from

oTeat(?r  niimlKM' of  ministers  than  I  have  mentioned  will  soon  he 
necessary  for  this  flonrishin*,'  and  niafj;niticent  country. 
I  remain,  Itev.  ISir,  with  sincere  re^^ard, 

Your  obedient  lunnble  servant, 

ADAM  J':LI.I0T. 
To  the  U(!v.  r.  IMathews,  M.A.,  Secretary,  &amp;c. 

WluMJ  communicating  to  the  society  the  jiarticnlars  of  his 
imjiortant  interirourse  with  the  Indians  of  l*enetani,niishiiu^,  Mr. 
J'^lliot  has  tiie  foll&lt;)win&lt;r  remark,  which  the  committee  have  re- 
served from  his  .lournal  to  be  noticed  in  tliis  place  : — ^"  I  am 
juM'suaded"  be  says,  "  that  an  o])])ortunity  is  now  j»resented  to 
the  society  of  bein;'-  instrumental,  by  the  Divine  blessin/^,  in 
pitherin^'  many  of  tlieseunliap])y  but  intei-estin^^  peoi)le  into  that 
Church  which  they  j)refer,  ami  which  is  best  adapted  for  tlKur 
conversion  and  Christian  edification." 

The  committee,  it  will  not  be  doubted,  would  indeed  most 
fjladly  seize  the  o])|»ortunity  thus  prcsenttnl,  and  gladly  become 
instrumental  in  ettectin&lt;f  so  desirable  an  object  ;  but  the  narrow 
resources  of  the  society  alto&lt;&gt;ether  forbid  their  enf^^a^inj,^  in  it 
further  than  they  have  done.  At  the  particular  desire  of  the 
liieuteuant  Governor,  they  authorized  Arr.  I'^Uiot  to  devote  as 
much  time  as  he  could  spare,  without  serious  hindrance  to  his 
other  duties,  to  the  instrm^tion  of  tlie  Indians  a.ssemblin&lt;&gt;-  to  re- 
ceive their  presents,  at  the  \illa&lt;^e  of  Coldwater  ;  and  so  accept- 
ably has  he  fulfilled  his  iiistructions  on  this  point,  that  they  are 
strou^'ly  desirous  of  afFordiny-  him  an  op))t)rtunity  at  least  of 
keepiuf^  an  aj)pointment  whicli  he  made  at  thei)-  eanu'st  solicita- 
tion, to  meet  them  at'i'ain  in  the  ensuinfy  spring,  at  the  Manitor&gt;lhn 
Island,  but  this  is  all  they  can  venture  to  do  at  pr&lt;.-.  »t. 

The  spiritual  charge  of  the  destitute  Settlers  of  the  Home 
district,  in  itself,  recpiires  more  time  and  attention  than  Mr. 
Klliot  has  to  bestow,  and  already  calls  for  a  division  of  labour. 
Jn  the  event,  therefore,  of  the  Indians,  whom  Mr.  Elliot  ad- 
dressed, settling  on  the  Manitoulin  Island, or  elsewhere,ase])arato 
Missionary  woxdd  be  manifestly  necessary  for  their  alequatc  in- 
struction. When  such  an  o])portunity  &gt;;hall  arrive,  the  com- 
mittee ho])e  that,  whatever  may  be  the  case?&lt;o»',  the  funds  of  the 
socictv  will  then  be  in  a  condition  to  meet  it.  It  is  with  a  feeling 
amounting  to  distress  that  tliey  listen  to  the  numerous  demands 
of  the  society,  when  their  ability  to  answer  them  is  so  small — 
that  they  hear  their  ti'avelling  Missionary  dechue  that  ten  ov  motr 
(  i-M-gynien  are  necessary  for  such  parts  of  the  Home  District  as 
are  destitute  of  the  stated  services  of  the  Church,  when  it  is  with 
the  greatest  difliculty  they  can  supply  it  with  one — that  they  find 
the  same  gentleman  record  his  opinion  that  a  like  number  is  re- 
quisite, on  an  average,  for  the  remaining  districts  of  the  province, 
HO  provision  whatever  for  which  has  yet  been  made.*     If,  how- 

*  Mr.  Harpur  was  ordainrd,  .I.inuary,  18.35,  to  travel  the  Home  District, 
a.s  one  of  the  Irociety's  Missionaries.

f'vor,  tlioy  rocoivo  such  representations  witli  jui'm,  tliey  pnblisli 
tlieni  with  hope.  Surely,  they  eonehule,  when  this  is  understood 
at  home,  the  clmrities  of  the  British  Lshjs  will  not  slumber  nor 
sleep.  When  thus  invited,  thus  stimmoned,  to  a  field  so  new,  so 
ample,  and  so  interesting,  they  will  rejj^ard  the  Atlantic  that  rolls 
l)etween  it  and  them  but  a  feeble  and  insufficient  barrier  to  their 
interposition.  The  time  has  been  when  they  have  crossed  a 
wider  and  more  perilous  ocean  on  an  errand  not  more  merciful 
— in  a  cause  not  more  holy — to  the  removal  of  idolatries  not  mon^ 
dark,  and  the  preservation  of  religious  knowledge,  when  not  in 
greater  danger  of  extinction. 

The  committee  will  only  remark,  in  reference  to  those 
letters,  that  it  must  be  evident  to  all  l)y  whom  they  are  perused, 
not  only  that  the  writer  was  every  where  received  with  a  respe&lt;'t 
due  to  the  undertaking,  but  resorted  to   with  an  eagerness 
attesting  the  value    set    npon    his    appointment.      Wliatever 
intelligence    of   the    Mission,    indirect  from   the    Missionary, 
reached   the  committee,  came    invai'iably    accompanied    v/ith 
commendation  and  good  wisiies  to  both.    Ilepeated  ajjplications 
have  been  made  to  the  Lord  liishop  of  Quebec  by  members  of 
tlie   Churdi  included  in  INIr.  Elliot's  rounds,  for  his  more  fre- 
quent  returns  and   longer    contuiuance    among    them   ;    thus 
verifying  that  gentleman's   own   written   declaration,  that  he 
"  knows  of  no  place  where  he  should  not  meet  with  a  cordial 
welcome  on  a  second  visit."     When  the  blessings  connected 
with  his  ajjpearance  are  so  invaluable,  Avell  may  the  welcome  with 
which  it  is  hailed  be  cordial.    Within  a  twelvemonth,  besides 
yreachlmj  to   many  thousand    people,     he   '.as  administered   the 
Sacrament  of  ]ia])tism  to  tico  hundred  and  nuieti^-eU/ht  persons,  and 
during  the  last  six  months,  that  is,  since  his  ordination  to  the 
priesthood,  he  has  disi)ensed  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper 
to  one  hundred  &lt;ind  fifti/-tu'o  persons.     Where  there  is  such  an 
evident  connection  between  the  appearance  of  a  Minister  of  the 
Chui'ch,  and  a  desire  on  the  part  of  the  j)eople  to  avail  them- 
selves  of  liLs  ministrations,  that  Church   must   surely  be  en- 
couraged   greatly  in    multiplying    such    oppoi'tunities  to    the 
extent  of  her  power.     How  much  icork  tens  there  for  the  Church 
of  Euijlnnd  to  do  in  the  Home  District  alone !  and  how  much  of  thit 
work  has  been,  accomplished  by  the  hands  of  a  sinejle  Minister  ?     Hov 
much  work  remains  for  the  same  Church  to  do  in  other  Districts!  and 
how  desirable  does  it  appear  that  it  should  be  accomplished  in  a  similar 
manner  ? 

With  regard  to  the  finances  of  the  Society,  the  committe(&gt; 
cannot  congratidate  the  meeting  npon  any  considerable  addition 
to  the  sul»Hcription  list, — a  circumstance  more  to  be  regretted  at 
a  time  wlien  the  pecuniary  engagements  of  the  Society,  in  tlio 
support  of  two  active  Missions,  have  become  so  gi-eat.  They, 
liowever,  trust  that  a  clear  understanding  of  the  nature  of  those 
engagements  will  remove  any  difficulty  of  t!iis  kind,  and  1»' 
followed  by  an  inci'eased  and  liberal  contribution. 

Certainly  this  is  not  a  moment  for  the  friends  of  the  Society 
to  relax  their  exertions.  Let  every  member  acquaint  himsclt' 
with  its  designs,  aind  the  measures  adopted  to  carry  them  intd 
execution  ;   that,  if  persuaded  in  liis  own  mind  of  the  utility  ot

tho  one,  and  the  prudciico  of  the  other,  lie  may  extend  his  own 
belief  and  conviction  anion&lt;^  his  friends,  li  \s  pritatc  ad roau'ti 
of  this  nutnre  to  which  public  institiitions  are  more  indebted  for 
their  advancement,  than  to  the  celebration  of  anniversaries,  or 
appeals  to  the  public  at  larj^o.  The  last,  indeed,  ou&lt;,dit  always 
to  be  maintained,  while  tho  former,  as  tho  most  efticacious 
moans,  should  never  be  ue&lt;rlected. 

The  committee  acknowled/j^e  with  thankfulness  the  con- 
tinued patronage  of  friends  in  England,  and  further  entreat, 
with  renewed  earnestness,  the  attention  of  humane  and  christian 
individuals  to  tho  undertakings  of  the  yociety.  These  are  un- 
(jue^stionably  of  unspeakable  importance  to  the  well  being  of  the 
coinitry,  and  essential  to  tho  prosperity  of  the  Church  of  Eng- 
land :  to  whomsoever  these  are  dear,  to  them  will  the  success  of 
tho  Hociety  be  also  dear.  In  the  mean  time,  and  under  all 
circumstances,  the  committee  are  well  aware  that  the  Society 
should  endeavour  so  to  act  in  dependence  ui)on  the  Divine 
iissistance  as  to  ensure  a  continuance  of  the  Divine  favour  ;  a 
consideration  of  the  highest  moment.  Christian  beneficence  is 
the  subordinate  instrument  of  a  higher  and  efficient  agency. — 
'*  Neither  is  ho  that  planteth  any  thing,  nor  ho  that  watereth, 
but  God  that  giveth  the  increase."  Such  are  the  conditions 
of  all  labour  undertaken  from  the  motives  of  religious  bent*- 
volence,  and  especially  when  the  good  to  be  achieved  is  of  the 
hhjlwjit  kind. 

Succour  from /rJt'M(/.&gt;«  at  /lome  has  opportunely  provided  for 
the  excess  of  the  Society's  exi)enditure  over  its  income  during 
the  past  year.  To  them,  therefore,  the  committee  gladly  em- 
brace this  opportunity  of  tendering  their  warmest  tlumks,  and 
confident  that  the  present  statement  of  its  proceedings  Avill 
secure  for  the  Society  a  continuance  of  their  &lt;/oof(  opinion,  earnestly 
solicit  an  extension  of  their  mod  talnahle  aid.  Indeed,  without  this 
or  some  eipiivalent  assistance,  the  Society  cannot  maintain  its 
present  exertions,  being  under  engagements  exceeding  Two 
Hundred  and  Fifty  Pounds  Sterling  per  annum,  while  its 
receipts  in  Canada  do  not  amount  to  half  tho r  sum.

rilAVELLING  MISSIONARY  OF  THE  HOME  DISTRICT, 
UPPER  CANADA,  FOR  NOVEMBER,  1034. 

1  avail  myself  of  this  oi)portunity  to  express  my  joy  on 
liearing  that  the  Rev.  Mr.  llarpur  is  appointed  to  act  under  the 
ausiiices  of  the  Society.  The  period,  1  trust,  is  not  far  distant 
when  the  friends  of  the  Church  will  cease  to  be  influenced  by  tlie 
insinuation  of  designing  men,  and  that,  being  acquainted  with 
lier  real  extent  and  lamentable  destitution,  they  will  see  tlie 
wisdom  and  expediency  of  making  an  united  effort  to  afford  to 
ii'.T  scattered  members  the  means  of  grace,  and  rescue  them

from  the  (liiiif;t!rs  t&lt;»  wliii-h  they  an?  now  oxposrd,  l»y  .sondinf'' 
rcjjfuljiriy  ordaincfl  iiiiiiistcrs  to  tlic  reinott'Ht  parlfs  of  the  province. 

From  all  that  I  have  sccmi  and  heard  since  I  have  had  th«' 
hononr  of  lahourin^  for  the  society,  I  am  decidedly  of  opinion, 
that  while  tiie  means  of  maintaining  a  resi&lt;lent  (!l(»rf(ynian  iri 
t'ach  niML;lil)otirhoo(l  are  wantini,'',  as  the  plan  adopted  hy  the 
society  is  apostolical,  so  it  is  also  the  nw^f  rj'rtiial  for  diffnsinjif 
the  pare  liiflit  of  tin*  (Jospid,  and  for  estaldisniiif^  and  extendin&lt;^ 
thoChnrcli  of  onr  fathers  thi-onyhont  the  whole  conntry. 

As  to  the  alleij;e(l  a[)athy  of  Kpiscoj)alians,of  which  the  allied 
enoniie.s  of  the  Ciiurcli  so  ea^^erly  avail  themselves  in  their  en- 
deavonrs  to  supersede  her  niinistry,  I  am  persuaded  that  whero 
ai)athy  does  exist,  it  is  ifcnerally  to  Ix;  attributed  to  their  total 
duftttiitiuii  of  the  ministrations  of  the  Church,  and  of  Clergymen 
to  explain  and  defend  her  doctrim^s  and  discipline.  Notwith- 
standini;'  the  prc^sent  frccpu'Jicy  of  innovation  and  love  of  novelty, 
anticpiity  is  far  from  being  destitute  of  charms  even  in  this  new 
country ;  and  I  am  fully  convinced  that  wherever  onr  ancient 
ecclesiastical  ordinances,  forms  and  ceremonies,  are  i)resented  in 
a  true  light,  they  are  very  generally  acceptable  to  the  commiuiity, 
and  are  sure  to  connnand  the  attention  and  veneration  of  uU 
Protestant  Episcoi)alians.  But  as  you  are  well  acipuiinted  with 
tJiese  tilings,  and  are  better  able  than  1  am  to  represent  them  to 
the  society,  I  hasten  to  nuike  a  simple  statement  of  my  late  pro- 
ceedings since  I  last  addressed  you,  according  to  my  usual  plan, 
for  the  information  of  tin;  board.  It  will  be  seen  by  the  ac- 
companying tables,  that  in  the  month  of  November  last  I  offi- 
ciated thre(?  times  at  the  Gore  of  Toronto,  administered  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Sui)per  to  seventeen  persons,  and  bap- 
tized three  children.  Having  proceeded  to  the  township  of 
Scarbro',  I  also  officiated  three  tunes  in  that  neighbourhood  to 
numerous  and  attentivocongregations,and  baptized  four  children. 
On  Sunday  the  IGth  1  officiated  twice  for  the  llev.  Dr.  Phillips, 
at  Christ  Church,  in  the  township  of  Ktobicoke,  to  a  very  atten- 
tive congregation,  and  was  hapi)y  to  find  that  he  is  greatly  en- 
dearing himself  to  his  i)eople.  iMr.  Gamble  of  Mimico,  is  un- 
wearied in  patronizing  the  Sunday  school  in  that  neighbourhood, 
and  unceasing  in  his  endeavours  to  promote  the  prosperity  and 
efficieni'y  of  the  Churo'i. 

On  the  iJUh  I  proceeded  to  tlio  township  of  Toronto,  and 
thence  on  the  following  day  continued  my  journey  to  Esquesing. 
Travelling  was  scarcely  ever  more  disagreeable  :  the  roads  being 
bad,  the  sky  clouded,  and  the  woods  stripped  of  their  gay  attire, 
so  that  every  thing  woi'o  a  dreary  and  desolate  a])pearanci'. 

On  my  arrival  at  Ks(piesing  1  visited  several  families  belong- 
ing to  the  Church,  and  performed  divine  service  five  times  at 
different  places  in  the  township.  Twenty-six  i)ersons  received 
the  Holy  Communion,  and  one  adult  and  eleven  children  were 
baptized.  The  people  in  that  neighbourhood  express  the  greatest 
anxiety  for  the  stated  ministrations  of  religion.  There  can  bo 
few  parts  in  the  province  whero  a  Clergyman  is  more  needed,  it 
is  said  that  there  are  a  hundred  families  in  Esquesing  professing 
themselves  to  be  adherents  of  the  Church.  In  returning  from 
Esque:sing,  being  desired  by  some  members  of  the  Church  in

to  whom  after  readin«,'  tho  jMaycrs,  1  oxphiined  n  portion  of 
Scrii-'tiii'o  and  made  ol)sorvatn)ns  on  tlie  liturj^y.  Two  chihlrcn 
woro  liajitized  on  that  occasion.  'V\w  hitc  Hcv.  Mi-.  lJt)tiltoM

hooil — baptized  eleven  childienand  administered  the  lioly  Com- 
munion to  seventeen  persons.  I  need  hardly  ri'iniiid  you  that 
Kjjiscopalians  are  very  numerous  in  this  j)art  of  the  country.  Jn 
ptussin^'  tlirouf,'h  Etobicoke  on  my  return  from  'i'rafaljfar,  1  read 
l)rayers,  preached  and  l)aptized  two  children.  l*roceedin&lt;^  then 
wistward  1  proceeded  to  the  township  of  Whitby,  and  on  Sunday, 
Dec.  2lst  i)erformed  divine  service,  ma&lt;le  observations  on  the 
litur{,'y  and  preached  to  about  a  hundred  and  fifty  people.  1  also 
ofHciated  at  tho  same  i)lace  on  (.^hristmas-day,  on  tiuit  occasion 
.seventeen  persons  received  the  Holy  C'omnmnion,  and  one  child 
wius  l)aptized. 

liaviuii;  reached  the  townshij)s  of  Darlin&lt;;ton,  county  of 
Uurham,  Newcastlt)  district,  I  [&gt;erformed  divine  service  at  Jjow- 
tnauviile  on  Bunday  the  2}{th,  to  a  numerous  congrej^^ation  and 
baptized  a  child. 

H(;turnin&lt;i;  a&lt;^ain  to  Whitby,  I  officiated  in  the  rear  of  that 
tuwnsiiip  on  the  last  day  of  the  year,  and  selected  for  the  su])ject 
of  my  lecture  on  that  occasion,  "  Iledeemin&lt;^  the  time,  because 
the  days  are  evil."  The  next  day  I  read  prayers  and  preached 
in  another  part  of  the  neighbourhood  and  bai)tized  a  child. 
Directing  my  course  again  to  tho  west,  I  returned  to  I'ickering, 
and  officiated  in  that  township.  The  congregation  consisted  of 
about  eighty  people,  and  one  child  was  baptized. 

On  the  following  Sunday  1  i)erformed  divine  service  at  the 
house  of  Mr.  Stei)henson,  near  the  line  between  Whitby  and 
i'ickering.  The  congregation  did  not  amount  to  more  than  fifty 
people,  but  they  were  principally  Episcopalians,  and  two  cliildren 
were  l)a})tized. 

On  the  following  day  I  again  performed  the  service  of  tlu' 
Church  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Jhi tier,  a  steadfast  member  of  the 
Church,  and  baptized  five  children — about  fifty  persons  were 
present.  On  the  evening  of  the  next  day  X  read  prayers  and 
made  observations  on  tho  liturgy,  preaching  to  upwards  of  sixty 
persons,  and  baptizing  two  children,  at  tho  house  of  Mr.  Lettle, 
in  tho  seventh  concession  of  Pickering.  The  number  of  P^pisco- 
paliaus  is  much  increased  in  this  township  since  my  first  visit  to 
the  township. 

On  Friday  the  IGth  of  Jan.  I  proceeded  to  the  township  of 
Markham,  and  on  the  following  Sunday  re.ad  prayers,  i)reached, 
lectured  on  the  liturgy  and  baptized  Ctnir  children.  Upwards  of 
one  hundred  and  fifty  people  werepresent  uiid  were  very  attentive.

doubt  tiiat  tlio  service  of  the  (.'hiirch  wouKl  he  W(?ll  attended. 

Un  Monday  the  l!)th  I  paid  a  visit  to  the  llev.  Mr.  Maver- 
holFer,  and  continucMl  my  journey  the  next  (hiy  to  lJxhri(Ij^(j ; 
bcfin;^  invited,  I  h)d;;(;d  the  first  ni^lit  ot"  my  arrival  in  tiiat  town- 
Hliip,  at  tlie  house  of  Mv,  Zekiel  .lames,  a  respeetahh*  memher  of 
th(^  society  of  friends.  Wo  were  mucli  ahu'nu&gt;d  in  the  ni^ht  on 
discoverin;jf  that  a  huihliii;,'  near  the  house  was  in  iiames  ;  hut 
litth^  in.jiii'y  was  done,  the  weather  heinj;  calm,  and  an  exceUent 
]mmp  near  th(!  house,  tiu;  lire  was  soon  extin;.fuishe«l.  In  the 
saiiK?  nei^hhourhood  on  tlie 'J'iiid  I  read  prayers,  preached,  and 
exphiinecl  some  parts  of  th(^  Churcli  catechism  and  the  Church 
service  to  ahove  sixty  peojih',  and  haptized  a  cliihl. 

From  Uxhrid^a'  I  [jroceeded  to  IJrock,  wiier(?  I  ofticiated 
several  times  at  different  places.  As  usual,  larj^e  assemhla;;'es 
ofi)ersonK,  i)rofessin^  to  he;  adherents  to  the  Churcii,  attended 
divine  sisrvice  on  tl;e  Sundays,  and  the  con;,n*ei;atioiis  on  other 
days  were  far  from  hein;,''  small.  Several  children  were  ha])- 
tized,  and  fifteen  |)ersons  received  the  Jloly  Communion.  I 
need  scarcely  repeat  on  this  occasion  what  1  have  so  often  stated 
to  you,  that  a  C'rurch  is  very  much  wanted  in  this  neif^hhour- 
liood.  r  am  not  aware  that  any  hind  has  yet  heeii  set  jii&gt;art  in 
JJrock  by  his  Kxcelloncy  the  Lieutenant  Ciovernor  for  a  ^lohe, 
but  Mr.  N'^rooman,  who  is  an  J'jpiscopalian,  offers  to  f;ive  a  deed 
of  six  acres  of  land,  in  a  central  situation,  to  the  liisliop,  for  the 
sites  of  a  Church  and  Parsonage  House  and  Burial  Ground. 

On  Sunday,  February  1st,  I  performed  divine  service  at  the 
house  of  Mr,  Stephenson,  in  the  township  of  lirock.  Thou;^h 
the  weather  was  extremely  cold,  about  two  hundred  people  wen; 
present,  fifteen  received  the  Holy  Connnunioii,  and  one  child 
•was  baptized. 

Tuesday  the  3rd,  I  proceeded  to  Mr.  Cowan's,  near  the  lino 
between  Brock  and  Thorah  ;  and  the  next  day  read  prayers  and 
preached  at  his  liouse. 

On  Thursday  the  5th,  accompanied  by  Mr.  Thorn]  on,  I 
visited  Mr.  Gil)l&gt;s,  in  the  township  of  Thorah,  and  was  received 
with  ^reat  kindness  by  himself  and  family.  Friday  (ith,  I  con- 
tinued my  journey  with  Mr.  Gibbs  to  Georgina,  and  remained  all 
ni/^ht  at  Mr.  Osborne's. 

Sunday  the  Uth,  officiated  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Fairburn,  sixth 
concession  of  Georgina.  The  weather  being  extremely  cold  and 
stormy,  not  more  than  thirty  })ersons  were  present,  but  they 
wore  very  attentive,  and  j)rincipally  members  of  the  Church. 
On  Tuesday  the  lOth,  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  at  the  house  of 
Mr.  Fairburn  to  about  forty  people. 

On  Sunday  the  loth  I  performed  divine  service  and  preached 
in  the  morning  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Camming,  and  in  tiie  even- 
ing again  at  Mr.  Fairburn's,  to  a  very  attentive  assemblage  of 
people. 

Tuesday  the  1 7th,  read  prayers  and  preached  again  at  Mr. 
Fairburn's  to   thirty  people.      Wednesday  the   Ifith,   I   visited

On  tlM''J4th  I  reached  Voni;e-street. 

On  the  -'7tli  1  visited  some  of  the  inhaltitants  of  Whit- 
c)iiirch,  in  the  vicinity  of  Neu  market,  was  widl  received  by  the

On  Ash-Wednesday,  the  4th,  1  ri-ad  prayi&gt;rs  and  pi-eachod 
ut  Newmarket  to  thirty  i»e(([)le,  and  afterwards  visited  some  of 
the  intinhers  of  tlie  Church. 

On  the  oth  I  visited  some  of  the  adherents  of  the  ('hurch  in 
KiiMt  (J\villind)ury  and  W^hitchurcli. 

On  Sunday  the  JIth,  1  iii^ain  performed  divine  service  twice 
at  Newmarket,  administered  the  Holy  Commuiuon  to  thirteen 
persons,  and  baptized  two  children.  On  this  occasion  the  con-

u.sually  the  case  iji  this  couutiy,  a  considerable  number  of

On  Fi  idiiv  tlio  2()th,  T  proeecdcd  to  West  Gwillimhury.  On 
the  21st  1  visited  some  of  the  inhabitants,  and  on  Sunday  the 
22nd  pert'onned  divine  service  and  preached  to  ahont  forty 
persons.  Thoni,di  the  weather  was  (ixtreniely  stormy,  many 
j)Ooi&gt;le  from  Teenmseth  weie  present. 

Tuesday  tiie  24th,  1  j)roceeded  to  the  tenth  concession  of  the 
township  and  preuclu'd  to  thirty  ]&gt;eo]&gt;le,  and  hajjtized  a  child. 

Wednes(hiy  tlie  2')tli,  1  otticiated  at  a  scliool-liouse  in  the 
sixth  concession  ;  thirty  ])eoplo  attended.  On  Thursday  the 
20th,  I  read  prayers  and  preached  at  the  house  of  Mr,  Kerr,  in 
the  tenth  concession  ;  twenty  persons  were  ])rescnt  and  three 
childnMi  baptize  1. 

Friday  the  27th,  beinu;^  particidarly  re(piested,  I  returned 
a'j;ain  to-clay  to  Newmarket,  to  otHciate  at  the  funenil  of  Mr. 
Jluit,  whose  brother  died  onlv  ten  &lt;hivs  auo.  After  rcadinijf  the 
inij)r(^ssive  service  of  our  Churcli,  I  aj^ain  addressed  the  peo])k; 
at  tiie  ^rave,  as  on  the  foi-iner  occasion,  ujton  sucli  to[)ics  as  tiu' 
nudanclioly  occasion  su^'i,a.'sted,  and  v.ent  back  in  the  eveninj^'  to 
WoHt  Gwillindjury. 

On  Saturday  tlie  2Uth,  I  ])roceuded  to  Tocumseth,  and  on 
Sunday  the  21Hli,  performed  divine  service  and  jjreuched  at  Mr. 
Osmond's  scliool-house,  ni'ar  the  new  Churcli.  The  weatlicr  wju- 
extremely  unfavourable,  but  a  numerous  assend)hii,fe  of  people 
attended.  On  Monday  the  liOth,  I  visited  some  of  the  members 
of  the  Church  and  baptized  two  children  ;  and  on  Tuesday  tlie 
21st,  1  read  j)rayers  and  ])reached  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Coffey  to 
about  forty  persons.  Keturnin&lt;f  to  AV^est  (iwillimbury  I  performed 
divine  service  there  on  Sunday  the  5th  of  Ai)ril,  and  thouLrh 
the  weather  was  very  unfavourable,  the  ])eople  were  obliged  to 
u.s.sonible  in  a  barn,  a  very  inconvenient  jdace,  especially  in  this 
country,  for  the  decent  performance  of  sacred  duties.  It  was 
supi)osed  that  two  hundred  and  fifty  jieople,  mostly  E[»iscopa- 
lians,  were  ])resent,  but  only  seven  persoiLs  remained  to  receive 
the  Holy  Coinuiunion.  This  apathy,  thoui,di  the  natural  conse- 
quence of  the  spiritual  destitution  in  which  the  people  have  been 
left,  is  greatly  to  be  lamented,  and  evinces  in  the  strongest  light 
the  necet;sity  of  exertion,  to  give  them  the  regular  i)reaehing  of 
God's  word,  nn&lt;l  the  admonitions,  the  i)resence,  and  the  prayers 
of  his  ministers,  more  frecpiently  among  the  people.  Upon 
some  occasions,  however,  in  the  same  neighbourhood,  I  have 
administered  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  to  above  thirty 
persons. 

On  the  follow'ing  morning,  after  baptizing  a  child,  I  retraced 
my  way  to  Tecuinseth,  and  on  Tuesday  the  7th  I  read  prayers, 
made  observations  on  the  liturgy,  baptized  a  child  and  preached 
to  a  considerable  assemblage  of  j)eople,  near  the  town  line 
between  Tecums'eth  and  West  Gwillinibury.  The  next  day  I 
proceeded  to  Essa,  officiated  to  about  thirty  persons  at  the  hou.se 
of  r&gt;Ir.  Perry  and  bai)tized  three  children. 

On  Friday  the  10th,  I  performed  divine  sei-viceat  the  house 
of  Mr.  Davis,  in  the  west  part  of  Tecumseth.  The  weather 
being  very  favourable,  the  people  mr*;  in  a  barn,  and  several  of 
them  from  Adjala  had  travelled  a  considerable  distance.  On 
thi.s  occasion,  1  explained  a  part  of  the  service  of  the  .Church,

Arrivinjj^  in  the  township  of  Innistilon  \Vednes(hiy  the  ITith, 
I  visitcHl  S(!veral  of  the  inhabitants  :  1  read  prayc'rs  and  preaehed 
in  that  nei;;hl)()iirhood  on  (Joitd  Fi-iday,  in  a  small  loi;  sehool- 
house,  wliii'h  beini^  in  an  nntinished  state,  and  the  weatliisr 
extremely  stm'my,  the  people  were  much  ineomnioded  by  thu 
cold.     Thirty  persons  attended,  and  one  child  was  baptized. 

Ilavinf;  reached  IJai'iie,  Keiiipenfcddt  IJay,  I  performed 
divine  service  there  twice  o?»  Sunday  the  IDtli.  'J'he  coni,'re^}i- 
tion  amounted  to  upwards  of  seventy  persons,  and  four  children 
were  biipti/.ed.  After  bai&gt;tizini;  another  child  the  followinj^

Ijurrie,  thiity  persons  attendin&lt;f. 

On  tlu&gt;  lollowin&lt;^Snnda&gt;,  tIio2(5th,  I  otticiated  at  a  sclu)ol  in 
the  townsjiip  (»f  N'espra  :  a  hu'ufe  assembla^i^e  of  people  were 
j)reseut,  to  whom  1  explained  a  i)ai't  of  the  liturj^y,  preached, 
and  baptized  eleven  children.  Jteturnin;^  in  the  evening  to 
Keuipenfeldt,  I  preached  to  thirty  people,  and  the  next  day 
proceeded  to  &gt;Medonte.  baptized,  visited  some  of  the  inhabituntH. 
a.id  preached  to  a  few  people  who  met  together  to  hear  me  at 
night. 

On  the  2JHh,  I  arrived  at  Capt.  Anderson's,  and  proaclied 
on  the  Thursday  following  to  the  Indians  at  Coldwater,  and 
baptized  a  child. 

J  laving  reached  Penetanguishine,  I  officiated  several  times 
in  ditferent  parts  of  that  ludyhbourhood,  and  baptized  a  con- 
sideiable  number  of  chihlren.  Thirteen  persons  received  the 
ISiK-rameut  of  the  Lord's  Supper. 

As  1  returned  to  Coldwater  on  Tuesday  the  r2th,  I  again 
read  pi-ayers  and  preached  at  Medonte,  to  a  small  but  attentive 
congregation,  and  baptized  three  cliildren. 

Arriving  at  the  Nai-rows,  [^ake  Simcoe,  on  Sunday  the  17th, 
I  read  j)rayeis  ami  j)reaclied  to  a  very  respectable  congregation, 
and  in  the  evening  of  the  same  day  ))ieached  to  tlu;  inilians 
residing  at  the  village.  About  a  hundred  of  them  were  present 
and  very  attentive. 

Findiii;&lt;-  that  Cai)tain  Anderson  had  not  vet  been  enabled 
to  mai&lt;e  the  necessary  arrangements  for  our  excursn)n  among 
liie  Indians,  (an  account  of  which  is  sultjoined,)  I  returned  to 
Penetanguishine,  and  officiated  twice  in  that  neighbourhood,  on 
Simdav  the  24th.  The  congregation  at  the  military  establish- 
ment  there  usually  exceeds  a  hundred,  and  at  the  town  to  about 
forty  persons.  A  c()nsi&lt;lerable  number  of  discharged  soldiers, 
with  their  families,  having  lately  arrived  at  Penetanguishine,  and 
a  part  of  them  being  Protestants,  the  congregation  of  (Jhurch 
I»eoplo  is  now  increased.     They  are  a  very  poor  class  of  people.

and  somo  of  tlioin  mucli  afflicted  with  sickncsH,  but  soeni  to  Ik* 
greatly  onroura-^od  in  thoir  distress,  hv  tlie  active  bonovolencoof 
his  Excellency  Sir  John  Colhorne,  who  has  f,'ivcn  them  permis- 
sion to  reside;  on  the  military  reserve,  and  authorized  h)&lt;r 
oottaj^es  to  be  built  for  their  accommodation.  I  observed  with 
pleasure  that  Jjieut.  Jnii;all  and  Adjutant  Kint,',  as  also  other 
j^entlemen  residinj^  at  the  station,  promptly  rendered  every 
Uijaistance  and  kindness  in  their  power. 

On  Monday  tiie  2r)th,  1  visited  the  Settlers  in  different 
parts  of  the  nei^hl)ourhood,  who,  as  is  usually  the  case,  exj)ressed 
their  re&lt;jret  at  remainin&lt;j;  so  lon«^  destitute  of  a  minister.  Several 
members  of  the  Churcii  in  the  vicinity  of  Penctan^iiishine, 
liavinj^  seen  a  co])y  of  the  Society's  last  report,  seem  desirous 
to  contvibute  in  aid  of  its  funds.  In  the  evening  a  few  of  the 
neighbours  havinjr  met  at  the  honso  of  Air.  llawson,  on  the  west 
side  of  the  harbour,  I  took  occasion  to  addi-ess  and  exhort 
them  on  relii;ious  subjects.  Upon  enquiry,  I  was  happy  to  iiear, 
that  thoui,di  the  ])eople  in  that  remote  part  of  the  country  an' 
without  the  i)ubli(r  ministrations  of  relii^'ion,  several  persons 
belon&lt;r!nj2;  to  ourCiiurch  set  the  j^ood  exami)le  to  others  of  daily 
attending  to  the  i-eading  of  God's  Word,  and  the  worshipi)inm 
Him  in  their  families.  1  have  no  doubt  that  a  Clergyman  might 
be  easily  found  desirous  of  residing  at  Penetanguishine.  Such 
of  the  inhabitants  as  are  not  llomanists  are  chiefly  Episcopalians, 
and  it  is  a  delightful  situation  for  persons  who  are  pleased  and  en- 
tertained by  the  wild  grandeur  and  simplicity  of  nature,  and  par- 
ticularly so  during  the  sunnner  months.  The  pnre  waters  of  the 
beautiful  bay,  and  the  verdant  foliage  of  tiie  vast  woods  which 
adorn  its  sloping  shores,  are  at  this  season  i)articnlarly  gi-atifying 
to  the  sight.  The  nulitary  establishment,  and  also  the  new  village 
which  has  been  lately  erected,  emboweied  with  green  woodt-, 
on  the  east  side  of  the  harbour,  present  a  very  pleasing  prospect 
from  the  opposite  shore.  The  land,  however,  in  that  neighbour- 
hood, is  of  an  inferior  kind  :  the  soil  is  sandy,  and  the  stones  on 
its  surface  are  very  numerous,  but  with  culture  it  is  not  unpro- 
ductive, and  nuikes  excellent  gardens. 

I  next  i)roceeded  to  the  township  of  Flos,  on  Thursday  the 
2{H.h,  where  I  baptized  two  children,  and  lectured  their  parentis 
and  others  who  were  pi'esent  on  baptism  and  other  religious 
subjects  as  the  occasion  suggested. 

On  the  30th,  1  visited  several  families  in  the  townships  of 
Flos  and  INIedonte,  and  met  with  an  interesting  young  man  who 
has  been  ill  some  time.  His  knowledge  of  religious  things  is 
(x)nsiderable,  but  he  does  not  yet  enjoy  that  peace  of  mind, 
which  it  is  the  privilege  of  Christians  to  attain.  In  the  evening 
I  was  met  by  about  twenty  persons,  to  whom,  after  having  read 
u  part  of  the  prayers,  I  explained  the  second  lesson  appointed 
for  the  evening  service. 

On  Sunday  the  last  day  of  May,  I  officiated  in  a  school  at 
Vespra,  and  a  numerous  and  attentive  assemblage  of  people 
were  present.  Having  read  the  prayers,  I  made  observations 
on  several  parts  of  the  liturgy,  preached,  and  baptized  two 
children.    Divine  service  being  ended,  I  proceeded  immediately 


&gt;    i 


to  tlic  towiishi])  of  Flos,  to  visit  tlio  sick  person  I  liavi^  just 
Ijc'fovo  montionod,  nnd  road,  exhorted,  and  jji-ayed,  with  him 
and  Iiis  relations. 

Uetnrnin&lt;j  afi;ain  to  ^fedonte  in  tlie  ovenini,'',  I  was  ^^ratified 
to  find,  that  thouf,di  the  weather  was  extremely  wet,  a  numerous 
eonfrref^ation  of  people  were  waitini,'  for  mo  in  a  dwellin*,'  iiouse, 
to  whom,'after  readinfjf  prayers,  I  i&gt;reaeljed,  and  then  l)aj)tize&lt;l 
a  ehild.  I  was  a  jjood  deal  indisposed  during'  the  day,  which 
increased  at  ni^dit,  hut  felt  (piite  restored  next  mornin&lt;r. 

Cajjtain  Anderson  and  I  purpose  leavin&lt;r  Coldwater  on  the 
10th,  and  even  ox])cct  that  a  considerable  mimher  of  Indiana 
will  have  assembled  to  receive  us  when  we  reach  the  lyianitoulin 
Island.  About  two  days  aji^o,  I  had  an  opportunity,  throuj^h 
Capt.  Anderson,  who  interpreted  for  mo,  of  conversini;^  with  a 
lieathen  Indian  from  the  northern  shore  of  Lake  Huron.  He 
said  ho  knew  nothing;  about  relii^ion,  but  iri»hi'(f  to  he  instructe&lt;l, 
and  to  settle  with  his  family  on  the  Manitoulin  Island.  He 
also  told  mo  that  he  would  adopt  the  religion  of  his  English 
Fathers  and  none  else.  This  man  will  proceed  from  Penetan- 
guishine  in  company  with  us,  and  I  trust  will  be  found  nsoful 
in  assisting  us  to  collect  his  Indian  countrymen.

APPENDIX  A,  PAGE  95,  FIFTH  REPORT 
OF  THE  TORONTO  SOCIETY. 

EifracU  from  a  letter  addressed  to  hist  Excellency  Sir  John  Colborve 
from  Captain  Anderson,  Superintendent  of  the  Indian  l)e}iartment  on, 
Lakes  Huron  and  Simcoe  in   Upj)er  Canada,  communicated  by  hi» 
Edcell'iccy  to  the  Bishoj)  of  Quebec,  and  by  the  Bishop  to  "  2'he  Society 
"  at  Toronto  for  Converting  and  Civilizing  the  Indians  and  Propa- 
"(jatinij  the  Gospel  among  destitute  Settlers  in  Upper  Canada,^  dated 
Uth  Sept.,  1835. 
It  is  now  five  years  since,  by  the  direction  of  your  Excellency, 
I  undertook  the  settlement  and  civilization  of  threo  tribes  of 
Indians  at  Coldwater  and  the  Narrows  of  Lake  Simcoe.  It  will  be 
necessary  to  look  at  the  past  condition  of  these  people  and  compare 
it  with  the  present.    Many  anxious  friends  of  the  Indians  occa- 
sionally express  great  disappointment  that  greater  progress  has 
not  been  made,  and  to  every  one  it  must  be  a  matter  of  regret  that

to  th(?  jn'oprioty  of  intcM-forinj,'' to  aniciKl  tlioir  coiiditi(&lt;n.  It  is 
only  thcrcfoi'o  hy  lv('('j)in;&gt;'  in  view  tli&lt;'ii'  actuiil  stiitc  Ix'forc 
measurcH  were  taken  to  assist  tlicir  civilization,  that  any  fair 
OKtiinatc  can  be  fornuMl  of  the  advanta^^avs,  or  disa(lvanta;,'(&gt;s,  of 
tJioso  mcasnros  ;  1  have  also  to  ui'^c  that  it  must  !)(&gt;  boriu*  in 
mind,  tliat  niiu-h  opjxisition  has  continually  arisen  from  tlie 
necessity  of  n)ixin&lt;^  ditfenfUt  reli&lt;rious  [)ersuasions. 

]*i"ior  to  the  year  MVM)  tliese  ti'ihos  liad  become  much 
demoralized  from  their  lon^  settlement  near  wliiti;  stations. 
'J'liey  were  in  the  constant  habit  of  drinkin&lt;&gt;sj)ii'ituous  li(|uors  to 
excess — not  on(?  of  them  coidd  I'ead  or  write,  and  they  scarcely 
knew  any  tliin;!;  of  relji^ion.  Their  huntin;^'  grounds  were  ex- 
hausted ;  their  {government  presents  were  exclian^'ed  forwJiisKev, 
tlicy  were  in  debt  to  all  the  traders,  and  unable  to  obtain  more 
credit,  wore  thus  constantly  in  a  state  borderiuf^-  on  stai'vation. 
Their  sufFerin^r  and  misery  were  stron&lt;&gt;ly  iparked  in  their 
personal  a])])earance  and  the  condition  of  their  wi^-wams,  the 
latter  im])erfectly  made,  and  \ijry  i'lsufticiently  supjilied  with 
fuel,  could  scarcely  be  said  to  afford  shelter  to  the  raf^ged  and 
emaciated  frames  of  the  elder  Indians— whilst  the  wretchedly 
diseased  ai)pearance  of  the  children  sj)oko  still  more  f&lt;n-cibly  df 
the  intoxication  and  want  of  food  of  the  jiarents.  Miserable  as 
was  their  state,  it  will  hardly  be  credited  that  their  minds  were 
so  debased,  their  listlessnessand  letharf&gt;^y  so^reat,  that  it  required 
considerable  persuasion  to  prevail  on  them  to  accej)t  the  bounty 
of  f^overnment.  Jiy  studious  attention  to  their  habits  and  preju- 
dices, they  were  at  length  {gradually  brought  to  assist,  and  tlie 
penei-al  result  has  been,  that  each  Indian  witli  a  family,  has  now  a 
little  farm  nnder  cultivation,  on  which  he  raises  not  only  potatoes 
and  Indian  corn,  but  also  wheat,  oats,  ])eas,  cVlc.  His  wigwam  is 
exchanged  for  the  log-house  ;  hunting  has  in  many  cases  been 
altogether  laid  aside,  and  in  none  api)ears  as  formerly,  to  l)o 
resorted  to  as  the  only  means  of  subsistence  ;  habitual  intoxica- 
tion is  unknown  ;  the  Sabbath  is  carefully  observed, their  religious 
duties  strictly  attended  to  ;  and  reading  and  writing,  with  a 
moderate  knowledge  of  arithmetic,  is  {ilmost  universal  among 
the  young  j)eople. 

I  attach  great  importance  to  their  habits  of  drunkenness 
being  overcome  ;  at  first  it  was  necessary  to  prohibit  the  bringing 
spiiits  within  the  bounds  of  the  settlement — the  near  .approacli 
of  the  ichiU:  i^dtlei'K  has  rendered  this  restriction  no  longer  i)Ossible, 
and  yet  instances  of  intoxication  ai"e  very  seldom  met  with, 
whilst  rjumerous  examples  may  be  brought  forward  of  total 
abstinence  from  ardent  spirits. 

The  log  dwelling  houses  for  the  Indians  wore  ei-ected  by 
government — frame  houses  for  the  superintendent  and  the  two 
chiefs,  Aisance  and  Yellowhead,  with  school-houses  at  Coldwator 
and  the  Narrows,  were  also  built  at  the  commencement  of  the 
establishment.  Since  that  time  a  saw  mill  and  a  grist  mill  ha.s 
been  added  at  Coldwater,  and  a  saw  mill  is  in  progress  at  the 
Narrows,  About  five  hiindred  acres  in  the  whole  have  been 
cleared  and  are  under  cultivation,  and  it  is  very  gratifying  to 
observe  this  year,  that  many  of  the  Indians  are,  of  their  own

as  to  pi'event  th(&gt;  total  c^vtinction  of  their  race,  I  was  induced  tu

His  Excellency  .Sir  John Colhorne,  the  Lieutenant  Governor,

were  taken  for  forminj^-  a  Missionary  (&gt;stahlishnient  on  the  Mani-

The  following,'  observations  res])ectin&lt;i;'  the  Indians  residin;^ 
on  the  northern  coast  of  Lake  Iluron,  whom  I  have  lately 
visited,  and  others  from  more  distant  ])arts  with  whom  I  have 
liad  communication,  are  si)bmitted  for  the  information  of  tlic 
Society.  I  have  ^reat  pleasure  in  beinjr  enal)led  to  state,  t'liit 
the  encouragement  accompanyinjjf  iny  excursion  has  far  exceeded 
my  expectation.  It  is  to  be  hoi)ed  Divine  Provideui^e  is 
preijarinj^  a  way  for  the  speedy  ])rotnotion  of  that  branch  of 
the  Society's  original  design,  ameliorating  the  condition  of  the 
long  neglected  Indians  of  this  country  tiirough  the  medium  of 
the  Church. 

The  necessary  arrangements  for  our  voy^age  being  made  hy 
Captain  Anderson,  who  accom])anied  me,  we  proceeded  from 
Penetanguishine  on  Saturday  June  loth,  in  an  excellent  bark 
canoe,  furnished  with  men  from  the  establishment  at  Coldwator 
and  Lake  Simcoe.  The  weather  was  fine,  but  the  wind  beiii^' 
adverse,  we  only  travelled  about  ten  miles,  and  having  reached 
a  small  island,  our  tents  were  pitched  on  its  rocky  shore.  The 
following  day  being  Sunday  we  spent  in  the  same  spot.  Tho

the  •,''l&lt;)ouiv  rock,  and  tiie  crowdeil  c'on_i,M'ej^atI()n  of  the  "  jovoua 
city." 

On  tlic  morninu;  of  ^Monday  tlie  I7th,  wo  awoko  just  as  tlie 
ym\  seemed  to  (Mnernf(.  tVoni  the  rocks  which  rise  ahove  tho 
surface  of  the?  waters,  and  having  i-ead  a  jiortion  of  Scriptuni 
and  pi'ayed,  we  travelled  many  miles  lu'fore  breakfast.  I 
endeavoured  to  read  sitting'-  in  the  canoe,  but  could  not  succood 
en  account  of  drowsiness,  whicli  I  coidd  not  overcome.  The 
\ve:itlter  was  tine,  and  the  Indians  cauj^iit  several  fish  as  our 
!i&lt;fiit  vessel  elided  pust  the  rocks  which  every  where  abound  in 
tliat  part  of  the  lake. 

in  the  afternoon  an  [ndian  lodj^e  aj^peared  in  the  distance, 
oil  the  side  of  a  small  island  neiir  the  nortliern  shore.  Heinj; 
(h'sirous  to  converse  with  the  innuites  on  t)H&gt;  subject  of  religion, 
we  landed,  and  found  a  few  wiirwanis  iniiabited  by  Matwa-aushe, 
and  a  part  of  his  tribe. 

Having'  erected  our  tents  on  an  adjacent  ishnul,  we  after- 
wards had  an  opportunity  of  addressin&lt;^  the  Indians  as  they 
reclined  on  a  rock. 

(V.ptain  Anderson  stated  to  them  the  object  of  our  mission 
in  their  own  diahn-t.     Tlie  Chief  replied  that  he  had  reflected 
on  civilization  and  religion,  but  that  ho  was  not  3'et  prepared 
to  chanf^e  his  mode  of  life,  osiiecially  as  he  had  not  consulted 
tlie  whole  of  his  tribe.     I  then   explained  to  him  some  of  the 
principal  truths  of  Christianity,  warned  him  of  the  danj^er  of 
delay,  aiul  (&gt;xhorted   him  and   ids  ])eoi)le  to  be  j)artakers  of  the 
blessin&lt;i^s  of  relit^ion.     The  next  day  wo  could  not  continue  onr 
course,  the  lake  beinf]f  aji;itated  by  a  furious  north  wind.    While 
we  were  at  breakfast,  the  wife  of  ^latwa-aushe,  with  another 
woman  and  a  little  bo}',  paid  us  a  visit.     I  believe  their  object 
was  to  obtain  some  food,  as  their  sup])ly  of  fish  is  but  scanty. 
Wo  reminded  them  of  tlie  advantages  attending  Christianity, 
niul  asked  them  Avhy  they  did  not  endeavour  to  persuade  their 
husbands  to  attend  to  the  means  of  becoming  religious.    They 
exitressed  a  wish  that  the  men  would  accojit  ttie  oflFer,  and  said 
that  they  should  be  happy  to  follow   their  example.     In  the 
morning  of  the   same   day,  two  young  Indians  came  to   our 
encampment,  who  had   been  sent  by  the  Methodists  to  confer 
with   the   natives   in    the  vicinity   of  the   French   River,  and 
remained  with  us  till  the  storm  ceased.     On  the  followinj;  dav, 
the  weather  having  moderated,  we  were  enabled  to  pursue  our 
mazy  course  among  the  rocks.     The  Indians  being  exceedingly 
mild  and  obliging,  it  is  agreeable  to  travel  with  them,  and  it  is 
amusing  and  pleasing  to  see  their  skill  and  dexterity  in  spearing 
fish,  and  also  in  steering  their  frail  canoe  without  suffering  her 
to  sustain  the  least  injury  from  the  pointed  rocks.      Having 
proceeded  a  considerable  distance,  we  had  an  opportunity  of

convtM'sin;,'  witli  ii  snuill  bund  of  Iiidiaiis,  wlio  said  tlicy  wcro 
dcsiroiis  to  Join  the  Cliristiaii  Indians  at  C'oldwatcr,  hut  {'(Mild 
not  think  of  It'avinjr  the  rc;^Mon.s  where  tiicir  fatlicfs  lived 
and  died.  We  also  reniaini"'  a  few  minutes  uitii  another 
tril)o  of  IndiauM  encamped  near  the  mouth  of  French  Jtiver, 
a  part  of  wh(jm  an;  attaelied  to  th(&gt;  Methodists,  who  are  en- 
deavouring; to  induce  them  and  their  eliihlren  to  attend  to  tiieir 
instructions. 

On  tlie  18th  and  l!)th,  the  weather  was  unfavouralde,  and 
th(!  hiii(;  t(Mnj)estuous.  Our  canoe  was  in  (hm^'er  of  hein^  carrii'd 
away  from  the  coast  I»y  the  vioU'iice  of  the  wind,  hut  wo 
snccei'ded  in  maintainini,'  our  sinuous  way  amon^''  the  rocks, 
which,  in  some  nn^asure,  shelteivd  us  from  tlu-  fury  of  tht^ 
tempest.  Wo  were  now  entertained  with  a  distant  view  of  a 
riin;jC{!  of  rocky  mountains  on  the  northern  siiore,  wiiich,  thou&lt;;h 
not  of  t  lie  frreatest  luM^ht,  were  of  consiih'iahh;  ma^nitu(U&gt;,  and 
raise  their  ci'af^f^y  summits  liifJflv  ahovi;  the  surroinidin;^;  wastes. 
As  we  apiM'oaclu'd  these  h)ftier  eminences,  we  conhl  ch'arly 
discern  that  they  were  tliinly  covered  witli  trees  and  shrn])s  ; 
and  we  found  the  rocks  in  their  vicinity  much  more  steep  and 
cliffy  tiian  any  we  had  seen  during;  our  excursion.  Near  these 
mountains  we  l()dj,^ed  at  one  of  Mr.  Mitchell's  trading*-  posts,  and 
were  kindly  treated,  in  the  ahsiMice  of  his  Ji;,'elit,  hy  two 
Caimdians.  Early  in  the  evening  of  the  20th  we  arrived  at 
the  i^^reat  Manitoulin  Island,  and  were  received  and  welcomed 
hy  a  crowd  of  Indiatis,  at  the  head  of  an  extensive  and  ])(?autiful 
bay.  A  part  of  them  are  Ottawas,  and  adiierents  to  the  Itomish 
Church,  the  rest  ai-e  Potai^anasties,  and  not  yet  attached  to  any 
denomination  of  Christians.  Some  of  them  have  been  residing 
there  two  or  three  years,  and  have  cultivated  a  small  portion  of 
land.  Four  little  log  buildings  have  also  been  erected.  The 
soil  on  that  jiart  of  the  island  seems  good,  and  the  corn  and 
potatoes  in  the  plantations  look  well. 

On  the  day  after  our  an-ival,  being  Sunday,  I  preached  to 
the  Indians,  ami  nearly  all  of  them  att  -nded.  Caiitain  Ander- 
son was  kind  enough  to  interi)ret,  and  spoke  with  fluency  and 
animation.  Some  of  the  Indians  afterwards  told  us  that  they 
would  not  accept  our  otter,  because  certain  traders  had  dissuaded 
them  from  becoming  Christians.  Shawenausoway,  a  chief  who 
was  present,  said  that  he  would  attach  himself  to  the  Church  if 
another  chief  who  was  absent,  would  also  become  a  Christian  ; 
he  and  a  few  others  belonging  to  his  tribe  have  since  consented 
to  join  the  Church. 

Aince,  the  chief  who  engaged  to  meet  ns  at  the  island,  re- 
mained there  last  autumn,  till  he  deai'ed  a  piece  of  land.  We 
were  a  little  disappointed  in  not  finding  him  and  his  peo])le  as 
we  expected  ;  (set;  fourth  rei)ort,  ])age  43 — 44,)  but  we  were  in- 
formed by  the  Indians  that  he  had  not  altered  his  intention,  and 
that  he  was  prevented  from  coming  in  the  spring  by  unforeseen 
and  unavoidable  occurrences. 

As  the  account  given  tht)  preceding  year  of  this  engagement 
gives  a  simple  and  interesting  view  of  the  state  of  the  Indian 
mind,  I  win  venture  to  break  the  thread  of  the  journal  by  in- 
serting it  here.     The  account  is  also  Mr.  Elliot's.

"  A  cunsideral)le  nnmliei'  of  the  Methodist  Indians  having 
'*  arriveil  on  the  foUowinLf  mo^nin^^  Mr.  I'eter  Jones  said,  that 
*'  shoidd  1  he  desirous  of  preachinfi'  to  them  and  their  Heathen

"  ilii\in;.&gt;;  informed  him  that  I  should  he  hajipy  to  aililress  them, 
"  we  woi'o  soon  surrounded  hy  a  lar^e  assemblai^i'.  They  all 
"  I'cclinfd  on  tiie  i^rass  in  silence,  some  in  the  Council  House, 


"and  others    in    the   open   air;    the

'*  tohacco,  hut  the  professors  of  Christianity  liehavini&gt;'  like  civi- 
*'  li/ed  people.  As  soon  as  they  had  all  assembled,  Assickener, 
"  a  c  ever  Konian  Catholic  Indian,  stood  up  jind  addr&lt;.'ssed  his 
"  cu!intrymen,  callinj,'  upon  them  all  to  listen  with  attention  to 
"  what  I  was  about  to  say.  Mr.  P.  Jones  read  a  hymn  in  Chip- 
"  pewa,  w  iiich  the  Indians  san^  ;  then  1  said  a  short  prayer, 
"  selected  chietiy  from  one  of  the  baptismal  offices,  and  lectured 
"  on  the  t'o'lawiu'^  words,  *■  IJehold  1  brin&lt;&gt;' you  ^ood  tidings  of 
"  i^reat  joy,  which  shall  be  to  all  i)eoi)le.'  An  Indian  from  Cold- 
"  water,  with  wliom  I  was  ac(pniinted,  interpreted.  Thonj^h  liis 
"  knowledge  of  the  English  language  is  small,  he  seemed  to 
*'  understand  me  excei  dingly  well,  and  s])oke  with  great  energy 
"  and  iluency.  My  lecture  being  ended,  Mr.  Jones  rose,  and  in 
'•  a  very  pleasing  manner  addressed  the  Indians  in  their  own 
"  language,  and  concluded  with  a  brief  extempore  prayer  :  after 
"  which  a  hymn  was  sung. 

"On  the  day  following,  such  of  the  Heathen  Indians  as 
'*  were  disposed  to  accej)t  the  otter  of  civilization,  came  to  ac- 
"  quaint  me  with  their  intention  in  regard  to  religion.  I  was 
"  apprehensiv(&gt;  tluit  they  would  excuse  themselves,  by  saying 
"  that  they  shoidd  prefer  the  Iloman  Catholic  Church,  as  some 
•'.fHiemhad  told  me  privately  that  they  wished  to  embrace 
"  what  they  called  the  French  religion.  After  they  had  reclined 
"  in  silence  for  a  considerable  time,  an  old  Indian  rose,  and  a 
"  i)i[;e  l&gt;eing  lighted,  we  were  all  )-equested  to  smoke  with  him. 
"  Tlien  he  shook  liaiuls  with  us,  made  a  short  speech,  promised 
"  to  become  a  Christian,  and  attach  himself  and  all  his  family  to 
"  the  English  Cliurch.  Threeother  Indians  followed  his  example. 
"Then  the  cliief  of  a  tribe  (Aince  above  alluded  to)  consisting 
"of  about  seventy-five  persons,  said  that  they  would  return 
"  next  spring  and  settle  on  the  Manitoulin  Island,  but  that 
"they  would  not  pledge  themselves  at  present  to  become  members 
"of  the  Church.  He  assured  me,  however,  that  in  the  mean 
"time  I  need  have  no  apprehension  that  they  would  follow  any

spi-ml  the  remainder  of  the  day  on  a  very   Ktoriny  hea&lt;'h,  where 
our  tents  could    not  hi,'  conveniently  ereclt'd.     On  the  follow  in^f

liaviii;jf  reache&lt;l  La  Cloche,  we  went  to  see  a  cehdirated  souiidin&lt;^ 
rock,  from  which  the  Island  is  said  to  have&lt;leri\eU  its  appollation. 
It  is  situati'd  at  sonu*  distance  from  the   beach,  is  of  a  siindy 
nature,  ami  dilVers  not  in  api)i'arance  from  the  rocks  in  its\ivinity, 
hut  when  struck  withii  jnird  substance  it  sounds  like  iron.     The 
soundiu},^  rock   lies  on  a  circular   jdain   of  considerabU'  extent, 
wliieh  is  siirroumU'd  w  itli  pleasant  ^^roves  ;  the  surface  is  thinly 
covered  with  ;4;niss,  excejtt  on  Nome  parts  whicii  are  adorned  with 
beautiful   veiiluri',  and   tlecorated   by    blooinini,'  (diives,  oian^M;

pleasiiij&gt;'  prospects  whicli  it  commands  of  tiie  surroiindiiii^scem-ry, 
our  attention  was  suddenly  called  to  what  was  far  more  interesting 
to  nil!  than  any  tiling'  that  is  to  be  seen  at  La  Cloche.     .Several 
youni(  Indians  came  fioin  their  encampmi-nt,  which  was  not  far 
distant,  and  welcomed  us  with  evident  expressions  of  ])leasnro. 
llavimf  proeei'ded  to  their  lodjies  we   performed   lun-  morniii;^ 
devotions,  and  breakfasted  on  the  beautiful  j^rassy  jdainon  which 
they  were  erected.     Captain  Andei-son  conununicated  the  object

was  favourably  receiviMl  by  him  and  his  whole  tribe.    'I'iie  Indians, 
in  compliancewith  my  desire,  jx'imitted  the  women  and  children

become  Settlers  at   Manitoulin   Island.     The  weather  bi-inj*  ex-

Al'lJciiii,  of  the  I  loiioiiraldc  IIikIsoii  |{;iy  (Joiiipiiiiy,  which  is 
situated  on  tlit.'iiorthcrii  siiorc,  near  i  lie  jjlacc  whofc  \vc  cncampL'd, 
presents  a  very  neat  uiipearanee,  and  is  shcdtered  from  the  windn 
by  a  ran^e  of  hinh  rocUy  liills.  We  jtaid  Iiini  u  visit  on  the 
following'  inoniin;^',  and  were  received  with  luiich  civility  and 
kindness.  As  we  t'ontinned  onr  conrseanjonif  the  rocks,  Ave  .saw 
seviM'al  which  appeared  more  interesting^  to  us  than  any  we  hud 
seen  hefort  Some  of  them  lise  nearly  j)eri)endiciilar  nnh'e  than 
an  hiindre(l  feet  above  the  surface  of  the  lake,  while  others  of 
e(|ual  lieii.;ht  project  their  frownintf  clitVs  over  the  waters  which 
.surround  them,  and  reflect  thi'ir  dark  massy  forms.  We  broutrht 
our  canoe  close  under  one  ot  these  vast  overlian^'infi^  rocks,  wliich 
bein&lt;^  composed  of  ditferent  sultstaiiees,  ])i"esent  a  yreat  vai'ietv 
of  cohaii's.  At  ni^jht  our  tents  were  pitclied  on  a  fine  sandy 
boach  at  the  extremity  of  a  b)vely  bay.  On  the  mornin*^  of  the 
li.'ith  we  reacluMl  .NFessasau^in^' before  bre.ikfa&gt;t,  and  I  had  the 
l)leasure  of  preachin&lt;.&gt;'  to  about  fifty  Indians.  'Die  place  wliere 
they  assenjbled  is  a  sandy  ])lain,  and  tin;  .small  o'lks  and  other 
tre(vs,  with  which  it  is  thinly  coxered,  afforded  a  i^rateful  shade. 
On  that  occa-  ion  also,  the  women  and  cliildren  were  permitted  to 
attend  and  occupy  a  place  at  a  little  distance  from  tlie  men.  The 
whole  assembla&lt;^(i  foi'med  a  ciirleas  they  reclined  in  order  on 
the  lawn,  and  conducted  themselves  with  propriety,  but  notwith- 
standin;^  their  mild  and  docile  behaviour,  it  must  be  admitted 
that,  on  account  of  tiieir  iincleanlin(!ss  and  scanty  clothiuf^,  they 
have  a  disffusting  and  a  very  miserable  a])pi'arance ;  and  the 
tjontrast  between  the  Indians  in  their  wild  atul  savage  state  ainl 
those  who  have  in  any  degree  become  civilized  is  very  striking. 
The  Indians  at  Mossasauging  .seemed  j)leased  with  what  was  said 
to  them  ;  Misenence  their  chief,  made  no  objections,  but  said 
they  were  desirous  of  being  civilized  and  becoming  member.s  of 
the' Church. 

The  weather  was  extremely  hot  during  the  day,  and  in  the 
evening  we  encamped,  as  usual,  on  a  rock.  A  very  high  wind 
rose  in  the  night,  and  the  lake  being  greatly  agitated,  the  noise 
of  the  waves  as  they  broke  against  the  rocks  around  our  lonely 
dwelling  was  tremendous.  Notwithstanding  the  raging  of  the 
storm,  early  on  the  following  moi-ning  we  ventured  to  spread 
apart  of  our  sail  to  the  wind,  which  wafted  us  a  great  distance 
in  a  very  short  period. 

On  Saturday  the  27th,  we  arrived  at  the  Sault  St.  Marie, 
and  were  received  by  the  Rev.  Win.  M'Mnrray,  (the  Society's 
Missionary  there,  a]»i)ointed  in  October,  U}32,)  who  had  been 
anxiously  exj)e&lt;!ting  us  for  some  time,  with  great  kindness.  An 
assemblage  of  Indians,  belonging  to  his  congregation,  saluted 
and  welcomed  us  on  our  arrival  with  expressions  of  the  greatest 
joy,  and  with  the  most  iipparent  gratification.  During  the  short 
time  that  we  remained  there  1  had  tlu;  satisfaction  of  ])reaching 
several  times  to  the  Indians,  and  it  is  extremely  gratifying  to  wit- 
ness their  orderly  and  decent  behaviour  while  attending  divine 
service.  On  one  occasion,  immediately  after  the  sermon,  three 
Christian  couples,  who  had  been  married  according  to  Indian

On  Sunday  tlio  -JUli,  wo  adniinistcn-ed  tho  Holy  Conininnion 
to  thirty-fivo  persons,  most  of  wbom  liad  l)etii  baptized  and 
instructed  by  Mr.  M'Murray.  On  tluit  occasion  lie  read  a  j)art 
of  tlie  service  in  tlie  Chippewa  ton&lt;,'ue.  Mrs.  M'Murray,  who 
speaks  that  hmu^ua^e  very  tiucntly,  was  kind  enou;^fh  to  interpret 
a  pa»'t  of  my  diseourso  to  tlio  Indians  on  the  nature  and  desif^n 
of  the  Lord's  Supper.  She  has  taken  much  pains  in  teachinj' 
tliem  sacred  music,  and  their  sini^inf;'  is  a  very  affectinj^  and 
pleasing  part  of  thc'ir  worship.  The  con^avuation  consisted  of 
about  one  hundred  and  fifty  jjcrsons,  and  Mr.  M'Mnvray 
informed  me  that  the  nnml)er  of  Indians  receivinfr  relijjfious 
instruction  from  him  is  two  hundred  and  sixteen,  many  of  tliem, 
however,  are  yet  often  necessarily  absent  from  the  mission.  I 
have  peculiar  pleasure  in  beinj,'  able  to  state,  for  the  information 
of  the  Society,  that  Mr.  JM'Alurray's  missionary  labours  have 
been  attended  with  i^reat  success.  (The  Mission  at  Sanlt  St. 
Marie  was  opened  in  January,  1H32,  by  Mv.  Cameron,  fixed  there 
us  catochistaml  school  master — see  his  Letters  above,  and  the  To- 
ronto Kej).  of  18li2.)  In  strictly  examining;;  some  of  the  youn;^  In- 
dians in  tlie  presence  of  Captain  Anderson,  who  is  well  aciiuainted 
with  their  lan^nia^'e,  I  was  happy  to  find  they  have  made  rapid 
pro&lt;;^ress  in  the  ac(|uisition  of  Scriptural  knowledfi^e,  Avhich 
proves  the  assiduous  exertions  which  must  have  been  made  at 
the  Mission  &lt;br  their  instruction  and  improvement.  Cliingua- 
counse,  their  Chief,  made  use  of  several  expressions  in  a  speech 
wliich  lie  addressed  to  the  assembled  Indians  at  a  Council  which 
1  attended,  that  Avill  shew  more  clearly  than  any  observation 
which  I  am  able  to  make,  his  acquaintance  with  the  doctrines 
of  the  Gospel,  and  the  duties  of  the  Christian  life.  "  My  friends, 
"  said  he,  the  eye  of  the  Great  Spirit  is  npon  us,  now  that  we 
"  are  assembled  here  to&lt;&gt;ether.  It  is  the  will  of  that  Great 
"  lieing  that  we  should  receive  the  reli&lt;,non  which  he  hath  made 
"  knov.n  to  \is  in  his  Word.  For  our  sakes,  and  for  our  salvation, 
"  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  came  down  from  on  hipfli.  The  Lord  is 
"  merciful,  and  always  desirous  to  save  us.  Our  sins  were  a 
"■  heavy  burden,  and  it  was  needful  that  he  should  lay  down  his 
"  life  for  us.  lie  shed  his  blood  to  wash  away  our  sins  ;  without 
'■  this  we  should  be  wretched  here  on  eartii.  Let  us  consider 
"  this,  and  i-emember  that  miserable  bein&lt;&gt;s  as  we  are,  He  laid 
"  down  his  life  for  ns.  Now  my  friends,  this  is  what  our 
ministers  are  teachinj^  us,  that  we  must  look  for  the  salvation 
oi'our  souls  to  the  (rreat  God, — Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit." 
After  charoiny-  the  Indians  not  to  speak  evil  of  their  Clergyman, 
"le  added,  '•'■N'ow  my  friends,  let  ns  listen  attentively  to  our 
minister,  and  then  we  shall  be  enabled  to  love  one  another, 
oven  as  brothers  and  sisters  love  each  other.  My  friends,  we 
iiave  been  hearinir  ministers  of  different  denominations,  but 
let  us  not  on  that  account  be  strangers  to  one  another,  but 
good  friends.  Having  exhorted  his  Ijretlwen  to  overcome  the

"  Heaven  to  stren&lt;,'tlien  our  iniiula  that  we  may  have  power  to 
"  do  this."  llaviiif,^  before  interrupted  thetiiread  of  Mr.  Klliot's 
Journiil  to  ex])liiin  the  first  oriiriii  of  t\u\  Setth'uieiit  at  Maiii- 
touliii  Tsland,  it  may  now  he  interest inj,''  to  do  the  same  witii 
re^fard  to  tliis  Mission  at  Sault  St.  Marie,  taken  from  the  'J'oronto 
»So(!iety's  Report  tor  \iVA2,  {).  15.  The  ('ojnmitte(»,  says  the 
liei)ort,  are  painfully  aware  that  the  present  an-anj^ements  for 
Sault  8t  Marie,  are  mis(M'ahIy  incommensurate  with  its  necessities. 
Nor  are  they  surprised  to  tind  that  such  is  also  the  opinion  of  a 
great  fritMul  to  the  Indian  race,  and  an  ardent  supi)ort(&gt;r  of 
every  measure  fyr  their  conversion,  Governor  Sinij)son,  of  the 
Hon.  Hudson's  Hay  (yomjjany,  who,  in  a  letter  addressed  to 
the  IJisiiop  of  Quebec,  dated  Red  Hiver  Settlement,  writes  as 
follows  : — 

"  F,'l&gt;niar!/  Ut,  1832. 
"  The  only  field  I  now  see  open  itself  with  a  i)rospect  of 
'*  success  and  advantati^o  from  missionary  labours,  besides  Red 
"  Hiver,  is  tlie  Saidt  St.  ^[arie's,  which  connects  Lake  Huron 
"  with  Lake  Superior.  There  1  think  it  would  be  successful,  as 
"  the  country  in  the  ueii^ddKnirhood  of  that  place  has  become  so 
"  much  exhausti'd  in  fur-beariufij  animals,  that  the  natives  can 
"  no  Ioniser  inaiutain  themselves  by  the  ])rodnce  of  the  chase  ; 
"  so  that  very  little  encouraf&gt;-emeut  would  be  recpiired  to  induce 
"  tiiem  to  form  a  villa&lt;^e  at  that  spot,  and  the  lon&lt;^  intercoui'so 
"  they  have  had  with  the  whites,  now,  I  tliink,  prepares  them 
"  for  reliffious  instruction.  A  younj^  gentleman  of  tlie  name  of 
"  Cameron,  a  half-bred  native  of  the  country,  who  has  been  bred 
"  to  the  Church  in  Canada,  and  is,  I  understand,  zealous  even  to 
"  enthusiasm,  in  the  object  of  civilizing  and  converting  his 
"  countrymen,  has  lately  established  himscdf  thex*e  for  those 
"  ends  ;  but  the  pittance  he  is  paid  from  a  Society  in  York 
"  (now  Toronto,  viz.,  £100  per  annum  in  currency,  see  Report, 
"  1831)  is  very  inadequate,  as  that  sum  at  least  would  be 
"  necessary  for  charitable  purposes  alon(»  among  the  natives, 
"  till  they  got  into  the  way  of  raising  crops.  Another  £100 
"  would  be  necessary  to  cover  his  expences  in  moving  about 
"  from  camp  to  camp  in  the  neighbourhood  until  they  become 
"  settled,  and  his  own  la1)oiirs,  which  he  cannot  aiFord  to  bestow 
"  gratuitously,  as  his  means  are  very  slender,  would,  I  think,  be 
"  moderately  paid  at  another  £100  ;  so  that  a  Mission  there 
"cannot  be  expected  to  do  much  good,  unless  a  sum  of  about 
"  £300  can  be  procured  for  it.  I  mean  to  recommend  this 
"  Mission  to  the  Hudson's  Bay  Company,  but  as  the  situation  is 
'  beyond  the  limits  of  their  territory,  I  do  not  expect  they  will 
do  more  towards  its  support  than  offer  the  Clergyman  and  his 
assistants  board  and  lodging  at  their  Establishment  there  ; 
and  as  it  promises  to  be  productive  of  much  good  if  properly 
"  conducted  and  well  supported,  I  beg  leave  to  recommend  it 
"  to  your  Lordsliip's  sui)])ort  and  good  offices."  Mr.  ^M'Murray's 
salary  for  the  year  ending  August  20th,  1834,  was  £120,  with 
£37.  10s.  for  an  Intei'preter  :  but  it  does  not  appear  from  the 
Report  that  either  Governor  Simpson  or  the  Hon.  Hudson's

On  Tii'-'sday  tlu'  liOtli,  wo  ]»aid  a  visit  to  -Mr-.  Nonrso,  of  tho 
J  Ion.  Jlndson's  Hay  (.'on&gt;pany,  who  liappencd  not  to  be  at  lionit\ 
hut  Mrs.  Nonr.so  rtH'oiv'.rd  us  kindly,  and  wo  had  tho  plcasuro  of 
Slicing  him  tlici  followin^^  nioi-nintif.  On  Wednesday  Anly  1st, 
I  heard  Mr.  M'Murray  preach  to  the  Indians  in  an  inij  ressive 
nr.innor,  and  they  were  very  attentive  to  his  discourse. 

On  Thursday  tho  2nd,  we  U&gt;ft  the  Sault  .St.  Mai-ie,  and  Mr. 
Rol)crtson,  Chinsfuacounse,  and  other  Indians,  accompanied  u.s 
to  the  (Jarden  Jtivei-,  which  has  been  repi'oscnted  to  bo  a 
pn.'ferablo  site  for  the  Mission.  Jiut  so  far  as  I  am  able  to 
Judiie,  after  malcini;-  e!n[uiry  and  seeinj^-  both  places,  I  think  it 
would  be  inexpedient  to  chanj^o  the  situation  of  tho  estahlish- 
iMcnt.  The  land  at  (lard(Mi  kivi'r  is  not  supeiior  to  that  at  St. 
Mary,  and  the  Indians  j^cMierally  do  not  wish  to  reside  there. 
At  the  Sault  ♦^hen?  is  a  considei-abh;  portion  of  cultivated  land, 
but  at  (larden  iiiver  the  soil  is  all  covejrd  with  trees,  except  a 
few  acres.  At  the  ])resent  establishment  tlieri^  is  a  good  dwellin&lt;^ 
house,  •with  other  adjacent  buildings,  which  may  be  purchased 
at  a  lov/  ])rico,  wliilo  at  Garden  River  no  houses  have  yet  been 
Imilt,  and  Iniilding  is  extremely  expensive  in  that  remote  part 
of  the  country. 

On  Fi-iday  tho  ,Srd,  tho  weather  Ix'ing  fine,  we  proceeded  by 
Lake  Croorge  to  a  small  island  near  St.  .los(&gt;ph%:,  where  I  had  an 
opportunity  of  [)reachin;4'  to  a  band  of  Indians,  whoso  Clnef 
desired  mo,  wb.en  at  St.  Mary,  to  ])ay  them  a  visit.  They 
informed  nie  that  they  have  attached  tliemselvcs  to  the  Rev.  Mr. 
M'Murray's  Mission,  and  are  willing  to  become  Christians  ; 
and  I  trust,  that  with  tho  Divine  blessing  acconi))anying  tlie 
&gt;!i!'ans  which  may  be  used  for  their  conversion,  tliey  will  soon 
be  induced  to  icnounco  tho  fatal  habit  of  drinking  to  excess, 
the  grand  stumbling  ])Iock  which  at  i)resent  seems  to  prevent 
them  from  being  bi-onght  into  a  state  of  salvation. 

In  the  morning  of  the  following  day  we  visited  ^Major 
Ilaine's  new  Settlement  on  the  Island  of  St.  Josejih  ;  the  soil 
seems  to  be  excellent,  and  log  buildings  are  in  the  conr.se  of 
erection,  but  tiie  number  of  Settlers  is  yet  very  small.  Thence 
we  proceeded  to  Drummond  Island,  and  the  wind  being  very 
unfavourable,  w(i  were  obliged  to  pitch  our  tents  at  an  earlier 
hour  than  we  intended,  on  its  limestone  beach 

On  Sunday  the  5th,  having  performed  divine  service,  and 
the  wind  being  fair,  we  were  enabled  to  sail  to  the  great 
Manitoulin  Island. 

We  had  no  wish  to  leave  Drummond  Island  till  tlie  following 
morning,  but  our  particular  situation  and  circumstances  rendered 
it  necessary  to  proceed  on  that  occasion.  On  Monday  we 
(U)ntinued  our  course;  along  Viw.  noi'th  side  of  the  island,  bnt 
i:ould  not  proceed  far  on  account  of  a  strong  contrary   wind.

TTavin/?  roacliod  the  extroniity  of  alonp;  point,  vliorp  two  furious 
winds  met,  on  cucii  side  of  which  is  an  extensive  bay,  wo  wore 
tinder  the  nooessity  of  hindiuji^,  and  erected  our  tents  on  a  stonv 
boach.  Whihr  perfonninif  our  evenin;^  Avorsliip  we  w&lt;!re  visited 
Willi  a  heavy  shower  of  rain,  and  be«;,in  to  fear  that  our  situation 
wouhl  soon  become  very  uncoinforta])h',  but  the  rain  did  not 
continue  \onfr,  and  haviuif  sh'pt  soundly,  we  rose  on  the 
foUowinjL,'  nioruifii,'  eJieerful  and  haj)py,  to  continue  our  course. 
Thou&lt;i[h  the  wind  still  continued  hif.';h,  we  ventured  to  proceed  ; 
but  (Japt,  Anderson  and  I  were  ol)li&lt;^ed  to  walk  a  coTJsiderable 
distance  aloUL,^  tin;  beach  before  we  were  enal)l(&gt;d  to  embark. 
The  i^alo  increased  as  we  pursued  our  stormy  voyai^e  across  a 
spacious  bay,  but  the  wind  havin^if  (-hanjj^ed  and  liecomo  rather 
more  favourable,  wo  nnfoldcid  a  small  portion  of  the  sail,  and 
Avere  soon  wafted  many  miles  before  breakfast.  The  waves  rose 
to  an  alarniin'i;'  height,  but  our  liji^ht  birk  vessel,  beinij  skilfully 
conducted,  surmounteil  them  adminibly  well,  and  neitlier  our 
persons  nor  our  ])osessions  sustained  the  least  injury.  The 
Lake  haviuyf  ])e('om&lt;&gt;  extremely  au;itated,  we  landed  at  one  of 
tho  Hattlesnako  Islands,  and  remained  there  the  rest  of  the  day. 

The  ishmd  on  which  we  i)itched  our  tcMits,  and  others  in  its 
vicinity,  are  said  to  be  infested  with  rattlesnakes,  but  we  did 
not  see  any.  On  the  8th,  we  re-embarked  at  an  early  hour,  and 
the  wind  bein*^  fair,  wo  unfurled  all  our  sail,  and  proceeded  with 
^roac  raj)idity  aloufj  tho  northern  shore  of  the  ^ranitoulin 
Island,  We  breakfasted  at  a  place  called  j\lni)le  Point,  wIkm-c 
there  are  Indian  I'lantations  ;  but  boinj^-  at  some  distance  from 
the  boach,  and  havin^f  no  ^uide,  wo  were  unable  to  find  them. 
The  hind  there  api)ears  to  bo  sandy,  and  is  covered  with  a 
variety  of  trees,  and  tho  beach  is  adorned  with  beautiful  vines 
and  blooininiif  shrubs. 

On  another  j)art  of  the  island  wo  saw  a  well  cultivated  field, 
covered  with  Indian  corn,  on  tiie  toj)  of  a  j&gt;;en tie  eminence.  The 
soil  th  aigh  not  of  a  snpei-ior  kind,  bein&lt;r  easily  tilled,  seemed  to 
be  very  suitable  for  an  Indian  farm.  I'he  land  in  the  interior  of 
tho  island  is  said  to  be  excellent.  In  thoevoninn;  we  reached  the 
Indian  settlement  which  we  first  visited  on  our  arrival  iit  the 
island,  but  findinj^  that  all  the  Indians  had  proceeded  to  Pene- 
tanguishine  for  their  annual  presents,  we  made  as  little  delay  as 
possible,  and  hastened  our  return. 

On  Saturday  the  l!th,  we  met  a  considerable  number  of 
Ottawas  retm-ning  from  Penetanp^uishine,  who  informed  us  thai 
they,  with  many  others  of  their  nation,  are  desirous  to  become 
permanent  Settlers  on  the  Manitoulin  Island.  Late  in  the 
evening  we  arrived  at  a  rocky  ishmd.  about  twenty  miles  from 
Penetanguishine.  A  band  of  Indians  were  encam]»ed  on  the 
rocks,  and  wo  discovered  them  by  hearing  the  cries  of  some  of 
their  children.  When  wo  approached  them,  being  unable  to 
recognize  us  on  account  of  the  dai'kness  of  the  night,  they 
seemed  surprized  and  somewhat  alarmed,  but  our  Indians 
having  hoisted  a  flag  on  the  rocks,  their  fears  subsided,  and  they 
began  simultaneously  to  prepare  fuel  for  our  fire,  and  to  collect 
small  stones  for  pitching  our  tents.  Arrangements  being  made 
for  the  night,  we  had  some  conversation  with  the  "  barbarou-^

tercourse "  whewcd  ns  no  little  kindness."  'J'liey  infi&gt;nned  us 
that  thev  eanu*  from  Lake  Nippisiii;,'-,  and  were  about  to  proceed 
to  I'enetanf^uisbine  for  jn-esi'Mts  fiom  tlw'  government.  I'indin^' 
tliey  were  destitute^  of  food  we  j^ave  them  a  litth'  Indian  corn, 
which  thev  tliaidiftilly  r&lt;&gt;e(MV(Ml.  ()»i  tlie  fullitwin;,'  moininj;  I 
addressed  them  on  the  subject  of  relii^ion,  while  they  listened 
very  attentively. 

After  considerable  discussion  respcctini,'  riiristianity  and 
Civilization,  they  infoi'iiu'd  us,  tliat  sliould  ti-achi'i's  be  sent  to 
tlu'ir  country  they  would  become  members  of  the  Church.  A  few 
of  them  however,  have  ab-eady  attached  themselves  to  tlu&gt;  Koman 
Catholics.  It  is  probable,  that  if  an  establishment  should  be 
formed  at  Lake  Nii)])isin^',  the  Indians  in  tlie  interior  would  re- 
sort to  the  Mission,  whicli  wonld  eventually  lead  to  their  con- 
versioJi  and  reli'doiis  instruction.  A  younij  Indian  fj-om  those 
parts  repeated  to  Capt.  Anderson  a  lamentable  fact,  which  thi 
latter  has  fieiiuently  stated  to  me,  that  instances  have  occurred 
of  the  natives  of  those  distant  solitudes  beiny-  /guilty  of  the  horrid 
crime  of  killing'  their  nearest  relations,  and  afterwards  feasting' 
on  their  lifeless  remains.  Tiiis  rej)ort  is  corroborated  by  Indians 
residin&lt;,f  at  Sault  St.  Marie,  and  attested  by  some  of  tlie  gentle- 
uiou  of  the  Honourable  Hudson's  I5ay  Company. 

llavinj^  returned  to  Penetannuishine  on  the  llJth,  I  had  the 
pleasure  early  on  the  followinj^  nutrnin,'^  of  jtreachiii;^'  to  above 
ei&lt;,dit  hundred  Indians,  as  they  sat  on  the  ground  at  the  military 
establishment.  On  that  occasion  I  recojrnized  many  persons 
wlioni  I  had  previously  addressed  in  their  native  wilds,  who  re- 
peated their  assurances  that  they  will  attend  to  instruction,  and 
attach  themselves  to  the  Church.  The  number  of  Indians  who 
accei)ted  my  offers  is  three  ha iiflird  and  g'latij  nine,  and  two  hundred 
and  sixty  six  of  them  have  exjjressed  their  determination  to  settle 
at  the  Manitoulin  Island.  IJiit  there  are  many  other  Indian.s 
with  whom  I  have  had  intercourse,  and  multitudes  with  whom 
no  opj)ortunities  of  communication  have  yet  been  afforded,  who, 
f  am  persuaded,  mi^iit  easily  be  induced  to  avail  themselves  of 
the  blessings  of  Christianity. 

The  more  that  is  seen  and  heard  of  these  wretched,  b\it  in- 
teresting wanderers  of  the  wilderness,  the  more  solicitude  is  felt 
for  their  speedy  admission  into  the  Hock  of  Christ  ;  and  the 
thought  ought  not  to  be  entertained,  that  any  Churchman,  who 
is  under  the  influence  of  the  benevolent  spirit  of  our  religion,  can 
vithhoki  his  aid  in  rescuing  those  from  destruction,  for  whcjm,  as 
dl  as  for  himself,  the  Eedeemer  died.  At  a  loss  to  account  for 
the  diversity-  of  pjirties  and  persuasions  into  which  the  Christian 
world  is  unhappily  divided,  and  perplexed  by  the  various  views 
in  which  religion  is  presented  to  them,  but  desirous  to  be  par- 
takers of  the  blessings  we  enjoy,  these  simple  sojourners  (if  the 
rocks  are  calling  upon  us  to  shew  them  "  the  way  of  salvation." 

I  need  scarcely  recommend  them  to  the  charitable  considera- 
tion of  the  committee,  and  I  hope  that  some  effective  plan  may 
bo  soon  devised  for  the  promotion  and  accomplishment  of  one 
leading  object  of  the  society—  the  Conversicn  and  Civilization  of 
the  Indians  by  the  agency  of  the  Church.

em}»loyod  sinc(»  my  arrival  a&lt;2;ain  at  tho  Kmi&lt;;rant  Sottlomont. 

On  Wednesday  .Tuly  lotli,  I  returned  to  (.oldwator,  and 
road  prayors  and  in'oaehod  tlioro  on  tho  following'  Sunday 
to  a  fow  pooplo  at  tho  houso  of  ('apt.  Anderson.  Thenco  I 
procooded  on  tho  23rd  to  tho  townsiiip  of  Mos,  and  visited  a 
sick  person  in  that  noitifhbourhood  the  next  mornin&lt;;,  wlio  died 
soon  after.  I  won  ha])py  to  find  his  conversation  on  religious 
subjects  satisfactoiy,  and  his  opinions  Scriptural,  and  it  M'as 
aflPocting  to  hoar  him  solemnly  declare  before  those  who  were 
present,  that  he  looked  for  salvation  only  through  the  merits 
and  mercy  of  Jesus  Christ.  I  reminded  him  of  the  necessity 
of  a  renewal  of  heart  by  tho  influence  of  the  Holy  Spirit, 
in  order  to  be  made  moot  to  be  partakers  of  the  inheritance 
of  the  Saints  in  light,  and  endeavoured  to  encom-age  him 
to  pray.  Afterwards  I  road  to  liim  some  of  tho  prayors  in  the 
office  for  tlie  visitation  of  the  sick,  in  which  he  appeared  heartily 
and  devontly  to  join. 

On  Sunday  the  26th,  I  read  prayers  and  proacliod  in  Me- 
donte  and  Vesj)ra  to  very  attentive  assemblages  of  ])oople.  As 
I  journeyed  the  next  day  to  IJarrie,  in  the  latter  township,  1 
had  the  pleasure  of  inspecting  the  neat  frame  Church  formerly 
mentioned  as  building  under  the  superintendence  of  Captain 
O'Brien,  and  which  I  have  been  since  informed  is  now  finished. 
The  site  is  admirable,  being  on  the  side  of  a  hill,  which  rises 
gradually  from  the  beach,  and  commanding  a  pleasing  prospect 
of  Kemponfoldt  Bay,  and  the  vast  surrounding  woods.  In 
passing  through  Innisfil  on  the  27th,  I  was  prevented  from 
proceeding  so  far  as  I  wished  by  lioavy  showers  of  rain,  but  had 
an  opportunity  of  addressing  a  few  persons  at  tho  house  whore 
I  lodged,  on  the  subject  of  religion.  The  next  day  I  reached 
Tecumseth,  and  i)reaclied  at  a  small  school  house  on  the  evening 
of  the  31st.     There  were  about  thirty  persons  present. 

On  Sunday  August  2nd,  I  had  the  pleasure  of  performing 
divine  service  and  preaching  in  tlie  new  Church  which  has  been 
lately  erected  in  the  township  of  Tecumseth.  Much  work  yet 
remains  to  be  done  before  it  be  completeu.     About  two  hundred 

feople  attended,  and  six  children  were  baptized.  In  the  afternoon 
rode  seven  miles,  and  read  prayers  and  preached  in  West 
Gwillimbury,  after  which  I  baptized  a  child.  The  franie  of  a 
Church  has  at  length  been  raised  in  that  township.  The  next 
day  I  arrived  in  Toronto,  and  proceeded  thence  on  the  Friday 
following  to  Scarborough.  Previous  information  being  as  widely 
circulated  as  so  short  a  period  would  permit,  1  otficiated  twit-e

in  that  towualiij)  on  Suiulny  tlu»  fUli  to  n  numerous  and  attentive 
conoourHO  ofpcuplo,  and  baptized  Imir  children.  On  the  evening 
of  the  foHowin^f  (hiy  I  ai^ain  perfurnied  divine  service  at  tlie  same 
phice,  and  tlie  conyrepation  Mas  also  !iir;^('  on  that  occasion. 
'J'he  ne.xt  Sunday  after,  about  two  hundred  peoj)le  attended 
divine  service,  and  twelve  receivi'd  the  Holy  Conmiunion.  On 
Monday  the  17th  I  ivturned  to  Toronto,  and  pidcei'di'd  thenco 
apiiii  on  tlie  22(1  to  the  township  of  J'icUerin;,'',  and  on  Sunday  tho 
2Jh"d  I  olHciatcd  in  Whitby,  the  adjoininj^  township,  to  a  very 
attentive  cmiurt'^,  .ion  of  about  two  hundred  persons.  Having 
then  tra\  filed  to  the  rear  Settlements  of  l*ickerinj&gt;-,  I  visited  sonio 
of  the  nuMnbei'sof  tlu Church,  andnuide  an  appointment  topreach 
in  tliat  nei^hhrjui'hood.  In  riie  eveiiin;^ of  t'le  followini^  day  I 
e.\])laiued  a  poition  of  Scripture  to  a  few  persons  in  the  seventh 
concession  of  Whitby,  and  on  my  return  to  l'ickerin&lt;f,  I  read 
prayei's,  j)reachi'd,  and  lectured  on  the  liturgy  to  about  thirty 
people.  On  Saturday  the  'J!)tli,  1  ])r()ceede(l  to  the  township  of 
J)arUu&lt;iton,  and  was  lather  disai)pointed  on  my  arrival  to  find 
that  iu)tice  of  my  intention  to  iierform  divine  service  had  not 
been  so  ;;eneially  i^iven  as  I  expected.  1  oftici.ited  twice  on  tlie 
following  day  at  JJowmanvilie,  and  J)!ii)ti/ed  a  child  ;  and 
though  tlu'  weather  was  wet  and  disa^^reeable,  it  did  not  prevent 
a  considerable  concourse  of  jjcople  from  assembling  on  the 
occasion.  'J'he  weatlier  becoming  more  favourable  the  next 
morning,  I  was  enabled  to  visit  some  of  the  members  of  the 
Church,  and  also  to  inspect  two  new  Churclies  which  have  been 


lateb 


Jateiy  erected  m  that  neiglu  ourliood,  but  at  that  time  tliey  were 
very  far  from  being  comj)leted.  'J'hey  are  both  frame  buildings  ; 
the  one  which  the  inhabitants  of  Darlington  have  raised  stands 
at  the  village  of  Bowmanville,  and  the  other,  which  Mr.  Wilmot 
is  building,  is  situated  in  the  township  of  Clarke,  near  the  line 
between  it  and  Darlington.  The  sites  of  both  Churches  are 
excellent,  and  only  about  four  miles  apart. 

On  Tuesday  Sept.  1st,  I  proceeded  again  to  the  seventh 
concession  of  Whitby,  to  baptize  a  child.  'J'he  next  morning  I 
visited  a  family  of  Episcopalians  as  they  were  reajjing  in  a  field, 
and  had  some  very  interesting,  and  I  trust  edifying  conversation 
with  them  concerning  Christ  and  his  Church.  I  was  also 
favoured  in  the  evening  with  an  o])portnnity  of  lecturing 
on  a  passage  of  scripture  for  the  information  of  a  few  very 
attentive  i)eople.  On  the  4th  I  read  prayers  and  preached  at 
nio;ht  in  a  school  on  the  eighth  concession  of  the  same  township, 
about  forty  persons  being  present.  In  the  evening  of  the  5th 
having  reached  the  sixth  concession,  I  officiated  ana  preached  to 
about  thirty  peo])le. 

On  the  morning  of  Sunday  the  6th  I  performed  divine  service 
iu  the  most  central  part  of  the  township — a  very  large  congrega- 
tion Avas  expected  to  assemble,  but  heavy  and  incessant  rain  pre- 
vented many  from  attending.  A  considerable  number  however 
were  present,  and  five  members  of  the  Church  received  the  Holy 
Communion.  The  Episcopalians  in  that  neighbourhood  are 
erecting  a  log  building  to  assemble  in  for  the  purposes  of  divine 
service.  In  the  evening  of  the  same  day,  having  previously  made 
an  engagement  to  do  so,  I  preached  in  the  sixth  concession  of

On  my  arrival  a  i)i«uis  and  friondly  yonn/jj  man  immediately  fjave 
notice  to  tli(!  jx'oplo  in  the  nei;^hhoiirliood,  and  a  c&lt;)n.si&lt;h&gt;ral&gt;h&gt; 
ct)n^M-oi&gt;;atiun  of  J'.pi.scopalians  met  at  the  iiouse  of  ^Ir.  liittio,  to 
whom  after  rcadinj,^  the;  ])rayers  and  rnaliin},' some  oltservations 
on  the  litni-^fy,  I  preached  on  jnstitication  by  faith  in  JesiiH 
(Jhrist.  On  ]Slon(hiy  tlu^  7th,  h(*in^  desired,  J  rode  several  miles 
in  the  moviiiii;,'  to  visit  a  sick  person,  to  whom,  with  threo 
otliers,  I  a(lministere(l  the  Floly  Communion. 

The  next  day  I  jjroeeeded  a_nain  to  S('arl)oronf&gt;-h,  where  I 
oxplained  a  portion  of  Scri})tnre  to  a  few  persons  in  the  evenings, 
and  on  tlx;  following'  day  I  passed  throii^Ii  tlie  townships  of 
Yoi-lv  and  Mtobicoke  to  tiie  Goi-e  of  'J'oi'onto,  tiience  I  continued 
my  journey  the  next  day  to  the  second  concession  of  the  town- 
sliip  of  Toronto. 

On  the  evening'  of  Friday  tlio  11th,  I  read  ])rayerf»,  preaclied, 
and  baptized  nine  children  in  that  nei'^dibourhood,  about  eijrhty 
persons  were  pi-esiMit.  The  next  day,  accomj)anied  by  Mr. 
Aikin.s,  I  returned  to  the  (ioni  of  Toronto  thi'ou^h  a  very  iieavy 
rain,  on  account  of  wliich  tlic  people  could  not  meet  in  the 
evenin/;,''  for  divine  service,  as  they  intended.  A  fc^w  jiersons 
however  assembled  at  the  house  where  I  lodj^ed,  to  whom  ] 
addressed  a  short  lecture.  Though  the  weather  was  cloudy  and 
disagreeable  on  the  uu)rning  of  Sunday  the  1,'Jtli,  the  little  lo;,'' 
house  was  filled  wit);  attentive  i)eople.  Having  re  id  jirayer.s 
and  preached  to  them  in  the  afternoon,  I  rode  about  five  mile.s 
over  a  very  wet  road,  and  read  ])rayers  and  ]&gt;reached  to  a  very 
numerous  and  devout  assembhige  of  Episcopalians.  U])on  that 
occasion  I  was  reijuested  to  baptize  a  child,  who  had  been 
cariied  by  her  parents  many  miles  walking  on  foot  through  the 
woods.  The  next  morning  1  rode  a  considerable  distance,  and 
administei'cd  the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Su]Ji)er  to  a  pious 
member  of  the  Church,  then  confined  to  his  room,  and  two 
othei"  persons  communicated  with  him. 

On  Tuesday  the  loth,  1  retiirned  to  ToroJito  and  visited  the 
JJishop,and  preached  in  the  evening  of  the  17th  to  a  very  attentive 
congregation  at  a  house  in  Etobicoke,  remote  from  Dr.  Phillip's 
(.^hurches  in  that  township.  The  following  Sunday  the  weather 
was  very  unfavourable,  bnt  did  not  hinder  above  a  hundred 
l)eople  assembling  at  the  Gore  of  Toronto.  On  tli.at  occasion  1 
baptized  two  children  and  administered  the  Holy  Communion 
to  twenty  three  ])ortfons.  In  the  afternoon  I  rode  several  miles, 
and  four  members  of  the  Church  were  kind  enough  to  accoin- 
])any  mo.  Tliough  co])ious  showers  of  rain  fell  almost  inces- 
santly during  the  day,  which  rendered  the  travelling  very  uii- 
(lomfortable,  I  found  a  respectable  assemblage  of  people  on  ar- 
I'iving  at  the  appointed  place  of  meeting,  to  whom  having  read 
the  i)rayers  I  i)reacliod,  and  afterwards  baptized  a  child.  In  tho 
evening  of  the  2Jird,  I  again  ofliciated  in  the  same  neighbour- 
hood, and  about  sixty  })eople  attended. 

On  the  24th  and  2r)th  I  proceeded  through  Chinguacousy  and 
Calodon  to  the  townsiiip  of  Mono,  and  found  travelling  become 
exceedingly  disagreeable,  on  account  of  the  extreme  coldness  of

arrival  1  visited  some  of  the  members  of  the  Cluireh  in  Mono, 
and  auion^  them  a  sick  jierson  witii  wliom  I  eonversed  and 
prayed.  A  wet  moniinuf  prevented  many  i)er.sonH  from  attend- 
in^'divine  .si'r\  ice  on  Suiithiy  the  27th,  but  a  eonsiderable  eon- 
'&gt;-re;,'ati()n  as.sembled  in  tlie  ni«w  C'hiiiTli,  which  is  yet  so  open 
und  inconiph'te,  tliat  it  afforded  ns  but  a  ])oor  sheher  from  the 
cold  wind  and  rain  ;  n()twithstan&lt;lin^'  tliesc  discoui-aj^inj,'  eircum- 
htance.s,  ei|^ht  ciiildren  were  picscnted  for  baptism. 

Early  on  tiio  folhjwin&lt;i;  morninjjf,  accompanied  by  Mr. 
^['^riiiini.s,  a  member  of  the  Church,  1  i)rocee(UMl  in  a  northern 
direction,  about  tiiirteen  mih's,  to  tlie  township  of  Mnlmur. 
The  roii;^'hness  of  the  n»ad,  a  sharp  north  wind,  and  occasional 
showers  of  sh'et,  rendered  our  journey  very  unph'asant.  These 
thin^^s,  however,  did  not  hinder  a  crowd  of  Ki)iscopalians  meet- 
iu;;-  at  the  house  of  Mr.  LittU*,  and  sixteen  cliihlren  were  bap- 
tized. On  that  occasion  tliere  were  persons  present  from  many 
(hlferent  townships.  In  that  part  of  the  country  1  heard  a  very 
favourable  report  of  a  Mr.  iJromley,  from  Enj^land,  who  occa- 
sionally read  prayers  in  Mulmur  and  otiier  adjacent  townships 
dui'inif  the  summer  months.  I  have  not  the  honour  of  bein;^ 
acipiainted  witli  liim,  but  several  jjcrsons  informed  me  that  he 
ffave  very  valuable  instruction  and  advice  to  the  people,  and 
especially  to  the  Episco]ialians.  After  the  services  of  the  day 
were  performed,  I  visited  an  Indian  encampment  in  the  woods, 
not  far  from  the  place  where  1  preached.  The  inmates  were  not 
destitute  of  food,  but  they  were  altogether  ignorant  of  Chris- 
tianity, and  miserable  in  a  moral  point  of  view.  I  had  very 
little  conversation  with  them  as  no  interpreter  could  be 
found,  but  had  no  sooner  entered  their  lodge  than  even  the 
ciiildren  recognized  me  with  evident  expressions  of  pleasure,  as 
the  minister  who  met  them  and  preached  to  them  at  Tenetau- 
guishine. 

On  the  following  morning  every  thing  wore  a  wintry,  but  an 
interesting  asjiect.  The  ground  was  covered  with  snow,  and  the 
variegated  woods,  not  yet  cpiite  stripped  of  their  sjimmer  leaves, 
could  scarcely  sustain  the  white  load  which  had  fallen  upon  them 
during  tlie  night.  Having  now  returned  to  Mono,  I  again  olfi- 
ciated  and  preached  in  the  new  Church  on  the  30tli  to  a  few 
people,  and  two  children  were  baptized. 

Toivmhip  of  Toronto^  Nor.  2nd,  1835. 

What  I  have  now  to  communicate  forms  the  conclusion  of 
the  simple  statement  of  my  proceedings,  which  has  been  regularly 
transmitted  during  a  i)eriod  of  about  three  years,  which  I  have 
had  the  honour  to  em])loy  in  the  society's  service. 

Travelling  in  the  woods  has  lately  become  exceeding  diffi- 
cult and  disagreeable,  owing  to  the  rainy  weather  and  the  bad- 
ness of  the  roads.  I  feel  no  disjiosition,  however,  to  complain, 
but  rather  to  be  tinmkful  to  the  giver  of  all  good  for  the  conti- 
nuation of  my  health,  and  for  being  enabled  to  attend  to  the 
duties  of  my  office.  I  have  been  greatly  cheered  and  encouraged 
by  the  cor(liial  kindness  and  assistance  which  I  have  received 
from  the  Settlers,  even  in  the  remotest  and  wildest  regions  of 
the  wilderness  which  I  have  visited.

extremely  uneonifortalde  in  cold  and  Ntorniy  weath»'r. 

On  Thursday  Oet.  Ist,  I  rode  a  considerable  distance  under 
n  very  heavy  rain,  and  oHieiated  at  tlu'  house  of  Airs.  Carson,  in 
the  township  of  Mono,  who  is  a  pious  ini-nilier  of  the  ('iiuich, 
and  hiis  bei'u  confined  above  ji  year  to  her  bed  l)y  sickn&lt;fss. 
Notwithstandinuf  the  rain,  tlu;  little  lo;,^  barn  was  soon  lilh'd  w  ith 
th(!  nei;;]d&gt;onrs  of  tin;  sick  person,  and  nine  of  them  received  tlur 
iloly  Communi(jn  with  her.  1  also  read  tlie  prayers  and 
j)reaehed  on  that  occasion.  In  the;  evening'  1  ])roceeded  to  Mr. 
Ketehum's  in  the  said  lownshii),  unil  read  |»rayers  and  preaeluid 
on  the  followiiii;  day  to  twenty  people,  ilere  bein/;'  particularly 
requested,  1  administered  the  iSacranient  of  the  l^iord's  Supper 
to  three  persons,  and  two  children  weiv  baptized.  Mi'.  Ivet- 
elumi's  exi;rtions  in  jironuitin;^  the  relij^ious  instruction  of  the 
youn&lt;4'  in  the  renu)te  settlements  where  lie  resides,  are  hi&lt;&gt;hly 
&lt;N)!nmendable.  lie  has  formed  several  Sunday  Schools,  and 
instructed  above  a  hundrt'd  i)ersons  in  the  Church  catechism. 
Nor  are  his  benevolent  effort.s  confined  to  llie  Kjiiscopalians,  to 
whom  he  is  more  partJcularly  attached,  but  he  ^^ives  reli&lt;)iouH 
information,  and  nuikes  ])resentH  of  the  best  of  books  to  all  denij- 
niinations  within  his  reach. 

On  Sunday  the  4th,  I  proceeded  to  CaU'don,  over  a  very 
swani])y  road,  and  1  found  a  lartje  and  attentive  crowd  of 
(•liur(rh-})eoi)Io  assembled  in  a  barn.  1  ivad  prayers,  nuule  ob- 
servations on  the  litur;4y,  and  preached  to  them,  after  which 
ei^Iit  children  were  baptized,  and  seventeen  pcr.sons  received 
the  Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper.  Motwithstandin^  our  un- 
&lt;M)mfortable  circumstances,  tiiese  solemn  services  were  attended 
to  by  the  con&lt;;re^ation  with  much  seeminir  seriousness  and  devo- 
tion, and  1  trust  not  without  the  divine  blessing-.  I  returned  in 
the  evening-  to  Mono,  and  proceeded  thence  on  Wednesday  tlie 
7th  to  Albion,  visited  some  of  the  inhabitants,  and  addressed  a 
short  reIi&lt;,Mous  lecture  to  a  few  people  who  assembled  in  tlie 
eveuinir.  Notice  having-  been  widely  circulated,  a  numerous 
congregation  was  j^atliered  together  on  JMr.  Sterne's  "  thrasliin;: 
floor"  on  Sunday  the  11th,  to  whom  1  read  prayer.s,  lectured  on 
the  Lord's  Sui)i)cr,  preached  on  Salvation  by  Grace,  and  adnii- 
iiisteied  the  Holy  Sacrament  of  liaptism  to  six  peisons. 

The  next  day  1  had  considerable  difficulty  in  i)roceedinj,' 
from  Albion  to  tho  township  of  Tecumseth  through  the  woods, 
on  account  of  the  roughness,  wetness,  and  obscurity  of  the  road  ; 
but  the  same  observation  may  be  made  with  respect  to  munv 
others  of  the  new  settlements  through  which  I  had  to  travel. 
Having  remained  a  few  days  in  Tecumseth,  and  preached  thrice 
in  that  township,  and  once  in  West  Gwillimbury,  the  townsliij) 
adjoining,  1  returned  again  to  Albion.  Oji  Saturday  the  'J.'hd, 
1  visited  a  sick  person  in  that  neighbourhood,  to  whom,  with 
three  others,  I  administered  the  Holy  Communion. 

On  the  following  day,  which  waf:;  Sunday,  Ii)erformed  divine

Khould  deem  it  expedient  to  m)minat(!  the  Ren-.  Adam  J^lliot  to 
the  Indian  establishment  at  the  (ireat  Manitoulin  Island  (an 
account  of  which  has  been  previously  {riven  inthiscorre.-'i&gt;ondenco,) 
llis  Excellency  would  take  inunediate  measures  for  "gathering

interijst  taken  hy  the  piihlic  in  their  successful  prosecution.  'I'ho 
zeal  and  activitv  of  the  two  missionaii(&gt;s  eiiiployj'd  hv  tho 
Nocicty  have  overcome,  under  the  divine  hh'ssiiii;,  most  of  tho 
ditHciilties  wliii'h  their  respective  spheri's  of  ex&lt;'rtion  at  first  pre- 
sented, as  will  appear  from  n  perusal  of  the  subjoined  accounts  of 
their  proceediiii;s,  to  which  particular  attention  is  invited. 
Kvery  additional  impulses  to  a  movement  anspi(Mously  Ix'^iin  in 
of  essential  s&lt;'rvice  in  all  cas(»s,  and  will,  it  is  hoped,  he  oppor- 
tunely ^'iveii  in  this  instance  to  can-y  forward  the  lahonrs  of  tho 
society  amon^r  the  Indians  at  the  Sault  JSt.  Mai-ie,  and  the  desti- 
tute !S(;ttlers  and  Indians  of  the  Jlonu;  J)istrict,  and  other  dis- 
tricts of  tlu&gt;  I'roviiice  ^'cnerally.  Of  these  two  classes  of  persona 
the  Committee  are  at  a  loss  to  say  which  jirefers  tho  stroni^est 
chtims  to  consideration  ;  they  earnestly  recommend  the  roliirious 
destitution  of  hoth  to  the  sympathy  of  the  Christian  community. 
I'erhaps  the  mot'ves  to  Christian  henevolenco  were  never  hotter 
un(l(&gt;rstood,  and  never  more  widely  acted  upoti  than  at  the  pre- 
sent moment  ;  hut  the  Committee  are  so  forcibly  struck  by  tho 
following  view  of  tho  remarkable  revolution  that  has  been 
offected  within  the  last  thirty  yeai's,  in  th(&gt;  sentiments  of  Chris- 
tians on  the  subject  of  diffusing  their  religion,  that  they  venture 
to  introduce  it  here  : — 

''  'J'he  founder  of  Christianity  left  Avith  his  disciples  tho 
unlimited  injunction  to  go  forth  into  all  the  world,  and  topn'aeh 
the  gospel  to  every  creature."*  This  command,  corroborated  hy 
others  of  e([uivalent  imjtoi't,  and  enforced  by  the  very  nature  of 
the  Christian  doctrine,  and  by  the  spirit  of  Christian  charity,  \9 
now  understood  and  acknowledged  in  a  manner  that  is  new  to 
the  Church,  to  be  of  universal  -bligation  :  so  that  no  Christian, 
how  obscure  soever  may  be  i.is  station,  or  small  his  talents,  or 
limited  his  means,  can  be  held  to  bo  altogether  excused  fror- 
the  duty  of  fulfilling,  in  some  way,  the  last  mandate  of  his  Lord. 
Thus  understood,  tliis  conunand  makes  crrn/  Witrcr  a  i)reucher 
and  a  missionary,  or  at  least  obliges  him  to  see  to  it,  so  far  as  his 
ability  extends,  that  the  labours  of  diffusive  evangelization  are 
actually  performed  (&gt;i/  a  guhstiliitc. 

"  Before  the  commencement  of  the  recent  missionary  efforts, 
there  had  been  missions  to  the  Heathen  ;  but  these,  it  carried 
on  with  any  thing  more  than  a  perfunctionary  assiduity,  wero 
anomalous  to  tho  general  feeling  of  Christians,  and  rested  uu

the  oxein;)lary  zeal  of  individuals.  But  the  modern  missions 
are  niaiiitiiincd,  neither  by  the  zeal  of  the  few,  nor  by  the  mere 
zeal  of  the  many  ;  but  rather  by  tlie  deep-seated  impulsive  power 
of  a  1,'rave  and  irresistible  conviction,  (pressinj;  on  the  conscience 
even  of  the  inert,  and  the  selfish,  and  much  more  on  the  hearts 
of  the  fervent  and  devoti'd  :)  tiuit  a  Christian  has  no  more  liberty 
to  withhold  his  aid  and  service  from  these  evan^reliziny  associa- 
tions, than  he  has  to  abandon  the  duties  of  common  life  ;  and 
that  for  a  man  to  profess  hope  in  Christ,  and  to  deny  what  he 
mi^lit  sjjare  to  ])i"om.,  the  diiiiisien  of  the  /^-ospel,  is  the  most 
egre,i,Moi!s  of  all  practical  solecisms."*  ^ 

The  Committee  j)roceeil  to  submit  .a  concise  statement  of 
what  has  been  doin/^-  at  the  Sault  8t.  M.irie,  durinj^  the  past  year, 
collected  from  the  corres{)on(lenc(!  of  the  liev.  Wm.  M'JNIurray  : 

Dkckmheh  14,  \\j,V,S. — Mr.  M'Murray  writes  the  Committee, 
that  owiiii,'  to  the  prevalence  of  the  measles  among  the  Indians, 
he  hiid  been  unable  to  oj)en  his  school  till  the  beginning  of 
November,  a  d  that  the  attendance  then  given  was  but  thin. 
He  complains  of  the  childi-en  being  too  often  and  too  long  sepa- 
rated from  him,  to  retain  any  serious  impressions  which  may 
have  been  made  upon  them  ;  but  anticipates  the  removal  of  this 
evil  by  the  domestication  of  their  parents,  which  is  now  in  pro- 
gress. He  received  at  this  time  two  invitations  from  numerous 
bodies  of  Indians  at  the  Michipicoton  and  Pic,  two  posts  of  the 
Hon.  Iludso'i's  Bay  Company,  the  first  distant  about  140,  the 
second  about  240  miles  from  the  iSault  St.  Marie,  both  on  Lake 
Superior,  Two  Indian  youths,  one  the  son  of  a  chief,  applied  to 
him  to  be  sent  in  the  spring  to  each  of  the  above-mentioned 
places.  Mr.  M'Murray  thinks  they  might,  if  indulged  in  their 
wish,  be  the  means  of  doing  much  good,  and  opening  the  way 
for  some  more  useful  person  hereafter.  In  this  letter  he  adds, 
"  many  of  the  Indians,  both  old  and  young,  are  beginning  to 
think  very  seriously  of  religion,"  and  announces  that  the  prin- 
cipal chief,  together  Avith  two  of  his  daughters,  had  actually 
abandoned  idolatry  ;  seven  persons  had  received  baptism  at  his 
hands,  more,  indeed,  had  offered  themselves,  but  before  admit- 
ting them,  the  missionary  took  time  to  ascertain  the  soundness 
and  sincerity  of  their  belief.  "  Our  meetings  have  been  very 
regularly  and  numerously  attended, — two  take  place  every  Sab- 
bath, and  one  on  Thursday.  JSIrs.  M'Murray  assembles  the 
females  on  Friday  evening,  when  singing  is  attended  to,  as  part 
of  their  religious  instruction." 

The  scholars  in  attendance  are  stated  to  be  from  twenty  to 
twenty-five,  not  half  the  number  that  attend  in  summer  :  their 
improvement  is  rapid  ;  but  the  Missionary  com^/lains  that  his 
attention  to  the  business  of  the  school  interfei*es  with  mo.e  im- 
portant duties.  A  translation  into  Chippewa,  of  the  catechism 
and  part  of  the  common  prayer  of  the  Church,  completed  by 
himself,  and  printed  by  direction  of  the  committee,  has  been 
forwarded  to  him  for  the  use  of  the  scholars  and  the  Mission 
generally.

aiul  contrasted  the  pious,  sober  manner  in  wliich  the  Christian 
converts  at  the  Haiilt  spent  the  first  (hiy  of  th(?  New  Year,  with 
the  riotous  intoxication  of  the  rest.  The  state  of  these  hist  he 
represents  to  b(?  truly  pitial)h'. 

FEHRi'Auy  4. — Mr.  M 'Murray  announces  tlte  baptism  of 
fenn  individuals  belonoini,''  to  the  family  of  tne  chief  of  tlu»i)liice, 
"  who  had  all  ^iven  sufticient  evidence  of  preparation."  The 
school  was  lu'okcn  u])  by  the  suj];ar  season.  In  this  h&gt;tter  ho 
writes  : — "The  old  chief  is  a  sincere  convert  ;  the  traders  on  the 
opposite  side  have  endeavoured  to  seduce  him  to  driidc.  On  one 
occasion  he  told  them, — '  When  I  wanted  it,  you  Avould  not  j^ive 
it  me— now  I  do  not  want  it,  you  try  to  force  it  ui)on  me  ;  drink 
it  youj'selves.' "  Kefornuitiou  in  this  resjjcct  is  not  v^'onfined  to 
the  chief.  He  subjoins — ''My  room  is  tilled  with  Indians  who 
are  taking  their  leave  of  jue  to  go  to  their  hunting  giounds.  I 
wish  you  could  see  them  ;  yov.  would  be  pleased  with  the  great 
alteration  that  has  taken  place  in  their  deportment.  I  continue 
to  be  on  very  friendly  terms  with  the",  all,  and  in  return,  they 
seem  much  attached  to  me,  which  is  encouraging." 

Mr.  M'M array  having  represented  some  premises,  situate 

on  the  banks  of  the  River  St.  Mary,  and  the  jn-operty  of  E.  O. 

iM-matinger,  Esq.  of  Montreal,  to  be  in  every  res])ect  convenient 

and  desirable  as  the  site  of  the  Mission  entrusted  to  his  care, 

the  Commitee  successfully  negociated  with  that  gentleman  for 

the  present  occui»ation  of  them  at  a  fixed  rent.     Through  the 

liberal  assistance  of  the  Governuient,  hopes  are  entertained  of 

the  property  becoming  permanently  vested  in  the  Society.     Mr. 

M'AIurray  describes  the  landed  i)roperty  to  be  four  acres  wide 

in  front,  on  the  river,  from  which,  to  the  hill,  are  thirty  acres. 

"  We  could    not  place  the  Indians  below  the  hill  ;  there  is  no 

wood  ;  the  land  is  rather  low  and  wet,  and  not  a  siifhciency. 

Beyond  the  hill  or  rise,  the  land  is  excellent ;  hard  wood  and 

fine  soil ;   a  soutliern  aspect,  and  sheltered  from  the  northern 

winds.    This  is  the  place  where  the  Indians  wish  their  village 

to  be,  a  choice  in  which  I  concur."     In  a  ])ostscript  he  says  : 

"There  are  six  or  seven  vld  ifiV/ows  here,  who  wish  to  join  us  ; 

two  of  them  have  already  done  so  :  could  you  devise  any  jjlan 

by  which  they   could   get  some  yearly  sup])ort  ?     Some  have 

children,  and   others  grand-children  :    a  small  sum   annually 

would  not  only  1)e  an  assistance,  but  a  charity  ;    for  they  are 

truly  poor  and   needy.     I  have  given   them   many  ])resents  of 

provisions,  but  my  means  are  so  small,  I  can  but  ill  afford  it." 

May  2. — The  Committee  iiot  ])eing  satisfied  of  the  com- 
petency of  the  two  Indians  desirous  to  be  sent  as  Christian 
Instructors  to  their  brethren  of  the  Michipicoton  and  the  Pic, 
had  not  encouraged  their  ])roposal.  To  this,  Mr.  M'Murray 
adverts  — "  As  regards  sending  the  two  young  men  to  Lake 
Superior.  1  leave  it  entirely  to  the  Committee  ;  yet,  1  cannot 
,i,'ive  up  the  idea  of  their  usefulness  there.  I  proposed  it,  not  for 
the  purpose  of  forming  regular  establishments  there  at  j)resent, 
hut  merely  to  prepare  the  minds  of  toe  Indir.as  for  such,  at  a 
future  period."  He  undertakes  to  procure  persons  to  bring  the 
land,  attached  to  the  Mission,  again  under  cultivation  ;  and 
applies  for  a  further  grant  of  money  to  erect,  besides  a  school-

honso,  a  sufficient  number  of  huts  for  the  accommodation  of 
twenty  families.  "  In  reply  to  liis  Excellency's  on(|uiry,  (after 
his  proffr  'ss  in  the  Chippowji  lan;,'iiiiL,'e,)  be  pleased  to  say  that 
[  am  doini»'  as  well  as  1  could  expect,  for  thci  time  I  have  been 
here  ;  I  can  make  myself  understood  in  cotnmon  conversation. 
The  Indians  assure  me  I  a&lt;lvance  rajjidly  ;  but  the  difficulty 
cxc(H&lt;ds  my  calculation.  As  so  much  care  is  required  in 
iustructiuf''  i&lt;»'n(U'aut  and  illiterate  persons,  I  am  not  desirous 
of  attempting'  to  converse  with  them  upon  r(»li&lt;&gt;'ious  subjects, 
otlu-rwise  than  throu^'h  an  interpreter,  until  I  shall  have  better 
mastered  the  lauj^iiai^e." 

On  the  30th  Aj)ril,  Mr.  IM'Murray  moved  into  the  Alansion- 
hous(&gt;,  which,  with  other  out-buildin^s,  the  Society  now  rents  of 
Mr.  Ermatini,n&gt;r.  Since  the  date  of  his  last  letter,  he  had 
•*  baptized  an  Indian  widow,  seventy  years  of  ap^e,  who  had  lonj,' 
kept  back,  for  fear  of  not  bein^'  i)roi)erly  pre])ared  for  so  solemn 
an  ordinance."  Four  persons  in  the  faiiiili(&gt;s  of  two  American 
officers,  at  Fort  IJrady,  had  also  received  ba])tism  at  his  hands. 
Attain,  he  asks, — "  Can  any  thing  be  done  in  behalf  of  the  vour 

n'uiowsr 

May  3. — When  recommended  by  the  committee  to  try 
whether  his  interpreter  mi&lt;rht  not  bo  useful  to  him  in  the  capacity 
of  school  master,  Mr.  M'M.  reidied—  "That  leaving  his  qualifica- 
tions out  of  the  question,  the  Indians  would  never  submit  to  bo 
taught  by  him — their  reason  being,  that  ho  was  an  Indian  like 
themselves."  Here  again,  in  alluding  to  the  efforts  made  by 
other  Christian  societies,  for  the  conversion  of  the  Indians  beyond 
the  Sault,  on  Lake  Superior,  he  regrets  the  existence  of  obstacles 
to  the  so(;iety's  sending  native  speakers  into  the  same  field,  and 
adds — "  Incalculable  good  might  be  done  in  these  northern  re- 
gions, were  the  attention  of  the  Christian  world  once  engaged  in 
behalf  of  the  benighted  inhabitants.  There  is  work,  I  might 
safely  say,  for  a  hundred  Missionanies." 

June  24. — In  a  letter  of  this  date,  Mr.  M'M.  suites  that  most 
of  the  Indians  belonging  to  the  Sault,  had  good  gardens,  and 
were  likely  to  gather  a  great  deal  of  useful  produce  for  their 
families. 

July  7- — "  Our  potatoes  look  very  well,  and  .i  the  weather 
be  favourable  we  shall  have  a  sufficiency  for  use,  and  for  seed 
next  spring.  Yesterday  I  baptized  three  persons,  two  adults 
and  an  infant  child  of  one  of  the  Hon.  Hudson's  Bay  Company's 
clerks." 

AirGusT  28. — Mr.  M'M.  writes — "  The  number  of  Indians  at 
this  place  during  the  summer  has  been  very  unusual,  chiefly  from 
the  head  waters  of  Lake  Superior,  Leech  and  Sandy  Lakes,  who, 
from  their  constant  visits,  have  taken  up  a  great  deal  of  my  time. 
I  re-opened  the  school  in  the  beginning  of  June,  but  where  tlx; 
master's  attention  is  so  often  called  off  to  other  more  important 
parts  of  his  duty,  the  business  of  instruction  must  necessarily  be 
much  imp.  ded.  My  regret  at  the  interruption  was  the  greater,  as 
the  number  of  scholars  in  attendence  was  considerable."  (How- 
ever, the  committee  might  desire  to  be  able  to  remit  their  Mission- 
ary altogether  from  the  superintendence  of  the  school  to  the 
higJier  functions  of  the  ministry,  for  which  the  demand  has  becoiutt

so  proat,  they  could  not  vonture,  with  funds  so  small,  to  incur  the 
expence  of  any  new  appointment.  But  they  are  happy  to  add, 
that  when  their  necessities  were  made  known  to  his  Excellency 
the  Lieutenant-Governor,  he  was  pleased  to  say,  that  for  the  pre- 
sent at  least,  he  would  see  that  they  were  supplied.  It  is  hoped 
a  schoolmaster  will  soon  be  on  his  way  to  Mr.  M'Murray's  relief.) 
He  continues — *'  Scarcely  a  day  passes,  but  the  greater  part  of  it 
I  am  confined  to  my  room  ;  no  sooner  have  I  finisheu  with  one 
band  (of  Indians),  than  another  come«?  in  to  converse  with  me. 
The  disagreeable  smell  of  the  weed  which  they  chew  with  their 
tobacco  |)roducofi  in  strangers  a  severe  and  incessant  head-ache, 
from  which  I  have  been  by  no  means  exempted.  It  is  impossible 
to  escape  from  an  Indian  who  desires  your  notice  and  conversa- 
tion. He  comes  at  all  hours,  ignorant  of  their  relative  conve- 
nience or  inconvenience.  The  plainest  intimations  fail  to  make 
him  sensible  of  intrusion.  I  have,  therefore,  no  other  remedy 
than  to  sit  still  during  the  greater  part  of  these  interminable  in- 
terviews, and  exercise  the  necessary  patience."  In  order  to 
meet  the  exigencies  of  this  period,  he  increased  his  sei^vices  on 
Sunday  to  three,  and  the  weekly  services  to  two  ;  the  numbers 
usually  attending  them  varied  from  one  hundred  and  fifty  to  two 
hundred  persons,  all  Indians. 

After  mentioning  the  admission  at  this  time  of  six  persons, 
by  bonfism,  into  the  Church,  ho  says  : — "  Many  more  are  thinking 
seriously,  and  incline  to  follow  the  example  of  their  brethren,  all 
of  whom  remain  steadfast  in  the  faith,  in  no  instance,  whatever, 
reverting  to  their  former  practices.  They  hold  religious  meetings 
among  themselves,  on  such  days  as  they  do  not  attend  nie.  As 
might  be  expected  from  the  nature  of  our  holy  religion,  the  new 
convert  soon  becomes  warmly  interested  for  his  benighted 
brethren  ;  and  his  anxiety  on  this  account  will  be  no  matter  of 
surprise  to  those  whose  birth  and  education  have  been  Chris- 
tian." "  Our  harvest  bids  fair  to  be  abundant ;  our  crop  of  hay 
has  been  heavy,  and  the  proceeds  of  the  farm  would  be  very 
considerable,  if  we  had  a  proper  person  to  take  cliarge  of  it.  ' 
Our  pastures  are  excellent,  and  a  small  stock  of  cattle  would 
enable  us  to  raise  our  own  supplies." 

In  allusion  to  the  labours  of  the  Society's  Travelling  Mis- 
sionary, as  detailed  in  the  third  report,  ISIr.  M'M. : '  irks — "  I 
am  happy  to  find  that  Mr.  Elliot  has  succeeded  so  well,  and  trust 
that  his  efibrts  will  be  as  prosperous  every  ensuing  year.  It  will 
be  readily  perceived  that  of  the  two  missionaries  employed  by 
the  society  he  must  take  the  lead.  Whilst  I  am  addressing  an 
unenlightened,  uncivilized  people,  through  the  diflicult  medium 
of  a  foreign  language,  his  pains  are  bestowed  on  the  civilized 
and  enlightened,  who  have  the  word  direct  from  his  mouth,  in 
their  own  vernacular  tongue.  I  shall,  however,  do  my  best  to 
labour  faithfully,  and  my  whole  study  will  be  to  win  souls  to 
Christ."  "About  six  weeks  ago,  four  Christian  Indians,  mem- 
bers of  my  congregation,  asked  my  leave  to  visit  their  brethren 
at  Michipicoton,  on  Lake  Superior,  for  tlie  purpose  of  speaking 
to  them  on  religion  ;  at  the  same  time,  requesting  to  be  supplied 
with  a  email  quantity  of  pro\'isions  for  the  journey.  As  I 
coupidered  the  objf?rtions  of  the  Committee  to  apply  only  to  the

permdni^nt  cn/jagemont  of  such  services,    I  acriuiescod  in  their 

Sroposnl,  and  furnished  them  with  provisions  to  and  from 
lichipicoton,  at  the  expenco  of  six  dollars.  1  trust  the  sanction 
of  the  Committee  will  not  be  withlicM  to  this  stop,  wliich  I 
considered  it  my  duty  to  take.  On  the  arrival  at  Michipicoton, 
Geo.  Keith,  Es(i.,  Ciiief  Actor  of  the  Hon.  II.  IJ.  Co.  stationed  at 
that  place,  wrote  to  me  thus  : — *  I  have  only  time  to  inform  you 
that  I  duly  received  your  fa vour,per  Augustus  and  his  companions, 
some  few  days  since,  and  tliat  they  appear  contented  with  their 
reception  and  professional  ])r()spectvs.'  liy  their  return  home  the 
same  j»entleman  wrote — *  Your  young  men  are  speaking  of  taking 
their  departure  at  no  distant  date.  I  am  really  amazed  at  the 
knowledge  thoy  liave  acquired  of  Clu'istianity.  They  have 
behaved  in  every  respect  with  the  greatest  propi'iety,  and  I  am 
persuaded  the  scckI  they  have  sown  will  bring  forth  fruit  to 
repentance  and  reformation.'  I  will  not  trouble  the  Committee, 
adds  Mr.  M'Murray,  Avith  any  remarks  of  my  own,  regarding 
their  visit,  but  will  let  the  extracts  from  this  gentleman's  letters 
speak  in  their  behalf : — '  I  cannot,  however,  ^&gt;rbear  saying,  that 
the  circumstance  is  peculiarly  gi-atifying  to  me,  and  o])erates  to 
spur  me  on  to  gi'eater  exertions.  Tliey  report  that  tlieir 
brethren  at  Michii)icoton  were  most  anximis  to  hear  the  Avord 
of  life,  and  solicited  them,  at  their  dei)arture,  to  request  leave  of 
their  minister  for  one  of  them  to  come  and  remain  as  tlieir 
teacher.'  The  *  door'  has  thus  been  *  oi)ened'  for  future  labourers 
to  *  enter  in.'  Aware  that  in  the  proscMit  state  of  the  Society's 
finances,  the  appointment  of  new  ]Missionaries  is  not  to  ho 
expected,  yet  I  do  not  despair  of  seeing  them  appointed.  God, 
who  is  *  willing  that  none  should  jjcrish,'  is  also  able  to  send 
the  means  of  salvation  to  these  sequestered  tribes,  and  in  His 
own  good  time  will  all  his  purposes  be  acconi] dished." 

in  a  letter  of  a  subsequent  date  he  says — "  The  I)idians 
have  nearly  all  removed  from  us,  and  are  gone  to  their  Avintor 
haunts  for  a  short  time.  They  declai-e  they  Avill  abseiit  them- 
selves no  more  in  this  way  hereafter.  I  am  much  ])leascd  with 
their  punctual  attendance  upon,  and  devout  behaviour  at,  reli- 
gious worship,  as  well  as  their  general  conduct  during  la'^t 
summer.  I  entertain  the  hope  that  their  confidence  is  com- 
pletely gained.  For  myself,  I  feel  lastingly  attached  to  tliem, 
and  have  reason  to  believe  that  the  attachment  is  reciproc.ii. 
Our  pros])ects  brighten  daily,  and  justify  my  belief,  that  with  the 
continuance  of  the  Divine  ])lessing,  the  success  of  the  mission  iy 
now  placed  beyond  all  doubt." 

Ffor.i  the  above  extracts  it  appears  that,  witli  his  hitherto 
imperfect  o])i)ortunities,  Mr.  M'Murray  has  succeeded  in  gaining 
the  affections  of  the  people  to  whom  he  was  sent,  and  a  wiUliijr 
audience  to  the  message  which  he  carrijd.  By  the  liberality  ot 
the  Lieut.-Governor,*a  school-house  is  now  erecting  for  the  use  of 
the  mission,  and  the  appointment  of  a  school-master  in  contem- 
plation. Houses  are  also  l)uilding  for  the  accommodation  of  at 
least  twenty  Indian  families.  With  the  possr  ^ion  of  these 
additional  advantages,  the  Missionary's  means  of  usefulness  must 
be  greatly  oncroased.     During  the  past  year  ho  has  beon  made

THE  SPEECH 

Of  a  principal  Chief  of  the  (hjUncnij  or  Chlppeira  Nation,  named 
ChlmjuacosCf  In  tluir  behalfy  on  hearing  the  Address  read  from  the 
Society  for  Conterthuj  and  Civilizing  the  Indians^  ibllshcd  at 
Toronto,  1830. 

My  Fathers,* — We,  the  Indians  of  the  Oj^ihway  Nation, 
residing'  at  the  Sault  St.  Marie,  are  thankful  to  you  for  your 
kind  offers,  for  endeavouring^  to  settle  and  civilize  us,  but  we 
thiidc  that  our  lands  here  are  so  poor,  that  even  if  we  were  to 
settle  upon  them,  and  endeavour  to  follow  the  pursuits  of 
a^jriculture,  they  would  not  yield  us  a  sufficiency  to  supjiort  us. 

'My  FATHERjt — For  the  last  three  sunnners  we  have  heard 
with  great  satisfaction  your  kind  offers  in  promisin&lt;i;  to  build 
houses  for  us  to  dwell  in,  and  in  sending  us  a  teacher  to  instruct 
us  aud  our  young  men,  together  with  our  young  children,  and 
we  feel  very  thankful  to  you  for  the  sanu',  for  we  are  very  i)oor 
at  present.  Formerly  our  lands  had  enougli  of  game  and  other 
animals  for  us  to  subsist  upon,  but  at  present  we  cannot  procure 
enough  from  them  to  support  us. 

My  Fathers, — We  have  ears  to  hear  with,  and  hearts  to 
give  us  sense  :  Avhy  should  we  not  hear  and  receive  your  teacher, 
and  your  other  kind  offers  towards  our  civilization  ? 

!My  Fatueus, — Pay  j^articular  attention  to  what  I  am 
going  to  say  :  at  present  we  are  like  as  many  wild  animals  in 
the  woods,  we  have  no  place  to  shelter  us  from  the  bad  storms, 
but  wliere  night  linds  us,  there  we  are  compelled  to  remain. 

My  Father, — I  give  my  hand  with  a  good  heart,  and  all 
around  me  do  the  same,  to  our  Great  Father  the  King,  to  the 
Governor  of  Quebec,  and  likewise  to  the  Governor  at  York,  aud 
we  all  feel  glad  to  hear  that  they  wish  us  v.'cU,  and  the  offers 
which  they  liave  made,  not  only  to  us,  but  to  our  children. 
When  a  child  is  uneasy  or  dissatisfied  in  a  lodge,  we  give  it 
something  to  please  it,  but  we  are  not  like  it.  We  have  heard 
for  the  last  four  years  that  houses  were  to  be  built  for  us,  but 
we  do  not  even  see  them  begun  ;  but  we  have  ears  to  hear  with, 
and  hearts  to  understand.  W  we  should  see  the  buildings  up, 
it  would  satisfy  us,  together  with  our  young  men,  and  then  wo 
woidd  attend  to  tlie  pursuits  of  agriculture,  and  settle  upon  out 
lands.  When  once  we  see  the  buildings  erected,  there  is  no 
doubt  but  that  we  shall  remain  stationary  and  occupy  them. 

*  Addressed  to  the  Society. 
tAddreased  to  Mr.  M'Murray  the  Mixsionary,  as  representliiKSlr  J.  Colhorue.

Look,  my  Futliers,  what  you  wliite  people  do,  it  is  you  who 
brinj^  the  liquors  into  this  country,  for  we  are  not  able  to  make 
Iheui  ourselves.  We  should  never  have  known  what  liquor*^ 
W3re  if  you  had  not  brou^'ht  them  to  us— ntuther  myself,  nor 
my  forefathers,  knew  how  to  make  them  ;  and  when  the  whites 
knew  that  it  would  bo  injurious  to  the  Indians,  they  should  have 
lett  it  behind.  Next  spring,',  we  shall  look  for  the  Government 
to  build  the  houses  for  us,  together  with  a  meeting  house  and  a 
school  house,  and  we  arc  now,  and  shall  then  be  willing  to  be 
instructed  in  the  principles  of  the  Christian  Religion. 

My  Father, — AVe  hope  you  will  not  forget  us,  but  give  us 
also  wherewith  to  cultivate  our  lands,  and  thus  endeavour  to 
procure  a  living  for  ourselves,  as  we  have  nothing  of  ourselves. 

It  is  not  the  first  time  wo  have  asked  for  tliese  things,  we 
ask  Capt.  Anderson,  at  Penetanguishine,  every  summer  for  them, 
but  we  cannot  tell  whcither  ho  makes  known  our  wants  to  our 
Father  at  York  or  not.  I  do  not  fear  for  myself  a'one,  but  for 
all  the  other  Chiefs  around  me,  and  the  whole  natio'..  I  suppose 
our  Father  thinks  we  are  like  children,  always  sitting  and 
warming  ourselves  at  the  fire,  and  also  thinks  we  are  such,  as 
regards  rum  ;  but  it  is  not  so  with  us,  for  dui'ing  the  winter  we 
live  upon  meat  and  fish,  and  any  other  game  we  may  chance  to 
get  in  the  woods  :  but  when  we  see  the  white  people  in  the 
spring,  they  offer  us  a  glass,  and  we  take  it. 

My  Father, — There  are  a  great  many  old  women  amongst 
us,  who  are  not  able  to  go  down  to  Penetanguishine  for  their 
presents,  aiul  we  should  like  to  know  if  their  relations  who  go 
down  could  not  draw  them  for  them  ;  we  would  also  like  to 
know  if  the  presents  could  not  be  given  out  here,  instead  of  our 
going  down  for  them. 

We  all  give  our  hands,  with  good  hearts,  to  our  kind 
Father  at  York,  and  we  hope  the  promises  we  have  heretofore 
heard  will  be  performed. 

My  Father,  I  am  done.

SECOND  SPEECH  OF  SHINGUACOSE, 

Upon  hearinj  that  a  School-hovse  was  to  he  erecte&gt;^   at  tlie  same  tme 

thanking  h;8  Great  Father  for  the  same,  and  for  sending  a  Minister

My  Father, — I  send  you  my  compliments,  I  thank  you 

very  much,  in  the  behalf  of  my  nation,  for  sending  a  Teacher 

amongst  us,  for  the  purpose  of  instructing  us  and  our  children 

in  the  Christian  Religion.    I  have  often  heard  him  speak,  ami 

like  him  and  wliat  he  says  very  much.     I  shall  keep  what  the 

good  Teacher  you  sent  amongst  us  tells,  in  my  heart. 

My  Father, — I  love  the  Teacher  whom  you  have  sent  here 
with  my  whole  heart,  and  am  now  ready,  and  will  attend  to  tho

INDIAN  MISSION  AT  SAULT  ST.  MARIE. 

Journal  of  the  Rev.  Win.  M^ Murray,  at  SattU  St.  Marie,  dated  July 

22nd,  183o. 

It  is  with  gi'eat  satisfaction  that  I  am  able  to  assure  the 
Committee,  that  the  good  work  which  I  have  in  hand  is  progres- 
sing, and  that  my  ministrations  have  been,  and  continue  to  be, 
attended  with  much  deeper  interest  than  before. 

The  following  report  will  give  a  concise  statement  of  my 
labours  since  I  had  last  the  pleasure  of  addressing  you. 

Owing  to  the  distance  the  Indians  were  removed  from  the 
mission  during  the  hunting  season,  our  services  for  the  month  of 
April,  and  the  greater  part  of  May,  were  confined  to  one  each 
Sunday.  This  great  impediment  will,  I  think,  be  removed  by 
drawing  the  attention  of  the  Indian  to  the  cultivation  of  the  soil, 
a  period  which  every  well-wisher  to  their  tribes  cannot  fail  to 
look  forward  to  with  the  greatest  interest. 

Sunday,  May  3rd. — According  to  a  previous  arrangement, 
I  proceeded  to  a  river  distant  about  nine  miles  from  this  place 
(See  Acts  xvi.  13,)  for  the  purpose  of  preaching  to  the  Indians. 
When  I  arrived  at  their  lodges,  I  found  every  thing  in  readiness, 
and  my  arrival  anxiously  looked  for  by  a  considerable  number

of  tlit'iii,  altliouLfli  tlie  day  was  wet  anil  stormy.  The  silence 
wliicli  pievailea  throuj^hout  their  little  encampment,  as  well  as 
the  rest  from  their  respective  labours,  evinced  a  more  than  ordi- 
nary season.  I  was  really  cheered  to  find  that  although  they 
were  absent  from  me,  the^  still  remembered  they  had  a  God  to 
serve,  and  that  one  day  in  seven  si-  &gt;nld  be  set  aside  for  his 
worship. 

On  Sunday  tlio  10th,  I  baptized  Peter  Matthews,  an  infant 
of  one  of  the  members  of  our  Church.  And  on  Sunday  the  17th, 
I  baptized  John  K()l)ert.son,  an  adult,  twenty-six  years  of  a&lt;^e,  a 
son  of  the  Honourable  Hudson's  liay  Company's  Interpreter  at 
Michipicotan.  It  gave  me  great  pleasure  to  hear  him  answer, 
verbatim,  the  questions  contained  in  the  baptismal  service,  when 
put  to  him. 

On  Sunday  the  24th,  I  was  enabled  to  hold  two  full  services, 
as  many  of  the  Indians  had  come  out  from  their  hunting  grounds. 
About  thirty  attended. 

Monday  the  25th. — According  to  a  previous  notice,  I  held  a 
meeting  for  the  purpose  of  forming  a  Temperance  Society,  (See 
the  Church  Catechism,  Duty  to  God  and  Duty  to  our  Neighbour) 
amongst  the  Indians,  thinking  that  such  a  thing  would  do  very 
beneficial  to  them.  I  addressed  -the  meeting  on  the  evils  of  in- 
temperance in  di-inking,  (See  the  Speech  of  the  Chief  Shin- 
guacose,)  and  also  on  the  benefits  arising  from  temperance  ;  and 
closed  by  drawing  up  a  short  form,  to  which  I  told  them  I  wished 
their  signatures.  The  meeting  was  then  adjourned  to  the 
Thursday  following,  in  order  that  they  might  have  time  to  weigh 
the  matter  well,  before  placing  themselves  under  any  restriction. 

"  The  prudence  or  propriety  of  this  step  may  be  questioned, 
"  however  well  intentioned,  and  does  not  seem  quite  in  unison 
"  with  the  conduct  of  the  Apostles,  (Acts  xv.  6 — 11,)  who  were 
"  content  to  preach  temperance,  (2  Peter  1.  5 — 8,)  as  the  fruit  of 
"  convei*sion  to  the  Christian  faith,  without  placing  their  disci- 
*'  pies  under  the  dangerous  temptation  of  voluntary  rows." 

"  GroiD  in  grace,  and  in  the  kuowledgj  of  our  Lord  and 
*  Saviour."  (2  Peter  iii.  18,  and  from  Titus  i.  8,  and  xi.  2.)  It 
"  would  seem  St.  Paul  thought  it  not  likely  to  be  expected,  as 
"  the  first  fruit  of  conversion,  but  the  mark  of  advancement  in 
grace.    That  the  aged  men  be  sober,  temperate,  «Scc." — Editor. 

Thursday  the  28th,  the  Indians  again  assembled  and  nine 
signatures  were  obtained,  all  of  whom  having  strictly  kept  their 
pledge,  as  far  as  my  knowledge  has  extended.  I  also  put  my 
own  name  to  the  list,  more  for  example  than  from  any  fear  of 
breaking  through  the  rules  of  temperance.  In  union  there  is 
strength.    "  Let  him  that  tliinketh  he  standeth  take  heed." — Ed. 

Sunday  the  31st,  had  two  services,  after  the  evening  service 
an  Id  man,  about  fifty-six,  came  into  my  room  and  requested 
my  attention  for  a  short  time.  On  giA'ing  my  assent  he  com- 
menced by  saying,  that  he  had  thought  very  seriously  of  reli- 
gion for  a  long  time,  and  had  no^y  made  up  his  mind  to  try  and 
embrace  it.  He  said  he  felt  as  if  he  was  walking  in  a  thick 
forest  after  a  heavy  fall  of  snow,  which  had  so  covered  the 
bushes  that  he  was  unable  to  see  the  sky  ;  but  going  on  a  little 
further  he  came  to  an  opening  whore  the  sky  was  visible,  and

rvt'cy  thin^  around  liiiii.  This  lie  continued,  was  his  case  ; 
when  lie  attended  my  services  he  could  ^ee  the  way  clearly,  but 
when  he  absented  hnnselt'  he  felt  us  if  it  was  clouded,  and  ob- 
structions thrown  in  his  way.  Ho  said  he  was  getting  ohl,  and 
his  only  desire  was  to  attend  to  tlie  *'  one  thing  needful."  1  well 
remember  the  first  time  1  sj)ol&lt;e  to  this  man  on  religion,  about 
two  years  ago,  and  equally  well  do  1  remember  his  answer — *'  Oh, 
"  it  may  be  a  good  thing  for  you  or  your  children,  but  for  my 
"  part,  I  do  not  wish  to  know  any  thing  about  it ;  you  need  not 
"  mind  me,  just  pass  by  mo  unheeded"  whs  his  then  rcj)ly. 
What  a  change  hivs  two  years  produced  ?  See  him  now  coming 
forward,  voluntarily,  to  listen  to  the  glad  tidings  of  salvation, 
and  to  em[uire  his  way  to  Zion.  He  has  since  sjiokeu  to  me  on 
baptism,  and  I  make  no  doubt  ho  will  be  among  the  first  to  como 
forward. 

Wednesday,  June  lOth,  I  baptized  an  Indian  about  forty- 
six  years  of  age. 

Sunday  the  14th,  a  large  congregation  assembled  and  were 
very  attentive  ;  after  morning  service,  1  baptized  five  Indians  at 
tiie  respective  ages  of  thirty-five,  fifty-fivo,  fifteen,  ten,  and  two, 
and  after  evening  service  two  Indians  were  married  according  to 
tiie  forms  of  the  Ciiurch. 

Wednesday  the  17th,  after  service  I  baptized  the  eldest  son 
of  the  chief,  about  thirty-five  years  of  age,  another  Indian,  a 
female,  aged  twenty-two,  a  boy  about  two,  and  an  infant.  The 
man  took  my  name,  his  father,  the  chief.  Laving  done  so  when 
he  was  baptized  in  January. 

On  Sunday  the  2 1st,  I  married  two  Indians  after  evening 
f3ervice. 

Saturday  the  27th,  Captain  Anderson  and  the  Rev.  Adam 
Elliot  arrived  from  Penetanguishine.  The  Indians  were  quite 
delighted  to  see  their  father,  and  another  "  black  coat"  (which  is 
their  name  for  clergyman  generally)  and  many  vollies  were  fired 
from  their  guns  on  the  occasion,  as  a  token  of  joy.  I  immedi- 
ately requested  Mr.  Elliot  to  administer  the  Sacrament  of  the 
Lord's  Supper  to  us  on  the  following  day.  Mr.  Elliot  held  a 
meeting  in  the  evening  in  a  lodge  which  the  Indians  had  made 
for  their  own  private  worship.  After  Mr.  E.  had  finished  his 
discourse  I  married  four  Indian  couples. 

On  Sunday  the  28th,  after  a  sermon  and  lecture  by  Mr. 
Elliot,  I  assisted  him  in  administering  the  Sacrament  of  the 
liord's  Supper.  There  were  thirty-five  communicants,  twenty- 
five  of  whom  were  Indians  of  the  mission.  This  being  the  first 
time  of  having  it  administered,  T  allowed  all  the  Heathen  Indians 
to  remain  in  the  room,  thinking  that  the  solemnity  of  the  service 
might  make  some  impression  on  them. 

The  school  has  been  a  good  deal  interrupted  since  its  com- 
mencement, owing  in  a  groat  measure  to  tJie  wandering  habits  of 
the  Indians,  and  which  1  fear  will  continue  to  be  the  case  until 
they  can  be  settled  upon  their  lands.  If  the  children  could  be 
supported  during  their  attendance  at  school,  (in  the  same  manner 
{!S  at  Coldwater,)  independent  of  tlieir  parents,  much  might,  I 
think,  be  effected.  The  average  number  in  attendance  has  been 
about  thirty.    Some  of  the  c-hildron  are  beginning  to  lead,  and

EXTRACT. 

We  have  a  good  cause  in  hand,  one  that  will  bear  tho 
severest  scrutiny,  one  that  has  oftentimes,  before  our  day,  been 
tried  in  the  fire  ;  let  us  strain  every  \u  ve  for  its  advancement, 
until  tho  millions  of  uncojiverted  souls,  now  grojjing  in  heathen 
dai'kness  around  us,  have  heard  of  a  crucified  Jte&lt;leemer.  When 
one  reflects  upon  the  scarcity  of  labourers  in  this  part  of  tho 
Lord's  vineyard,  and  which  is  already  rij)e  for  tho  sickle,  as  the 
following  statement  will  shew,  we  cannot  help  exclaiming,  in  the 
language  of  our  Divine  Masters,  "  The  harvest  truly  is  plenteous, 
"  but  the  labourei's  are  few  ;  pray  ye  therefore  the  Lord  of  the 
"  harvest,  that  he  will  send  forth  labourers  to  his  harvest."  Let 
this  be  our  mutual  prayer,  and  let  our  actions  correspond  there- 
with, whilst  we  have  strength  allowed  us,  or  whilst  there  re- 
mains one  unconverted  soul  around  ;  bearing  in  mind  alway  that 
precious  promise  made  in  the  scriptures  of  truth  to  us  who  are 
but  dust  and  ashes,  "  they  that  turn  many  to  righteousness  shall 
dhine  like  the  stars  of  heaven,"  in  the  firmament  of  their  Re- 
deemer. It  gives  me  much  pleasure  to  be  able  to  inform  you 
(as  I  am  satisfied  you  will  be  desirous  of  hearing)  that  my  mis- 
sion continues  to  be  in  a  very  properous  situation.  Things  have 
turned  out  far  beyond  my  most  sanguine  expectations.  Little 
did  T  liiink  when  I  first  entered  upon  this  arduous  but  high  cill- 
ing,  that  things  woTild  have  tak(&gt;n  the  tenor  they  have,  little  did 
I  think  that  the  lapse  of  scarcely  four  years  Avould  have  accom- 
plished what  it  has,  but  it  is  the  Lord's  doing,  and  to  him  be  all 
the  praise.  What  cannot  lie  bring  to  pass  I  Is  any  thing  too 
hard  for  the  Lord  ?  Surely  not,  unless  we  take  away  one  of  his 
glorious  attributes — Omnipotence. 

Three  Simdays  ago  I  baptized  thirteen  persons,  and  the 
Sunday  following  twenty-six,  about  two-thirds  of  the  whole 
number   were   Indians.      The  total   number  of   baptisms  oiu'

The  Iluly  Cunnnunion  h;i8  buon  udnunisli'i-fd  twice,  the  wliole 
nuinhor  of  cointniinii'iints  sixty-six.  Is  nut  thi-i  un  (&gt;ncuura&lt;;ini{ 
bojjinnin^?  Otiior  missionaries  have;  liiliourcd,  in  othiT  ^jronnu, 
soino  four,  some  five,  some  ten  V'urs,  without  even  a  sin)j;ie  eoni- 
munieant.  It  is  trnly  astonishm;;  to  see  tlio  tliirst  there  in  in 
these  rejrions  for  seriptnre  Itimwh'd^'e.  Tlie  Indians,  like  tho 
man  of  Macedonia  of  ohl,  are  calling  "  for  help,"  for  misHion- 
aries  from  all  (piarters.  Why  cannot  they  lie  sent  ?  Are  there 
no  more  Brainerds,  no  morollehers,  no  more  Martvns  or  Elliots 
who  will  enj!;afj;e  in  this  most  humane  and  most  (christian  of  nil 
undertakings  {  Shall  these  poor  Heathens,  thirsting;  as  they  are 
for  it,  he  permitted  to  perish  for  lack  of  knowledj^e  i  I  sincerely 
trust  that  some  f^rand  effort  will  he  sj)eedily  made  for  amelio- 
rating their  wretched  condition.  This  solitary  mission  has  had 
a  very  salutary  and  extensive  influence  over  tho  neighbouring 
parts.  Five  or  six  zealous  missionaries  might  bo  most  profitably 
engaged  at  the  present  moment  in  this  quarter. 

Very  recently  two  hands  of  Indians  came  to  me  from  a  dis- 
tance of  more  than  fonr  hundred  and  fifty  miles,  for  the  express 
purpose  of  being  instructed  from  the  Great  Spirit's  Book,  as  they 
call  the  bible,  and  of  being  baptized.  They  stated  that  they  had 
long  heard  of  this  mission,  and  had  now  come  to  see  "  the  black 
coat,"  their  iisual  designation  for  every  clergyman,  and  of  hear- 
ing hin\  speak  the  good  news  of  which  they  had  heard  a  little. 
I  hoj)e  to  see  the  time,  ere  long,  when  missionaries  will  go  in 
search  of  these  poor  sheep,  instead  of  seeing  them  travel  so 
far  in  search  of  missionaries.  I  saw  Mr.  Elliot  a  short  time  ago, 
ho  told  me  of  his  a])pointment  to  the  new  Indian  Mission  on  the 
Great  Manitoulin  Island  on  Lake  Huron.  I  wish  we  had  a  few 
pioresucli.  Suppose  you  offer  yourself  for  missionary  service 
here.  The  claim  of  the  Indians  is  not  loss  strong  in  my  opinion 
than  that  of  the  Whites,  and  I  assure  you  you  will  find  here  an 
ample  Held  for  active  exertion.  I  should  like  much  to  have  you 
as  my  fellow  labourer  in  those  interesting  quarters,  but  I  sup- 
pose you  are  too  comfortably  situated  in  Lower  Canada,  to  think 
of  such  a  change.  If  your  pillow  be  soft,  be  careful  not  to 
recline  too  much  upon  itj  for  fear  of  a  surprise.

consisted  of  from  thirty  to  forty  persons,  chielly  I'ipiscopalians, 
but  the  weather  havinj^  become  very  unsettled  towards  noon, 
but  very  few  persons  attended  tho  second  servico.  I  was  in- 
formed that  there  are  very  many  families  in  this  neighbourhood 
who  are  members  of  th?  (!hurch,  and  partindarly  desirous  of 
having  her  reguhir  ministrations.  'J'his  station  is  visited  occa- 
sionally by  Mr.  Shirley,  (cateehist,)  who,  in  general,  has  very 
good  congregations,  and  seems  to  be  held  in  high  esteem  by  all 
denominations.  On  Monday,  June  1st,  I  rode  over  to  the  Xapanno

in  this  part  of  the  township  is  very  considerable,  and  a  large,

under  Mr.  Shirley's  superintendence,  of  wliose  indefatigable  zeal 
and  activity  all  i)arties  here,  as  well  as  in  other  ])arts  of  the

Sunday  school  has  also  been  established,  and  is  in  general  very 
well  attended.  'J'ho  congregation  have  had  tho  building  of  a 
Church  for  some  time  in  contemplation,  but  have  not  ^'et  come 
to  any  fixed  resolution  on  the  subject.  On  tho  following  morn- 
ing I  pursued  my  journey  into  Sheffield,  and  read  jjrayers  and 
preached  at  the  clwelling-houpf^  of  Mr.  M'lvim  to  about  twenty 
persons.  Tho  Settlers  in  tlva  township  arc  yet  but  few  in 
number,  and  j)rincipally  of  the  poorest  class.  They  are  occa- 
sionally visited  by  ministers  of  different  denominations  ;  the 
Methodists,  whoso  exertions  to  su]&gt;ply  tho  destitute  with  the 
moans  of  grace  are  most  indefatigable,  find  certainly  well  v/orthy 
of  imitation,  hold  meetings  in  the  neighbourhood  about  once  a 
fortnight.  From  all  I  could  learn,  tho  families  in  this  township, 
who  belong  to  tho  Cluirch,  do  not  exceed  four  or  five  in  number. 

I  intended  to  have  taken  a  direct  course  through  the  town- 
ship of  Richmond  and  Tyendinaca,  to  Shannonville,  but  having 
ascertained  that  tho  road  was  far  too  intricate  for  a  stranger  to

to  unticipatt',  owinj,',  pcrliaps,  to  the  novelty  of  tin'  scenery  n&gt;4 
well  as  the  coiiscion-m'ss  of  not  hoinfj  alone,  even  though  in  the 
depths  of  an  ahnost  inip&lt;'netnihle  forest. 

On  the  Sunday  follo\vin;,%  I  assisted  the  Uev.  ^Ir.  ( 'oehran  in 
the  peifoi-nianee  of  divine  .servie(»  in  tlie  ('lunch  at    It(dlevilla  ; 
ami  on  Monday,  after  having;  been  detained  for  some  Innirs  in

tion of  my  mission;  and    I   reaehed   Uawdon  Mills  early  in   th(5 
ovonin;jf.     The  n(&gt;.\t  day   I    proceeded   to   the  township  &lt;d'  Sey- 
mour, which  township,  thoui,di  not  within  the  limits  of  the  Mid- 
land District,  1  have  heen  (lii-ected  hy  the  Lord   IJishop  to  visit 
occasionally.     From   Major  Cainphell  I  met  with  the  most  kind 
und  encoui'aninj,'  reception,  and   le;irned  that  the   iiiliahitants  of 
the  township  are  particularly  desirous  of  haviiii^f  a  cleiTjyman 
resident  anuui;,'  them,  and    to  whose  mainlenance   they  would 
willinji;ly   contrihutt'.     They   have  aKo  held   the  huihliiifj;  of  a 
Church, or  rathei-,  I  should  say  Churches,  in  contcMuplation  ;  hut 
owin^i;  to  some  little  disa;fi'(!ement  about  the  jirojjosed  site,  they 
have  never  yet  been  able  to  cari-y  their  measures  into  efi'ect. 

As  my  stay  her(»  was  necessaiily  veiy  short,  and  the  Settlers 
very  much  scattered,  1  foutul  that  due  notice  for  divine^  s(&gt;rvice 
could  not  bo  ^'iven,  and  1  tluM-efore  em])loye(l  my  time  on  the 
followin&lt;r  day  in  visiting  several  families  residing  in  the  inimo- 
diute  neighbourhood. 

Having  returned  to  Rawdon  Mills,  I  jun^iclied  to  about 
twenty  jioi'sons  in  the  school-luMise,  a*  d  bajttized  two  (diildren, 
on  the  uflernoon  of  Tluirsday  the.  1  Itli,  I  rude  into  nellevilie  in 
the  evening  in  comjjany  with  Major  ('a!ni)bell.  (.)n  'J'rinity 
Sunday  1  assisted  the  J{ev.  Mr.  Strang  in  the  performance  of 
diviui^  service  at  St.  (Jeorge's  Church,  Kingston. 

My  services  being  no  longer  reipiired  at  Kingston,  on  Satur- 
day .lune  the  2(»th,  1  ])rococded   thence,  i)er  steam   boat,  to  the 
Mohawk  Mission,  and  the  next  day  preached  for  Mr.  (iivin's  in 
the  morning  at  the  Indian  Church,  and  in  the  evening  at  the 
Mapanneo  village,  where  a  numerous  and  most  interesting  con- 
gregation has  been  formed  by  the  exertions  of  Mr.  G.,ai!(l  anew 
neat  stone  church,  now  near  Hs  c(»mi)lelion,  has  been  erected  by 
.1.  S.  Cartwriglit,  of  Kingston.     On  Thursday  the  2r)th,  having 
•arrived   in  the  townshij)  of  Huntingdon,  1  read  laayeis  and 
preached  to  a  numerous  and  attentive  congiegation  at  tlii^  bouse 
of  Mr.  R.  Newton.     The  people  in  this  neighbourhood  seem  to  ])e 
chielly  Episcopalians,  and  mince  great  attachment  to  the  Church, 
and  exj)ro.ssed  much  solicitiule  for  her  regular  ministratums. 

On  Sunday  the  28th,  I  ofHiciatiul  to  n  very  numerous  and 
attentive  assemblage  of  peoi)le  ht  the  Marmora   House,  situated 


1'"  I

i'M'i 


near  the  Marmora  Iron  Wo'k&lt;5 ;  about  a  huiidrod  persons  wero 
present, aiuon&lt;»  whom  were  several  Roman  Catholics  ;  the  Epis- 
copalians tormod  the  most  considerxble  part  of  the  congrega- 
tion ;  but  in  this  toAvnship,  like  most  others  in  tlie  province,  the 
members  of  the  Ciiurch  havinn;  so  long  bt'^n  destitute  of  her 
ministrations,  many  of  them  have  been  comnelled,  as  it  were,  to 
join  other  persuasions  in  search  of  that  instruction  which  they 
had  no  means  of  obtaining  ^"om  tlieir  own.  I  rode  out  some 
distance  through  the  woods  ""uring  the  evening  to  visit  a  sick 
woman,  and  to  L-aptizo  a  child. 

On  tne  following  Tuesday  I  performed  divine  service  and 
preached  at  a  small  school-house  on  the  western  side  of  the 
township  of  Madoo.  About  forty  people  were  p  esent  and  two 
children  were  baptized. 

Returning  again  to  Bellevilla,  I  officiated  twice  for  tlie  Rev. 
Mr.  Cochran,  whose  duties  had  called  him  away  into  some  other 
part  of  I  he  country. 

On  Thursday  the  9tli,,  having  reached  the  township  of  Port- 
land, I  performed  evening  service  and  preached  to  a  numerous 
assemblage  of  persor  ;  at  a  school-house,  m  the  fourth  concession 
of  that  township.  The  majority  of  my  hearers  were  Methodists, 
but  appeared  much  gratified  at  being  visited  by  an  Episcopalian 
Minister,  and  expressed  an  anxious  de  ;ire  to  see  me  frequently 
anif^ng  them. 

The  next  day  I  re.  le  into  West  Lougborough,  and  Tjreaclied 
to  a  small  congregation  assembled  in  the  Methodist  Meeting- 
House,  which  is  liberally  thrown    open  to  all  denominations. 
My  audience  on  this  day  was,  as  usual,  composed  of  all  denomi- 
nations, excepting,  1  believe,  Episcopalians.    There  isj  perhaps, 
no  toraiship  in  the  province  where  the  ill  effects  of  the  want  of 
a  regular  ministry  i.9  more  lamentably  apparent  than  in  this,  for 
the  unfortunate  Settlers  being,  in  a  great  measure,  if  not  indeed 
wholly  destiti  te  of   sound    religious    instruction,   are,  conse- 
quently, literally  tossed  to  and  fro  with  every  kind  of  doctrine 
that  may  chance  to  come  in   among  them.      Numbers  were 
seduced  and  led  away,  about  two  years  ago,  by  the  cunningly 
devised  fables  and  craftiness  of  certain  designing  men  from  the 
United  States,  calling  themselves  Mormonites,  who  pretended  to 
have  discovered  a  portion  of  holy  scripture  hitherto  lost  to  the 
world,  and   which  foretold  that  the  secv)nd  advent  of  Christ 
would  be  in  the  Missouri  Territory,  whither  all  who  would  bo 
saved  must  immediately  resort ;  and  at  the  present  time  the  town- 
ship is  infested  with  another  set  of  Heretics,  nider  the  denomi- 
nation of  "  Christians,"  with  whose  peculiar  tenets  I  have  not 
yet  had  an  opportunity  of  making  myself  acquainted  ;  but  from 
the  little  I  could  learn,  they  appear  t;  deny  the  doctrine  of  the 
Trinity,  and   to  maintain   the  peccability  of  Christ's  human 
ne'. are.    After  service  in  the  evening  I  rode  somo  little  distance 
into  the  country,  to  the  house  of  a  Presbyterian  gentleman  who 
had  requested  me  to  baptize  his  child.    On  the  Sunday  follow- 
ing, having  returned  into  the  township  of  Ernest  town,  I  per- 
formed the  morj-.in;^  service  and  preached  to  a  very  numerous 
and  attentive  congregation  at  Mr.  Empy's  school-house,  in  the

i.ourhood  is  very  con.iderable,  and  two  or  three  times  when  I 
was  heiv  duriiij,''  last  winter,  1  had  very  j^ood  con&lt;4T(\&lt;;ations. 

I  then  crossed  tlie  channel  io  Long  or  Wolf  Island,  and  on 
Sunday  the  liirth  of  .July,  read  prayers  and  preaclu-d  i,i  the 
iii(irnin&lt;f  to  a  hu'/^e  couLrre^^ation  at  the  sch(»ol-house,  when  t  also

The  inhabitants  of  this  island  are,  1  believe  for  the  most  pait, 
Methodists,  but  very  many  of  them  have  never  joined  themselves 
to  any  jiarticvdar  denomination  ;  and  in  the  many  visits  I  have 
now  been  al)le  to  jiay  them,  they  have  all  evinced  great  satisfac- 
tion, and  a])peared  extremely  desirous  of  having  the  regular 
ministrations  of  the  Church  ;  indeed  I  f ( v  1  persuaded,  that  could 
even  the  occasicnal  visits  of  a  cle  -gymau  of  the  Church  be 
secured  to  them,  a  numerous  eongreg.'tion  might  soon  be  formed, 
which,  under  the  blessing  of  God,  cou!&lt;l  not  fail  to  be  attended

noon  have  they  becoiiu!  reconciled  to  their  now  mode  of  life  as 
bucicwoodsnieii. 

On  Siuuhiy  foUowiiiL;',  I  porforniod  divine  service  and 
preacliod  in  a  barn  in  the  inorninL';',  near  Major  Canipljoll's. 
Al)out  fifty  persons  were  present,  the  majority  of  whom  were 
Presbyterians  from  the  borders  of  Scothind,  and  some  few 
members  of  the  Chureh.  All  however  wer(;  most  attentive,  and 
made  the  responses  audibly.  In  the  afteinoon,  1  auain  read 
prayers  and  })reaclied  on  the  opj)osite  side  of  the  river,  to  a 
numerous  and  pai'tieuhirly  attentive  eonni-e^atifin,  assembled 
in  the  upper  chamber  of  a  yiist  mill  belon_i.,nn&lt;!f  to  Mr.  liamsay, 
and  then  baptized  one  child.  The  consfi-e^ation  this  afternoon 
consisted  cliiefly  of  chureh  ])eople,  some  few  of  wliom  joined  in 
the  res])onscs,  which  were  ojude  for  me  by  Mr.  .John  Tiee,  who 
kindly  acted  as  clerk  both  mornin&lt;,^  and  afternoon. 

On  Tuesday  the  l.'lth,  1  read  prayers  and  j)reaelied  at  the 
house  of  Mr.  Gilpin,  in  the  seventh  concession  of  the  township. 
About  thirty  ]&gt;ersons  assembled,  and  three  children  were  bap- 
tized. 'J'he  greater  part  of  my  hearers  on  this  day  were  Knjrlish 
people,  from  the  counties  of  J)evonshire  and  Cornwall,  many  of 
them  decidedly  pious  persons.  The  responses  were  audibly  and 
oo'voutly  made,  with  a  fervour  and  devotion  truly  animatinj^^. 
Where  two  or  three  are  gathered  together  in  His  name,  truly 
the  Lord  is  faithful  to  his  promise  :  lie  will  be  there.  After- 
wards I  rode  some  distance  back  into  the  woods,  to  visit  a  side 
man  ;  I  found  him  still  extremely  ill,  though  better  than  he  had 
been.  He  expressed  and  shewed  much  pleasure  and  thank;  i' 
ness  for  my  visit,  and  readily  ascribed  the  glory  to  God.  i 
I'emaiued  some  time,  and  enjoyed  much  i)leasing,  and  I  trust 
edifying  conversation  with  him,  as  he  is  one,  the  eyes  of  whoso 
understanding  have  been  evidently  enlightened  to  attend  to  the 
things  wliicli  belong  to  his  eternal  peace. 

The  next  day,  I  rode  into  the  tenth  concession,  intending 
to  have  preached  to  the  Scotch  Settlers  in  that  neighbour- 
hood, but  ov  ing  to  some  mistake  about  the  notice,  the  people 
were  not  aware  of  my  coming,  and  consequently  did  not  as- 
semble. I  promised,  however,  if  it  shoidd  be  the  Lord's  will, 
to  pay  them  another  visit  at  a  future  period.  During  the  after- 
noon, I  visited  one  or  two  families  in  the  neighbourhood,  one  of 
which  was  that  of  a  poor  man  from  the  Highlands  of  Scotland, 
who  some  short  time  ago  lost  his  sight  from  a  hurt  which  he  got 
whilst  at  labour  on  his  farm.  Though  now  rendered  perfectly 
lielpless,  he  seems  freely  and  entirely  i*esigned  and  contented — 
casting  all  his  care  on  God.  I  read  and  expounded  a  portion  of 
Scripture  to  liim,  and  was  rejoiced  to  find  ti'om  the  remarks  he 
made,  and  the  whole  tenor  of  his  conversation,  that  he  apjjoared 
to  be  one  led  by  the  teachings  of  the  "Spiru  of  Truth,"  On 
Thursday,  I  again  crossed  the  river,  and  read  j)rayers  and 
preached  in  a  h  irn,  in  the  seventh  concession  :  but  few  persons 
assembled,  as  most  part  of  the  Settlers  were  busily  employed 
getting  in  their  harvest,  which,  owing  to  the  unsettled  state  of 
the  weather,  was  in  danger  of  being  injured.  After  service 
two  children  were  bapt;.:ed.  The  Rev.  Mr.  Givins having  kindly

was  iiappy  to  hear  that  he  met  a  nunu;rous  eongrof^ation — from

cants. 

IJeachinn-  the  township  of  Marmora  on  Tuesday  the  2r&gt;tli, 
during  the  leinainder  of  the  Aveek  I  rode  into  the  several 
Settlements,  and  visited  all  the  Prote'^tant  families  in  each,  and 
in  the  evening  assembled  them  together  at  some  house  in  the 
neighbourhood,  and  read  i)rayers  and  lectured,  either  on  bai)tism 
or  on  souk;  ])ortion  of  Scripture. 

On  Sunday  theliOth,  1  performed  divine  service  and  preached 
in  the  morning  at  the  iron  woi'ks,  and  though  the  weather  was 
very  wet  and  unfavourable,  between  fifty  and  sixty  jjersons 
assembled,  the  greater  \ydvt  of  whom  were  members  of  the 
Church.  In  the  ufteinoon,  I  rode  out  to  the  seventh  concession: 
1  read  the  jirayers  and  i)reached  in  a  school  house,  to  a  numerous 
and  most  attentive  congregation,  and  baptized  (»ne  child.  The 
nii''ority  of  the  Settlers  in  this  part  of  the  township  have  joined 
the  Methodist  Society,  but  have  been  originally  Ciuircli  j&gt;eoi&gt;le, 
and  they  still  retain  a  partiality  for  her  services,  and  seem  to 
1  t'joice  in  the  prospect  of  now  receiving  occasional  visits  from  a 
Clergyman. 

SEPTE^MBER. 

Tuesday  1st,  having  arrived  in  the  townshi])  of  Mador,  I 
proceeded  to  Mr.  OTIara's  school  house,  in  the  fourth  or  fifth 
concession  of  tiuit  township,  where  1  had  made  an  api)ointment 
to  preach  in  the  afternoon,  but  owing  to  some  mistake  in  the 
delivery  of  the  notice,  only  one  far.iily  came  ;  after  passing 
therefore  some  time  in  conversatitn  with  them  on  the  objects  of 
my  Mission,  and  other  topics  connected  with  the  Church,  I 
remounted  my  horse,  and  continued  my  joui'iiey  into  the  back 
Settlements  of  the  same  township,  and  reached  the  house  of  Mr. 
Allen  by  sun  set,  Avhere  I  preached  in  the  evening  to  a  small 
hut  very  attentive  congregation.  During  the  afternoon  of  the 
folloA\iug  (lay,  1  again  read  prayers  and  preached  at  the  same 
place,  and  being  invited  by  the  people  of  the  adjoining '  Settle- 
ment to  [)ay  tiiem  a  visit,  i  accordingly  did  so,  and  })reaelied  in 
the  evening  at  the  house  of  JNlr.  Mahn-y  :  about  thirty  persons 
as.^embled,  the  greater  i)art  of  whom  wei'e  Presbyterians,  as 
liKi'jed  the  greater  portion  of  the  peojde  in  this  portion  of  the 
vj'vvr  Iiip  are,  except  a  few  Englisli  and  Irish  families  lately 
.  vvt'^  in.  My  reception  among  them  was  particularly  gratify- 
1,,  :'  1  encouraging;  indeed,  I  have  every  reason  to  be  most 
tha..;  f'&gt;l,  for  '^  an  effectual  door"  has  thus  been  opened  to  me, 
not  only  in  this,  but  in  every  quarter  that  I  have  yet  visited. 
God  grant  that  1  may  also  have  grace  to  "  make  known  the 
savour  of  his  knowledge." 

On  Thursday  the  3rd,  I  returned  into  the  front  concession 
of  tl  e  township,  and  in  the  evening  performed  divin'*  service 
and  preached  at  the  dwelling  lious^e  of  Mr.  \Vm.  Brown,  to  a 
numerous  and  very  attentive  congregation,  among  whom  were 
many  Roman  Catiiolics.  The  next  day,  I  returned  into  the 
township  of  Ma'-iuora,  visited  a  sick  member  of  my  congregation,

I  performed  divine  service  and  preached  at  the  house  of  Mr.

buildiuiif  a  Cliurcli,  and  of  inakint^-  provision  for  tiie  maintenance

ITavinf,'  a;_^i;in  roturnod  from  tho  roar  cnncossions of  Ilunfro)- 
ford  and  lliintiii'^'ton,  I  proccedi'd  jilonn-  the  line  of  the  siicoud 
conces.si(jii  of  the  l.-itt-jr  t()\vnslii[),  and  r(;ad  prayers  and  proacliod 
on  tlu^  cvon'n;.;"  of  tlic  Jnd  inst.  at  tlio  lioiiso  of  Mr.  A.  Forstor  ; 
and  tlioii^^h  tho  noLifC  was  short, and  lii(^  wouther  very  uniavour 
able,  about  thirty  i)or«ons  wore  present,  tho  majority  of  whom 
were  ^lothodisis,  and  vtJ'V  nianv  of  them  had  nover  lieard  the 
service  of  the  C'hurcli  betore.  Tlie  person  at  whoso  liouse  ) 
h)di,fed  was  a  mont  piouy,  dovont  man  ;  and  (b.i)in;^'  my  stay  1 
enjoyed  much  pleasing-,  arid  I  liope  edifyin.^"  converf-ation  with 
him  ;  and  J  was  particuhiriy  frvatified  to  hear  him,  early  in  the 
morning  before  1  had  yet  left  my  room,  dispensing'  tho  woid  of 
life  to  his  little  family,  who  seemed  to  listen  with  ^^reat  interest 
;'.ad  attention.  1  was  much  and  forcihly  struck  with  the  scene, 
and  I  c.Liinot  but  Vvjcord  it  as  a  svlihiri/  instance  of  the  kind  I  have 
yet  met  with  ;  indeed,  1  feel  convinced,  that  half  the  wickednes:- 
and  iy\iora;ice  as  to  the  things  of  God  which  prevails  in  this  land, 
may  bo  attributed  to  the  lamentable  deficiency  in  tho  jtarents, 
both  in  regard  to  the  education  of  the  children,  and  tlii^  almost 
universal  neglect  of  family  worshij).  (The  Missiimaiy  r'hoidd 
hav(^  gone  further,  and  traced  the  lamentiible  deiicienty  in  the 
parents  to  its  source — the  utter  destitut'on  in  which  thesr 
i)arents  are  themselves  left  as  to  all  the  outward  means  of  grace, 
or  helps  on  the  part  of  tho  mother  country,  in  the  ways  which 
l(!ad  to  a  religious  life. — Edltur.)  Would  parents  or  heads  of 
families  be  but  kings  and  priests  unto  their  own  household, 
what  ]dessings  might  we  not  expect  ?  for  verily  "  the  Lord  is  in 
the  dwellings  of  tho  righteous." 

On  Saturday  the  .'ii'd,  I  i)roceedod  into  the  township  of 
Thurlow,  and  performed  divine  service  and  preached  in  the 
evening  to  a  large  assembly  of  peoi)le  at  Quaker  School,  in 
the  ninth  concession  of  the  townshii).  Tho  next  morning,  1 
returned  into  the  township  of  Ilvmtington,  and  officiated  again 
at  tho  house  of  Mr.  John  Anderson  ;  but  the  weather  beinu 
excessively  wet  and  stormy,  but  very  few  persons  we»e  presem. 
In  the  afternoon,  I  again  read  prayers  and  preached  to  :i 
numerous  and  most  attentive  conf&gt;regation  at  the  house  of  Mr. 
dure,  in  one  of  the  concessions  of  Kungerford  :  after  the  service 
1  baptized  a  child,  and  gave  notice  for  the  administration  of  the 
Sacrament  of  the  Lord's  Supper  for  the  following  Tuesday. 
T'he  next  morning,  I  proceeded  to  BelleviUe,  for  the  Rev.  Mr. 
Cochran,  who  had  promised  to  assist  me  in  the  administratioii 
of  the  Sacrament,  but  on  my  arrival  there,  I  found  unhappily, 
that  he  had  been  unexpectedly  called  away.  I  was  in  conse- 
quence obliged  to  press  on  as  fi&gt;r  as  the  MohaAvk  ^Mission,  w, 
hopes  of  meeting  with  Mr.  Givins,  in  which  happily  1  succeeded, 
and  he  kindly  consented  to  accompany  me.  Some  time  before 
day  light  next  morning,  we  were  on  our  road,  and  though  it

were  i)re.sent,  many  of  whom  made  tlie  responses  auuibly,  antl 
sun&lt;'*  remarkably  well.  In  the  aftei-noon,  J  jtroceeded  into  tht;

returned  to  tlie  house  of  mv  kind  friend  .Mr.  (iivius,  where  i 
remained  durin|^  the  week,  in  consequence  of  my  own  indisposi- 
tion, as  well  as  on  account  of  my  horse,  which  ,'i;ul  been  seveiely 
injured  in  my  late  journey  into  Jlunqerlbid,  and  which  had  now 
become  unfit  for  i)resent  service.  J  laving  been  myself  directed 
to  keep  quiet  for  a  few  day.s,  3lr.  (livins  kindly  exchanged 
duties  with  me,  and  on.yaturoay  eveniu;^-  officiated  al  the  house 
of  Mr.  Miles  8horey,  Jan.,  in  the  first  concession  of  Camden, 
ai^ain  on  Sunday,  in  the  townshij)  of  Ernest  ToAvn. 

•  On  the  Sunday  followiui^,  by  directions  from  the  ArcJideacon 
of  Kin;,'ston,  I  oliiciated  in  the  Church  at  Bath,  which  had  lately 
become  vacant  ])y  the  sudden  demise  of  the  Kev.  Mr.  Stoiiijhton, 
and  in  the  evening'  of  the  same  day,  1  read  })rayersand  ju'eached 
to  a  veiy  hirge  and  most  attentive  congrc'^ation  assembled  in 
the  .school  house  at  Napannee  !Mills. 

On  Tuesday,  1  proceeded  into  tlio  back'  concessions  of 
Camden,  and  the  next  day  continued  my  jouiney  into  Sheffield. 
Travelliuf^  had  now  become  very  tediims  ;  the  roads  in  many 
[)laces  beiny-  rendered  almost  impassable  by  the  late  iseavy 
1  aiiLS — some  of  the  bi'idges  having  been  carried  away,  and  many 
of  the  causeways  overflowed.  Having,  however,  reached  my 
destination  in  safety  ;  on  the  following  day,  1  visited  a  few  of 
the  neighbouring  families  during  the  day,  and  in  the  evening 
read  prayer,s,  preached,  and  baptized  four  children,  at  the  house 
of  Mr.  Wheeler  :  between  twenty  and  thirty  ])ersons  were 
])resent,  many  of  whom  were  members  of  the  Church.  The 
next  day,  I  continued  my  route  into  the  western  portion  of  the 
i^ame  town.ship,  visited  some  few  families  in  my  w  ay,  and  in  the 
evening  read  prayers  and  lectured  on  bapti.'-m  at  the  house  of 
Mr.  Wm.  M'Kim,  at  whoso  house  I  had  preached  on  my  former 
visit  to  this  township  :  about  thirty  persons  assembled,  and  one 
child  was  baptized.  The  next  day,  I  rodj  in  company  with  Mr. 
Stuart  back  to  the  lakes,  which  form  a  chain  of  very  considerable 
extent,  the  principle  of  which  are  the  Beaver  and  White  liakes  :

as  I  rode  along,  that  I  would  preaeli  in  the  neighbourhood  that

NOVEMBER. 

On  Sunday  the  1st,  I  officiated  in  the  morning  at  the  house 
of  Mr.  Wheeler  again,  in  the  township  of  Camden,  where  1  met 
a  very  large  aiul  attentive  congregation,  consisting  chiefly  of 
Church  people.  After  a  nu)st  tedious  ride  of  about  ten  miles 
through  the  Woods,  I  again  read  prayers  and  preached  Jit  the 
house  of  Mr.  T.  llawlay,  in  the  eighth  concession  of  Camden: 
in  consequence  of  some  delay  in  delivering  the  notice,  as  well 
as  of  the  dieadful  state  of  the  roads,  not  above  thirty  persons 
attended,  very  nuuiy,  if  not  the  chief  part,  were  members  of  the 
Church.  I  learnt  that  part  of  the  Settlers  in  this  i)ortion  of  the 
township  are  natives  of  Ireland,  and  the  most  of  these  either 
members  of  the  Church,  or  favourably  disposed  towards  it. 

A  striking  instance  of  the  baneful  effects  of  superstition 
commanded  my  observation  whilst  in  this  neighbourhood,  in  the 
person  of  an  old  iinin,  who  came  to  me  in  the  utmost  distress  at 
the  conclusion  of  the  service,  to  request  my  opinion  and  advice 
respecting  the  subject  of  departed  spirits  being  allowed  to  visit 
their  friends  on  earth  ;  both  himself  and  his  wife  related  to  me  a 
most  marvellous  account  of  what  they  had  lately  seen  and  heard 
since  the  sudden  death  of  a  brother  of  his,  all  of  which  I  was  at 
first  disposed  to  treat  lightly,  and  to  smile  at  their  foolish  fears  ; 
but  their  fears,  whether  real  or  imaginary,  were  to  them  a  cause 
of  deep  affliction,  for  1  think  I  never  beheld  more  pitiable  objects 
than  these  two  poor  creatures  presented,  as  they  related  to  me 
the  ten'ors  umler  which  they  laboured.  I  endeavoured,  there- 
fore, to  the  best  of  my  power  to  quiet  their  feai-s,  directing  them

that  whilst  imder  the  shadow  of  His  Almighty  wing,  nothing  can

a  show  of  theni  openly."  The  next  morning  I  visited  them  in 
their  skantif,  buried  in  the  very  depths  of  the  wood  ;  they  appeared 
much  rejoiced  to  see  me,  and  being  good  pious  people,  I  spent 
some  considerable  time  with  them,  conversing  on  things  per-

the  sixth  conces'- ion,  where,  in  l!:e  evenin;,^  ot'  tlie  mnie  day,  I 
rc'iid  prayers  and  |&gt;reailied  to  a  small  but  attentive  conj^'rej^ation 
u:  tlu!  scliool  lioase. 

The  next  (hiy  I  oHIciated  twice  in  diiliTcnt  juirts  of  the  same 
toNNUshipand  iiad  very  tolerable  con^i\'^ations  more  particularly 
so  in  the  (;venin;.i^. 

On  Sunday,  oth,  havin;;-  returned   into  the  ei;;Iitii  concession 
of  the  same  town.siiip,  1  read  prayers  and  preacheil  in  the  morn- 
inj^;  to  a  nunu'i'tnis  coii;,'rei(ation  at  the  hous(^  ot'  Mr.  llawluy,  and 
baptized  a  child,     in    tin-  alttrnoon    I   iirrtbnued  (.li\  lnc  service 
and  j)reached  to  a  few  families  at  tl;e  hou;?e  of  Mr.    Uawdh',  in 
the  third  concession,  and  aftei-  service  bapti/.cd  a  &lt;  iiild.     The 
coii&lt;(re&lt;&gt;ation  here  is  usually  lar^e,  the  majority  of  the  people  in 
this  settlement  beiu&lt;y  members  of   the  ChurcJ!,    but  owiiij,'  to 
various  circumsiaiices,  very  many   were  prevcMited  from  coming- 
Hiio   would   otherwise    iiave  t^ladly    atl ended.       Tiie   late   Mr. 
Stroiisi^hton,  dui'iii^-  his  lifetime,  visited  this  station  several  times 
fiom  iJath,  and  (»n  one  or  two  occasions  administered  tlie  Sacra- 
iiuMit  of  tile  Holy  Communion  to  twenty  two  or  three  communi- 
cants.    The  settlement  is  chiefly  composed  of  liish,  with  some 
few  En&lt;(lisli  and  iScotcii  fumilies  :  they  liave  lon&lt;j  laul  the  baildint; 
of  a  Church  in  contemplation,   and  1  have  no  d(jubt,  tiiat  with  ii 
little  exertion  on  the  part  of  the  leadiiif^'  men  at  the  mnt'lihourinir 
villit;4'e  (Clarlv's  mills)   their  purp;;;  e  will  soon   be  caiiiid   into 
etlbct.     The  forenoon  of  the  next  day,  (having  tlu^  prccedinj;- 
evenin;4'  ajj;ain  read  prayeis  and  pieaciied  at  the  school  bouse  at 
Clarli's  mills  to  a  very  larj^e  and  attentive  con&lt;;regation),  I  spent 
ill  the  villaj^e   visiting  from  house   to  house,     'ihe  people  here, 
liki!   tlieir  neighbours    in  the    adjoining    concession,  an;   very 
iiaxious  for  a  Chuich,  and  have  resolved  upon  raising  a  subscrip- 
tion immediately  for  the  puipose ;  the  site  tliey  have  ciioseii  is 
beautifully  situated  on  the  north  side  of  the  Napannei?  liiver,  at 
a  few  iiundred  yards  from  the  village,  and  commands  an  extensive 
view  of  the  surrounding  country.     On  the  condition  of  their  im- 
mediately currying  th.eir  plans  into  o})erati(ni,  1  bave promised  to 
aiake  this  township  my  head  quarters,  and  to  devote  one  third 
of  my  time  exclusively  in  attending  to  it  and  the  adjoining  town- 
ship ^Shetheld.)     In  tiie  afteinoon  of  the  same  day  I  ro(ie  into 
the  sixth  concession  of  Ernest  town,  and  on  tlu&gt;  following  evening 
read  prayers  and  preached  to  a  very  numerous  assemblage  of 
{loople  at  the  Froelick's  .school  house,  on  the  line  betw  een  the 
townships  of  Ernest  town  and  Fredericsburgh.     Tlie  next  day  J 
was  detained  for  scweral  hours   by  a  most  terrific  stoini  of  wind 
and  rain,  but  having  an  appointment  to  fulfil  at  Clark's  mills  in 
the  evening,  I  was  at  length  obliged  to  run  all  i-isks,  and  proceed, 
but  under  the  protecting  hand  of  God,  I  reached  my  destination 
ill  safety,  having  yuilered  no  further  inconvenience  than  those 
iiaturallv  aritini;:  from  ridin'r  two  or  three  hours  in  wet  clothes, 
exposed  to  all  the  fuiy  of  a  keen  easterly  wind. 

In  the  evenini!:  a  few  of  the  neii.rhboiirini&gt;-  families,  and  the 
people  oi  tnt?  village,  assembled  at  the  ft(  hooi  house,  and  1  lectured 
to  them  on  the  Saciament  of  lja])tism.  On  Thursday  tlie  IStli,

On  Sunday,  l.')th,  I  ofliciiited,  in  the  inornin;,^  at  the  Church 
at  Bath, and  in  theeveniiiMfjx'rfornied  divine  siM'viee,  andi)reiieiied 
in  the  I're^hyterian  (Jhureh  at  Hilton,  or  Simon's  mills,  in  the

a  eon^re;fatiuii  of  nhout  a  liwndrt'd  and  twenty  p&lt;'ople  asseinhled. 
On  Mt)nduy  1  continued  my  eour.se  eastward  into  tin*  township 
of  J'oi'tland,  and  in  th(&gt;  evcnin;^M'en&lt;l  pvay(,'is  and  preached  to  a 
very  larjfc  and  attentive  con^jjri'^^ation  at  a  s(dioul  lumse  in  tho 
fourth  eoneession,  one  child  was  l)ai»ti/.ed.  The  next  day  I.  rodo 
into  the  haclvccMicessioiis  of  the  same  'ownship,  and  in  tlu?  evening,' 
read  prayej'sand  lectured  on  IJaptism,  to  a  few  families  assemhled 
at  tilt!  house  of  Mr.  Tli(»s.  Si;^sworth  :  ufttT  service  I  haptized 
eight  children — seven  of  whom  were  mcmheis  of  one  family. 

On  Wt'dnesday,  durinj^  the  morning,  1  visited  two  or  three 
families  in  the  neigliljourhood  and  luiiiti/ed  three  children,  and 
in  the  evening  read  iirayers  and  lectured  on  the  Apostles'  creed 
at  the  house  of  Mr.  Denison,  in  the  eighth  concession  of  the  same 
townshi[)  ;  about  forty  jiersons  &gt;vero  present,  and  two  children 
were  haptized. 

The  following  day  I  returned  to  the  fro;it  part  of  the  town- 
Bliij),  and  visited  several  of  the  neighbouring  families.  Next  day 
after  having  ba])tiz(!d  four  children  at  tho  house  where  1  had 
slept  the  night  before,  1  rode  back  into  tho  western  extremity 
of  the  Huh  concession  ;  there  1  read  jiravors,  preached  and  baj)- 
tized  three  children  in  tho  evening  at  the  house  of  Mv.  Kobert 
Husband. 

Tho  weather,  which  liad  been  very  rainy  all  day,  towards 
night  became  very  boisterous,  and  by  tho  time  service  was  con- 
cluded, had  increased  to  such  a  tremendous  gale,  that  it  became 
dangerous, nay  1  may  say  impracticable  to  get  through  the  woods, 
so  that  very  many  of  my  congregation  were  obliged  to  remain 
till  near  midnight,  when  the  storm  having  abated,  they  wore  en- 
abled to  proceed  to  their  lu)uies,  and  where  I  was  happy  to  find 
next  morning  that  they  all  roached  in  safety.  I  then  proceedf.'d 
forward  into  Loughbro',  whore  on  Sunday  morning,  1  performed 
divine  service  and  i)reached  to  a  largo  congregation  at  tho 
Methodist  meeting  house,  near  Mr.  KussoH's  mills,  two  children 
wore  ba])tizod  on  this  occasion.  In  tho  afternoon  of  the  same 
day  1  read  prayers  and  preached  at  tho  school  house  in  tl 
fourth  concession  of  Portland,  from  one  hundred  and  ten  to  one 
hundred  and  twenty  persons  wore  present,  a  great  part  of  whom 
were  Church  people.  In  the  evening  1  again  read  prayers  and 
preached  to  a  few  families  assembled  at  tho  school  house,  on  tho 
second  concession  of  Portland,  near  the  house  of  T.  Shibley,  Esq. 
M.P.P.  Much  snow  having  fallen  during  tho  night  on  Sunday, 
and  tJio  weather  having  become  so  cold  as  to  render  travelling

Thi!  /olio  id  Hi  I  /V  /tilmiittfd  hi/  the  Contmittt'i',  in  tlnir  fifth  Ixifmrt,  f  ivji'. 
\i\,Hf  a  ftliort  itiitHiii'  of'  irhdt  Mr.  Hitr/'iir  rowcc/n-jt  to  be  the  ffiiritmtl 
inmlK  df'thi'  M'liJIiiiiil  /)'it!trirt,  in  reK/net  to  Ch  rijiiinen. 

In  tile  first  plafo  then,  I  wouhl  oliscrvo,  that  the  number  of 
Kpisi'opiilians,  scattered   through  the  district,  far  exceeded  my 
expectations  ;  tin  y  ai"«»  nunu'rous  in  must  of  the  townsliips,  and 
in  some  are  (h-cidcdly  the  nuijoi'ity.     Jn   soveral  parts  of  the 
district,   niimbers   of  them    have   been    induced    to   leave   our 
oomnuMiion,  and  to   join  other  denominations,  solely  from  being 
unable  to  obtain  the   ministtations  of    their  own  ;    but  whero 
this  has  been  tlu;  case,  they  ahnost  inviiriably  ri'tain  a  jjartiality 
to  their  mother  ('hurch,  and    rejoice  in    every  op]&gt;()rtunity  of 
again  ])articipating  in   her  services.     Many  too,  who  have  ha&lt;l 
their  children  baptized  by  the  Methodist  pi'eachers  and  ministers 
of  other  denominations,  have  brought  their  children  to  \\u\  to  bo 
re-bapti/ed  ;  and  with  my  brother  Missionary,  Mr.  Klliot,  I  may 
observe,  as  an  evidence  of  the  firm  attaclnnent  which  many  have 
to  the  C/hurch  of  their  forefathers,  and  of  the  anxious  desire 
they  cherish  of  again  enjoying  her  ministrations,   \   have  lia&lt;l 
persons  come  not  only   ten   mih^s,  but    no   less  than  fifti'cn  or 
twenty,  and  that  in  rainy  weather,  through  the  woods,  to  attend 
my  services.     JJut  I  nuiy  here  observe  also,  that  these  ])erson.s 
of  whom  1  speak  Avere  Europeans,  who  have  been  brought  up  in 
the  bosom  of  the  Church  ;    thiur  children,  however,  can  scarcely 
be  expected   to  retain    the  same  affection    and    attachment  ; 
indeed,  under  existing  circumstances,  it  would  be  folly  to  look 
for  it — how  can  they  love  that  which  they  have  not  seen,  and  of 
which  they  know  nothing.    This  may  itself  be  sufHcient  to  shew, 
in  some  degree,  the  necessity  of  an  increase  of  labourers  in  this 
portion   of  the   Lord's  vineyard.      But   I   would    yet    further 
remark,  that  the  prejudices  which  we  daily  meet  with,  as  well 
as   the  objections   which   are  continually    raised    against    tho 
Church,  arise   in   a  great  measure,  if  not  entirely,  from    the 
ignorance  which  prevails,  both  with  regard  to  her  doctrine  and 
practice.    So  strikingly  is  this  tho  case  in  this  district,  that  I 
have  had  it  frequently  remarked  to  me,  after  officiating  in  mixed 
congregations,  "  Why  Sir,  you  pj-each  the  same  truths  as  wo  do 
—after  all  there  can  l)o  no  essimtial  difference  between  ns,"  and 
many  other  similar  observations.     1  need  not,  however,  multiply 
evidences  of  the  spiritual  wants  of  the  district  committed  by  tho 
Society  to  my  charge,  and  of  the  loud  calls  which  resound  from 
every  corner  of  it,  for  men  who  shall  be  "  apt  to  teach,  patient, 
in  meekness  instructing  those  that  oppose  themselves."    The 
excellent  remarks  by  Mr.  Elliot,  (published  in  the  fourth  report 
of  the  Toronto  Society,  pages  Gl,  &amp;c.,  and  rein-inted  in  England, 
spring,  1836,  published  by  llatchard  and  Son,)  apply  eqnally  to 
this  district,  though  the  number  of  Episcopalians  is  at  present 
infinitely    smaller.       The    number    of   Clergymen,    therefore,

FIRST  LETTER  FROM  THE  REV.  R.  FLOOD, 

Bdating  to  the  Indians  on  the  Thames  Hirer. 
•.'«';  Caradoc,  Sept.  4, 1835. 

ADDRESSED    TO    THE    BISHOP   OF    QUEBEC. 

My  Lord, — It  is  now  better  than  two  inontlis  since  I  first 
commenced  visiting  the  Bear  Creek  and  Monsee  Indians,  who 
are  as  yet  in  a  heathen  state,  residing  on  the  banks  of  the  river 
Thames  in  the  extreme  part  of  this  township  ;  I  was  principally 
induced  to  try  my  own  efforts  from  the  circumstance  of  their 
unwillingness  to  join  the  Methodists,  who  are  established  among 
some  Indians  about  four  miles  distant  from  those  I  now  allude  tu. 

I  have  now  the  unspeakable  delight  to  inform  you  that  my 
humble  services  have  been  crowned  with  success  so  far,  that  I 
have  gained  their  attention,  and  that  they  are  now  attending 
my  Ministry  statedly  every  alternate  Sabbath,  on  wiiich  I  have 
to  preach  twice,  as  their  languages  are  quite  distinct.  On  last 
Sabbath  there  were  between  forty  and  fifty  in  attendance  ;  and 
their  demeanour  altogethe**  was  marked  with  attention  and 
reverencej  which  from  pure  Pagans  may  be  considered  extra 
ordinary — so  that  I  am  inclined  to  p'uck  up  courage  and  go  on 
in  the  strength  of  the  Lord. 

But  there  are  two  great  wants  I  feel. 

First,  the  want  of  a  well  qualified  interpreter. 

Secondly,  the  want  of  some  portion  of  our  liturgy  in  the 
(yhippewa  tongue.  I  am  not  aware  that  there  is  such  a  transla- 
tion in  existence,  but  surely  the  expence  could  not  be  great  in 
•letting  the  Morning  Service  with  some  Psalms  and  Hymns,  and 
the  Gospels,  translated  for  the  purpose.  This  I  would  under- 
take to  do  myself  in  a  very  short  time,  if  I  had  a  good  interpreter. 
Here  is  a  field  of  a  most  interesting  description  open  before  me, 
and  what  a  pity  !  ! !  if  we  cannot  procure  the  me8.is  of  Attaching 
lliese  ])oor,  but  willing  to  be  instructed  heatheus,  to  our  vener- 
able Church.  I  could  wish  also  that  I  had  a  little  shanty  to  live 
in  among  them,  say  two  days  in  a  fortnight,  where  my  presence 
in  visiting  them,  from  wigwam  to  wigwam,  would  have  an 
additional  eff'^ct,  besides  that  it  would  aid  me  so  much  in 
acquiring  a  knowledge  of  their  language,  so  as  to  be  soon  able 
to  preach  to  them  in  their  own  tongue  the  wondcriul  works  of 
God.  Were  your  Lordship  at  my  elbow  for  a  few  days  I  am 
sure  that  no  exertion  would  be  wanting,  and  no  step  lOiV  untried 
on  your  part  to  promote  tiieae  two  grand  objects  which  I  have 
so  much  at  heart  in  regard  to  these  poor  Indians.  As  to  the  rest 
of  my  extensive  charge,  I  have  always  evening  service  at  my 
own  place  every  Sabbath,  which  is  very  well  atl&lt;  nded — indeed 
onr  h  )use  h  sc  small  that  ve  cannot  well  accommodate  more  than 
thirty  in  the  room.  On  the  alternate  Sundays  1  attend  at  the 
village  of  Delaware,  v.  here  our  congregation  has  exceeded  my 
most  sanguine  expectation-).  Since  our  new  Church  was  opened 
for  divine  service,  the  usual  attendance,  when  the  weather 
permits,  is  from  seventy  to  more  than  a  hundred.  I  have  also 
established  a  Day  and  Sunday  School,  which  are  prospering  ; 
the  attendance  of  children  amounts  to  thirty.

I  tthould  have  visited  Chatham  before  this,  but  found  my 
hands  so  full  of  work  hero,  that  I  was  unwilling  to  disappoint 
any  of  the  conj^egations  I  have  formed — besides  Chatham  is  forty 
eight  miles  from  me,  and  I  cannot  afford  to  be  at  more  expence 
than  I  feel  I  am  at  present  subject  to.  With  my  present 
engagements,  familv,  and  two  servants  (man  and  woman),  and 
keeping  also  a  few  horses  (less  could  not  go  through  the  work  I 
have  fi&gt;r  them),  I  cannot  cover  my  expences  at  less  than  £200 
per  annum.  Tlie  inhabitants  of  this  place  are  really  so  poor 
themselves,  that  I  do  not  expect  one  penny  from  them,  and  I 
Bjn  consequently  eating  away  my  little  capital  and  cannot  h.elp 
it,  and  I  greatly  fear  when  that  is  gone  I  must  become  either  a 
bankrupt,  go  to  jail,  or  return  to  the  wars  and  woes  of  Ireland  ; 
but  "Tribulation  worketh  patience,  and  patience  experience, 
and  experience  hope,"  and  I  strive  to  trust  that  the  Lord  of  all 
these  gifts  will  do  what  seemeth  him  good,  and  finally  over-rule 
all  to  his  own  praise  and  glory.  I  have,  in  conclusion,  to  express 
my  sincere  thanks  for  your  present  of  the  Catechisms,  and  have

SECOND  LETTER  FROM  THE  REV.  R.  FLOOD, 

Missionary  at  Delaware  and  Caradoc^  by  whose  exertions  the  Beer  Creek 
Indians,  upon  the  river  Thaanes,  in  the  Western  District  of  Upper 
Canada,  have  been  brought  to  the  knowledye  and  profession  of  the 
Christian  Faith.  The  Letter  is  addressed  to  the  Hon,  and  Might 
'  Rev.  Charles  James,  Lord  Bishop  of  Quebec,  and  is  dated  Caradoc, 
June  loth,  1836. 

My  Lord, — When  I  had  the  pleasure,  some  time  ago,  of 
communicating  to  your  Lordship  the  spiritual  state  of  this  mis- 
sion, and  its  increased  extension,  by  engaging  the  attention  of 
the  Bear  Creek  Indians,  on  the  Thames  River,  I  had  before  mo 
the  rough  work  of  dealing  with  man  in  his  most  uncivilized,  and 
consequently  demoralized  state  tliat  we  can  possibly  conceive. 
I  continued,  however,  preach  unto  them  regularly  every  alter- 
nate Sabbath,  from  the  early  part  of  last  year,  to  the  present 
time.  Their  attendance  has  now  become  regular  and  systematic, 
and  they  are  decidedly  attached  to  our  venerable  Church.  On 
Sabbath  last,  which  was  my  turn  to  preach  to  them  at  the  Indian 
village,  I  took  five  hours  to  walk  there.  Starting  early  in  the 
morning,  but  having  to  walk  through  a  densely  entangled  forest 
by  an  Indian  footpath,  jumping  from  one  fallen  tree  to  another 
to  avoid  swamps  and  mudholes,  devoured  by  mosquitoes,  and 
under  a  burning  sun,  it  was  noon  before  I  arrived,  though  the 
distance  is  only  twelve  miles.  This  additional  hardship  and 
difficulty  has  befallen  me  in  consequence  of  the  foundering  of 
my  horse,  which  happened  some  time  ago,  since  which  time  he 
has  been  useless  to  me,  without  a  prospect,  in  my  reduced  cir- 
cumstances, of  repairing  the  loss.  The  attendance  of  the  Indians 
with  their  chiefs,  and  wives  and  children,  was  upon  a  large  scale. 
After  divine  service  I  attended  a  Sunday-school  which  I  have 
established.  I  am  obliged  to  use  signs  and  gestures  as  yet  to 
make  myself  intelligible  to  the  chilai'en,  with  such  little  of  the

Chi,*pewa  language  as  I  have  been  able  to  acquire.  I  remained 
over  the  niglit,  sleeping  on  the  hard  floor  of  a  wigwam,  for  the 
purpose  of  holding  a  meeting  on  the  following  day.  Monday, 
agreealdy  to  their  request  convoyed  to  mo  during  the  preced- 
ing week,  which  was,  that  I  should  take  down  their  names,  and 
receive  tlieir  most  solemji  promise  in  ilic  ;»»*»&gt;sence  of  Almighty 
God  to  abstain  from  d -inking,  I  attended  them,  and  having  done 
as  they  wished,  I  prayed  for  a  blessing  on  the  good  work,  and 
then  prejiched  to  them  from  the  latter  ])ai't  of  the  fifth  chapter 
of  traUitians,  shewing  wliat  are  the  works  of  the  iiesh,  and  to 
what  they  must  inevitabled  lead  if  continued  in,  as  well  as  the 
contrast,  the  fruits  of  the  Spirit.  Your  Lordship  is  aware  that 
tlie  Indian  character  and  temperament  is  such  that  temperance 
with  him  is  quite  out  of  the  question,  for  if  he  tastes  but  the 
smallest  quantity  of  spirits,  he  cannot  resist  the  temptation  of 
taking  more,  and  getting  himself  intoxicated  ;  thereiore  total 
abstinence  is  the  only  specific  from  this  sad  propensity.  Of 
course  I  do  not  mean  to  say  that  this  is  the  character  of  the  con- 
verted and  civilized  Indian,  but  I  speak  of  him  only  in  his  un- 
converted and  uncivilized  condition.  1  can,  even  now,  though 
the  time  has  been  comparatively  short,  rejoice  over  a  few 
who  have  given  up  altogether  their  "  waubenois,"  the  Indian 
saturnalia. 

I  send  your  Lordship  herewith  a  letter  from  my  Indian 
schoolmaster,  whicli  I  am  sure  will  pi-ove  both  acceptable  and 
interesting  to  you,  as  it  shews  in  so  plain  a  light,  that  an  im- 
pression, to  a  very  considerable  degree,  has  already  been  made 
upon  the  minds  of  this  interesting  clas.i  of  human  beings.  As 
my  Indian  mission  begins  nov/  to  wear  a  cheering  aspect,  I  mean, 
under  the  Divine  assistance,  to  ride  occasionally  among  them. 
I  have  already  commenced  the  building  of  a  small  Mission 
House  on  my  own  responsibility.  I  expect  a  little  aid  from 
some  Christian  friends  in  Ireland  towards  this  work,  the  entire, 
when  finished,  will  not,  I  expect,  exceed  one  Innidred  pounds. 
I  feel  convinced  from  your  Lordship's  w  onted  lilxrality  and  well 
known  interest  in  missionary  enteri)rize  Hat  if  there  be  any 
disposable  funds  in  your  hands,  my  appea  &gt;  vou  will  not  be  in 
vain,  but  as  I  have  before  stated  my  greatest  present  difticnlty, 
and  one  which  affects  the  mission  most,  is  the  prcs'^i  ^  want  of 
a  horse.  If  your  Lordship  could  equip  me  with  one,  a-^  I  am 
now  entirely  dismounted,  you  would  confer  a  great  fa\  our  on 
me,  and  on  the  mission  generally,  as  I  suffer  exceedingly  in  such 
long  journeys  on  foot,  during  this  warm  weather  particularly, 
between  Delawai'e  and  the  Indian  villages,  and  at  present  my 
extroiiiely  reduced  circumstan(;es  cannot  afford  the  purchast- 
even  of  a  much  more  trifling  article.  Hoping  soon  to  be 
favoured  with  a  line,  I  remain,  &amp;c.  R.  F.

INDIAN  SCHOOLMASTER'S  LETTER  ENCLOSED. 

Colhoiirn  on  Thames,  April  26th,  1836. 

Rev.  Sir, — I  am  happy  in  transmitting  the  following  for 
vonr  consideration.  'Ilie  Bear  Creek  Indians  of  the  Chippewa 
'rribe  have  met  in  council,  and  have  covie  to  this  conclusion, 
that  they  will  be  Pagans  no  longer ;  thoy  are  very  anxious  to 
have  you  give  them  your  attendance  the  earliest  possible  oonvt  - 
nience.  I'hey  will  expect  to  see  you  next  Sunday,  if  it  will  not 
interfere  with  prior  arrangements.  Your  answer  by  return  of 
bearer  will  j.; reatly  oblige  them.  This  is  the  second  message 
which  they  have  sent. — I  am,  &amp;c.

REV.  R.  FLOOD'S  ACKNOWLEDGMENT. 

;'  '  Dated  Caradoc,  Jidy  23r(/,  1836. 

My  Dear  Sir, — I  have  drawn  upon  Mr.  Ridoult  for  the 
sum  his  Lordship  was  pleased  to  grant  me,  and  feel  grateful 
for  his  kind  attention  to  my  request,  and  equally  so  to  your- 
self, as  the  channel  through  which  the  kindness  flowed.  My 
Indian  mission  has  now  assumed  all  the  interest  which  arises 
from  love  and  cordi.al  attachment  to  me,  on  the  part  of  the 
Indians,  as  their  minister  ;  and  it  is  a  pleasing  reflection  that  so 
many  are  already  attached  to  our  venerable  Church.  Now  tliat 
so  much  has  been  done,  we  mixst,  under  the  Divine  assistance, 
endeavour  to  provide  for  their  spiritual  wants.  I  have  suc- 
ceeded in  one  or  two  of  my  applications  to  my  Christian  friends 
on  the  other  side  of  the  Atlantic,  in  raising  a  small  sum  towards 
building  my  Mission  House  among  them,  where  I  propose  to 
spend  a  part  of  my  time  for  their  benefit,  as  well  as  to  acquire 
my.*:olf  such  knowledge  of  the  Chippewa  language  as  may  enable 
me  to  preach  to  these  poor  people,  "  in  their  own  tongue  the 
wonderful  works  of  God,  and  the  unsearchable  riches  of  Christ."

THIRD  LETTER  FROM  THE  REV.  R.  FLOOD. 

MISSION  TO    THE    MONSEE   AND  BEAR  CREEK  CHIPPEWA  INDIANS, 
UPON  THE  THAMES  RIVER,  NJHAR  LAKE  ST.  CLAIR. 

The  first  and  second  Letters  from  Mr.  Flood,  to  the  late  Risliop  of 
Quebec,  have  been  printed,  in  the  reports  circulated,  as  receired  from 
the  Bishop  of  Quebec.  The  third  received  by  W.  J.  D.  W.,  since  his 
Lordship's  death,  follows. 

Caradoc,  luar  Delaware,  August  2,  1837. 
Reverend  Sir, — I  tsteem  it  a  privilege  to  be  permitted  to 
open  a  communication  with  those  friends  of  my  dear  and  highly 
valued  Bishop,  who,  under  God,  have  been  the  honoured  instru- 
ment of  aiding  him  in  doing  much  for  the  propagation  of  the 
Gospel  in  this  bleak  howling  wilderness,  as  I  have  been  lately 
informed  by  your  faithful  and  devoted  Missionary,  Mr.  Green. 
Ho  has  just  paid  a  visit  to  my  Indian  Mission,  and  he  signified 
to  me  the  kind  and  christian  concern  of  you    ;?lf  and  friends  for

Inds  for 


the  best  interests  of  the  poor  Indians,  and  also  your  request  of 
learning  some  particulars  iu  reference  to  this  long  neglected 
race  of  human  beinf»s. 

Our  hi&lt;?hly  valued  and  truly  pious  Bishop  gave  me  to  under- 
stand shortly  after  my  arrival  in  Upper  Canada,  that  he  would 
give  his  sanction  to  my  appointment  in  any  part  of  the  province 
that  I  might  select  as  a  Missionary  Station.  After  labouring  as 
a  Missionary  throughout  a  considerable  portion  of  this  country, 
preaching  the  words  of  eternal  life  whenever  an  opportunity  pre- 
sented itself;  I  was  at  length  induced  to  select  Caradoc  as  my  head 
quarters,  being,  in  my  judgment,  the  darkest  and  most  benighted 
corner  in  the  province,  where  somo  hundreds  of  poor  children 
of  the  forest  have  been,  from  time  immemorial,  perishing  from 
lack  of  knowledge,  and  none  to  offer  them  the  bread  of  life.  It 
has  been  matter  of  surprise  and  astonishment  to  me,  since  it  has 
pleased  the  Most  High  to  open  a  door  of  utterance  among  them, 
that  these  precious  souls,  for  whom  also  Jesus  bled,  should  have 
been  so  long  overlooked  by  the  many  and  various  societies, 
whose  object  is  the  glory  of  God,  and  the  salvation  of  sinners. 
I  have  had  many  difficulties  to  contend  with  in  my  incipient 
endeavours  to  arrest  their  attention,  and  bring  them  under  tlie 
merciful  yoke  of  Gospel  light  and  truth,  which  you  can  see  more 
at  large  by  referring  to  the  Dublin  Record  of  December  I'ith  and 
I5tli,  183G.  I  gave  a  valuable  friend  and  brother,  the  Rev.  Mr. 
Minchin,  permission  to  publish  such  extracts  from  my  Journal,  as 
might  not  only  interest  the  christian  public,  but  might  tend  to 
create  some  fund,  wliereby  I  might  be  enabled  to  promote  the  good 
work  iu  this  varied  sphere  of ,  labour  ;  I  have,  however,  had  no 
assistance  from  that  quarter,  and  co  ticlude  that  my  friend  has  not 
been  able  to  accomplish  the  object  in  view.  The  only  assistance  I 
have  to  acknowledge  is  £30  from  my  invaluable  Bishop  (part  of 
your  funds),  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing  a  horse,  in  July, 
1836  ;  and  £')0  granted  by  the  New  England  Company,  with  a 
proviso  that  I  was  not  to  look  for  further  aid  from  them,  in 
consequence  of  the  limited  fund  the  company  possessed.  This 
sum  I  appropriated  towards  building  a  Mission-house  among  the 
Indians,  which  still  remains  in  nn  unfinished  state  for  want  of 
funds  to  complete  it,  and  which,  of  course,  if  uncompleted  must 
soon  go  to  decay.  The  house  (a  plan  which  the  Bishop  approved 
if  I  could  raise  the  means,)  would  have  enabled  me  to  remain 
the  entire  of  every  alternate  week  in  the  Settlement,  and  would 
thereby  have  facilitated  the  grand  object  of  evangelizing  the 
tribes,  as  well  as  maturing  my  acquisition  of  the  Chippewa 
language,  so  as  to  declare  to  them  in  tlieir  o^^ti  tongue,  wherein 
they  were  born,  the  wonderful  works  of  the  J  iOxd. 

The  means  of  living  among  them  cannot  however  be  obtained 
without  great  expence,  as  there  is  no  cart  or  waggon  road  leading 
to  the  village,  and  every  article  in  the  way  of  provisions  must 
be  conveyed  the  distance  of  from  twelve  to  twenty  miles  either 
on  horseback,  or  by  the  Thames  River  in  canoes.  I  suffer  more 
than  I  can  describe  in  visiting  them  from  Caradoc  every  other 
Sunday,  and  occasionally  on  week  days,  particularly  during  this 
wp  A  weather  ;  as  I  can  only  ride  half  the  way,  and  must  then 
walk  the  remaiuder  by  an  Indian  path,  through  a  very  close  and

tangled  fun;st,  wading  through  Kwainps,  in  Nome  places  up  to  my 
■'  knees,  dnvoured  by  an  army  of  nnisquitoes  the  entire  way,  so 
that  my  liands  and  face  became  dreadfully  swollen  and  blistered 
— together  with  the  danger  of  encountering  the  rattlesnakes,  &amp;c. 
whicli  abound  in  this  pathless  wilderness.  After  I  have  preached 
to  the  two  tribes,  the  Monsees  and  Bear  Creek  Chippewas,  it  is 
80  far  advanced  in  the  day,  that  I  have  repeated  hairbreadth 
escapes,  and  am  not  unfrequently  beiiightod  before  I  can  emerge 
from  tlie  forest,  sometimes  not  reaching  home  till  after  ten  at 
night.  The  average  congregation  at  the  Indian  Church  is  from 
fifty  to  an  hundred  souls  ;  over  whom  I  can  rejoice,  "  as  accepted 
in  the  beloved,"  who  not  only  profess  Him  as  their  "  all  in  all," 
but  who  walk  worthy  of  their  high  vocation. 

Halfmoon,  Snake,  and  Hoftj  of  the  Monsees,  not  only  love 
the  truth  as  it  is  in  Jesus,  but  are  most  useful  auxiliaries  to  my 
labours  among  their  people  :  one  acts  as  interpreter,  the  other 
two  as  exhorters.  Ten  of  their  children  can  read  tolerably,  and 
four  have  committed  the  Church  Catechism  to  memory.  These 
are  pleasing  instances  to  record  ;  and  surely  when  we  reflect  on 
the  inestimable  value  of  one  soul,  wo  shall  form  but  a  low 
estimate  of  the  labours  and  difficulties  and  sacrifices  to  preserve 
it ;  knowing  that  a  bright  day  will  come,  when  our  "  works  and 
labour  of  love,"  l^hjugh  there  be  much  weakness  in  them,  shall 
be  more  than  amply  repaid — and  will  not  be  forgotten  by  Him 
who  raaketb  "  the  outgoing  of  the  morning  and  evening  to  praise 
him." 

Could  a  permanent  salary,  adequate  to  the  support  of  a 
resident  Missionary  be  procured,  much  good,  under  the  Divine 
blessing,  would  inevitably  result.  My  Indians  are  now  so 
attached  to  our  venerable  Church,  that  it  were  a  pity  to  desert 
them,  especially  as  they  will  not  listen  to  ministers  of  any  other 
denomination,  much  less  join  in  communion  with  them.  I  feai 
I  shall  not  be  able  to  continue  my  services  much  longer  among 
them  for  want  of  the  means  of  support — the  little  capital  which 
I  brought  out  having  been  entirely  expended  in  the  service — 
were  the  kind  and  christian  efforts  of  your  friends  enlisted  in 
their  behalf,  something  may  yet  be  done  to  save  this  interesting 
Mission,  an  anxious  object  to  my  dear  lost  Bishop,  from 
languishing  and  dying  away.  I  shall  be  most  happy  in  not  only 
furnishing  you  with  every  information  connected  with  them, 
but  with  copious  extracts  from  my  journal.  Pray,  present  my 
kindest  christian  regards  to  that  man  of  God,  my  beloved  Bishop  ; 
and  may  his  end  be  peace  when  his  sun  goes  down. 

I  remain,  Reverend  Sir, 

Your  obedient  servant,

couragement in  one  part  of  this  uiisNJon,  where  1  had  established 
a  regular  station,  for  the  exercise  of  my  ministry,  once  every 
fortnight,  adjoining  the  township  of  Ekfrid.  1  dare  say,  the 
novelty  of  seeing  and  hearing  a  missionary  of  the  Church  of 
England  for  the  first  time,  attracted  many  in  the  neigiibourhood, 
who  hitherto,  as  far  as  I  can  learn,  never  enjoyed  the  ordinances 
of  any  Church,  or  the  privileges  which  the  Sabbath  presents,  as 

Erized  in  more  favoured  lands.  Their  attendance  at  this  place 
ad  80  fallen  off  after  regular  visits  on  my  i)art  for  twelvemonths, 
that,  on  one  occasion,  having  seen  only  a  few  of  them  assembled 
in  a  barn  (this  being  the  Churcli  pro.  tem.)  I  took  the  opportu- 
nity, after  divine  service,  of  acquainting  them,  that  if  twelve 
of  their  families  agi-eed  to  assemble  statedly,  and  promised  me 
to  that  effect,  I  would  feel  it  my  duty  to  continue  my  visits  to 
them,  but  as  I  did  not  receive  any  such  proposal,  I  thenceforth 
determined  through  the  Divine  aid,  to  visit  the  Pagan  Indians 
settled  on  tlie  Thames,  about  seven  miles  distant  from  that 
place,  and  to  give  them  a  similar  trial  at  least  for  the  same 
period  of  time.  But  here  I  would  remark,  that  the  settlei-s  in 
the  above  quarter  embraced  only  a  few  Church  of  England 
persons,  and  those,  alas  !  appear  to  me  so  lost  to  all  semblance, 
much  more  sense  of  religion,  that  they  really  outstript  their  no- 
professing  Yankee  neighbours  in  every  thing  that  evinces  a 
bankruptcy  in  religion.  I  do,  indeed,  recognize  the  hand  of  the 
Most  High  in  directing  my  steps  to  the  poor  untutored  Indians, 
by  whom,  on  my  first  visit,  I  was  well  received.  They  immedi- 
ately met  and  gave  me  an  audience, — their  inisophisticated 
minds  being  as  yet  free  from  the  grosser  vices  of  the  ungodly 
white  people.  Their  superintendent,  Col.  Clynch,  had  previously 
informed  me,  that  in  his  opinion,  they  would  never  join  any 
of  the  American  Sectaries,  as  these  had  often  tried  to  effect  it, 
and  that  if  they  would  listen  to  any,  he  must  be  a  minister  of  the 
Church,  which  their  great  Father,  the  King,  professes. 

June  5th,  1836. — Walked  to  the  Indian  village  distant 
twelve  miles  from  my  residence,  as  I  had  no  horse  of  my  own, 
and  could  neither  hire  or  borrow  one  in  my  neighbourhood. 
The  first  three  or  four  miles  lay  throiigh  a  settled  part  of  the 
countiy,  before  I  turn  into  the  uninhabited  forest ; — spoke  to  a 
person  as  he  was  washing  clothes  in  a  stream  of  water  opposite 
his  dwelling,  of  the  sin  he  was  committing  in  breaking  the  sab- 
bath. This  man  and  family  never  attended  public  worship,  but 
this  sad  neglect  of  the  means  of  grace,  and  consequently  the 
demoralized  state  of  the  Settlers  generally,  is  become  the  crying 
sin  of  this  part  of  the  province  in  particular.  Called  to  see  two 
other  families,  who  were  equally  indifferent  to  the  subject  of 
true  religion  as  their  neighbours — warned  them  of  approaching 
displeasure  of  Him  with  whom  they  will  have  to  do  ere  long,  and 
entreated  them  to  flee  from  the  wrath  to  come  by  believing  in  the 
Lord  Jesus  Christ,  whom  the  father  hath  Sont  to  deliver  his  people 
from  sin,  death,  and  judgment.    They  seemed  thankful ;  but  I

(lare  known  thorn  to  he  both  graceless  and  thoughtless  on  theso 
important  concerns.  It  niiust  appear  extraordinary  and  passing 
stranfje  to  a  well-ordered  Hociety,  wlio  can  appreciate  ChriHtiaii 
j)rivil(!ges,  tliat  out  of  forty  families  located  in  this  part  of  the 
townshi]),  only  one  attends  divine  worsiiip  in  the  village  of 
Delaware.  Arrived  at  IMoiisec  about  noon,  having  taken  five 
hours  to  accomplish  the  journey,  the  day  was  also  remarkably 
hot.  The  Indians,  as  ususl,  with  their  chiefs,  were  assembled 
neatly  dressed  in  their  showy  garments,  and  listened  with  the 
greatest  attention  to  my  discourse.  J'reached  from  John  xiv.  15, 
showed  them  the  source  of  all  love,  in  the  grand  scheme  of  Re- 
deeming love,  tile  in-dwelling  of  the  blessed  Spirit  in  all  the  Lord's 
j)0ople,  one  prominent  feature  or  proof  of  which  was  love,  so 
that  the  hearts  of  all  his  justified  and  sanctified  ones  should  be 
as  '"le  heart  of  one  man  ;  besought  them  most  earnestly  to 
seek  the  Lord  wliile  he  may  be  found,  and  to  pray  for  his 
Spirit.  O  may  the  love  of  Christ  inHuence  all  their  hearts  ! 
Afterwards  attended  a  Sunday-school  I  have  lately  established 
among  them — to  the  little  ones  I  have  to  use  signs  and  gestures 
as  auxiliaries  to  a  little  smattering  of  Chippewa,  which  I  have 
acquired  to  convey  my  meaning. 

I  remained  over  night,  sleeping  on  the  hard  floor  of  a  wig- 
wam, for  the  purpose  of  holding  a  jneeting  next  day  agi'eeably 
to  their  wishes,  as  comnmnicated  to  me  in  the  course  of  the  past 
week,  wliich  is  to  write  down  their  names,  and  to  promise  most 
solemnly  on  their  i)art  to  give  up  the  use  of  ardent  spirits  for 
one  month,  which  I  gladly  encouraged  and  readily  complied 
with,  as  this  sad  indulgence  in  strong  drink  has  become  the 
besetting  sin  of  the  American  Indians,  as  well  as  of  too  many  of 
the  white  popidation,  from  whom  they  have  derived  this  grand 
curse.  After  having  in  the  first  place  prayed  for  a  blessing  upon 
this  giacious  step  they  were  about  takmg,  I  preached  from  Gal. 
V.  14,  15,  showing  what  are  the  works  of  the  flesh,  and  what  they 
must  lead  to  if  persevered  in — eternal  death,  as  well  as  the 
contrast,  the  fruits  of  the  Spirit ;  urged  upon  them  the  necessity 
of  living  in  the  exercise  of  those  blc:ised  fruits,  by  tlie  considera- 
tion of  the  shortness  of  time  and  the  approaching  judgment. 
During  the  delivery  of  my  discourses,  they  invariably  mark  their 
assent  by  the  hoarse  gutteral  sound  (augh),  which  signifles  yes, 
or  amen.  1  must  here  remark,  that  the  Indian  chai'acter  is  such, 
that  temperance  with  him  is  out  of  the  question,  for  if  lie  but 
once  tastes  the  smallest  quantity  of  spirits,  he  cannot  resist  tiie 
temptation  of  indulging  in  more,  until  he  becomes  completely 
intoxicated — therefore  total  abstinence  is  the  only  sjjeciflc  for 
this  propensity.  I  am  far  from  meaning  that  this  is  tlie  case  of 
the  civilized  and  converted  ;  far  from  it.  I  can  even  now  rejoice 
over  some  wlio  have  altogether  given  up  for  some  time  their 
(waubenois)  the  Indian  saturnalia.  The  resolution  they 
adoped  was  to  tlie  following  effect  : — 

At  a  meeting  of  the  Bear  Creek,  Chiefs  of  the  Chippewa, 
as  well  as  the  Chiefs  of  the  Monsee  nations,  with  their  people, 
held  in  their  school-house  and  (wig-a-wam  kesh-e-monnedoon) 
house  of  God,  at  Old  Monsee,  on  the  Thames,  this  6th  day  of 
June,  1836:—  ,     .

"  That  wo  believe  that  the  fire-wator  (spirits)  of  the  'whito 
men  is  very  bad  for  our  bodies  and  souls,  and  that  we  and  our 
people  will  strive  to  bo  sober,  and  to  obey  our  father  (i.  e.  me) 
m  all  he  tells  us,  that  the  Great  Spirit  has  spoken  in  his  book." 

As  each  gave  his  cordial  assent  to  this  measure,  I  requested 
that  they  might  also  declare  the  same  before  the  assemblage  in 
their  own  language,  in  the  accompanying  words  :— •"  May  God 
give  me  the  great  and  good  and  holy  Hpirit,  to  fight  against  sin, 
for  the  sake  of  .lestis  Christ  our  liord."  .lohn  Fairchild,  school- 
master ;  tFames  (iroesbeak,  Chippewa  interpreter  ;  Kanoting, 
head  chief  Misco-comon  ;  Chief  Charlo,  ditto ;  Kaube-Ketung, 
ditto  ;  Memtegosh,  chief  captain,  fox  fighting  chief  ;  Kezis- 
swabah  Kaukaubin,  of  the  Chippewas ;  Captain  Snake  ;  Chief 
Abraham  HofF ;  Logan  of  the  Alonsees. 

Returned  from  the  village  by  a  diflferent  route  along  the 
Thames,  calling  on  the  wav  to  see  two  families.    The  head  of 
one  of  these,  in  the  course  of  conversation,  informed  me,  that  he 
should  like  lo  attend  sometimes  the  Delaware  Church,  but  his 
wife's  family,  who  are  like  himself,  all  Yankees,  would  not  suffer 
it.    This  family  attends  no  where,  like  too  many  of  the  same 
class,  and  their  children  were  never  baptized  ;  but  this  is  a  rite 
they  never  think  of  observing.      This    total    indifference    to 
religious  subjects  here,  as  well  as  ehetrhere,  seems  to  arise  from  a 
hostile  feeling  to  all  order  and  good  government.    For,  notwith- 
standing all  the  boasted  liberty  of  the  American,  at  least  in  this 
part  of  the  country,  I  can  only  see  it  exhibited  in  the  way  of 
ignorance,  presumption,  and  irreligion ,   in  fact,  their  idea  of 
liberty  means  licentioiisness.     But  then  it  is  admitted  on  all 
hands  that  the  Canadian  Yankees  are  the  worst  specimen  of  the 
State's  people.    They  certainly  constitute  the  lowest  grade  in 
intellectual  life  ;  and,  as  I  have  said,  their  ideas  of  liberty  are  so 
perverse,  that  religion  of  every  shade  is  sadly  discountenanced, 
and  republican  politics  seem  to  be  regarded  as  their  daily  bread. 
On  my  visit  to  the  other  family,  a  few  miles  further  on,  I  felt  even 
more  distressed  in  holdingconversewith  them  on  the  all-important 
subject,  "  the  one  thing  needful,"  as  they  are  natives  of  England, 
and  only  a  few  years  settled  here.    When  I  had  to  speak  to  the 
father  of  this  family  in  the  Avay  of  reproof  for  neglecting  the 
means  of  instruction  and  the  public  ministry  of  the  Church, 
which  is  only  a  few  miles  from  his  jjlace,  his  only  reply  was, 
that  he  considered  the  distance  too  far  to  go  to  Delaware  ;  and 
moreover,  he  said,  he  felt  so  tired  after  the  week's  work.    It  is 
melancholy  to  think  the  great  lack  of  religion,  alas  !  that  prevails 
among  this  description  of  English  who  have  settled  in  these 
parts  ;  they  are  wretchedly  ignorant  of  the  Scriptures,  with  the 
exception  only  of  a  few  families,  who  indeed  love  to  hear  of  the 
things  which  belong  to  their  present  and  everlasting  peace. 

June  11th. — It  was  matter  of  agreeable  surprise  to  me,  to 
set;  all  the  Indian  chiefs  come  to  my  residence  this  day,  for  the 
purpose,  as  they  said,  of  attending  at  the  Delaware  Church  on 
to-morrow ;  accommodated  them  for  that  night  as  well  as  I 
could — some  in  the  cottage  and  the  rest  in  the  out-offices.  Their 
interpreter  explained  all  that  I  said  at  evening  prayer. 

12th. — The  Church  at  Delaware  was  unusually  crowded  ; 
so  much  so  that  some  of  the  Inuians  had  to  sit  upon  the  Aoor.

temptation,  and  l^ul  tiu&gt;  firmness  not  to  violate  the  solemn  pro- 
mise Jio  made  at  his  own  church. 

August  IHth. — On  arrivinjf  early  this  TnorninL'  at  that  part 
of  the  Indian  villajfe  inhabited  by  tho  AIons(!es,  f  observed  an 
unusual  stir  amoni;-  them,  all  preparinpf  to  attend  (yiuirch.  Capt. 
Snake,  their  principal  and  most  inHuontial  cliief,  had  just  visited 
their  diflerent  wigwams  and  camps  to  give  them  notice.  This 
cliaracter,  whom  I  fretjuently  allude  to  in  my  jonrmil,  is  a  most 
interesting  being,  and  latterly  has  become  so  decidedly  changed 
that  his  entire  soul  ap])ear8  to  be  devoted  to  tiio  Lord  ;  he,  with 
others,  are  candidates  for  baptism.  Moreover,  he  is  quite  a  little 
gentlouan  in  his  maimers  ;  in  him  I  have  not  only  the  church- 
going  bell  to  (five  Iho  people  timely  notice,  but  an  able  assistant 
also  to  warn  them  to  iiee  from  the  wrath  to  come.  lie  addresses 
his  tril)e  not  only  as  an  interpreter  for  me,  at  the  time  of  service, 
but  at  all  ordinary  time  takes  every  opportunity  to  advise,  ad- 
monish, and  direct  them  to  divine  and  heavenly  things.  After 
he  gets  them  all  in  motion  towards  the  Church,  he  then  follows 
them  in  tho  rear  to  see  that  none  lags  behind.  In  his  younger 
days  he  distinguished  himself  as  a  celebrated  warrior,  fighting 
on  the  side  of  the  British  at  the  head  of  his  tribe,  during  tho 
revolutionary  war.  The  Bear  Crtjoks  happened  to  be  absent, 
some  in  visiting  their  friends  at  St.  Clair  Kiver,  others  in  hunt- 
ing expeditions,  with  the  exception  of  two  families,  who  at- 
tended with  their  children.  After  morning  service,  which  1  am 
obliged  to  shorten,  as  the  same  with  the  sermon  must  bo  re- 
peated by  different  interpreters,  I  preached  from  1  Peter  v.  8. 
lloff  interpreted  for  the  Bear  Crooks,  and  Croesbec  for  the  Chip- 
pewas.  After  concluding  with  tho  blessing.  Captain  Snake  stood 
up  and  addressed  them,  recapitulating  the  leading  topics  of  the 
sermon,  enforcing  most  touchingiy,  as  I  was  afterwards  informed 
by  Hoff,  the  necessity  of  sobriety  and  watchfulness,  as  the  enemy 
of  souls  attacks  but  too  successfully  such  among  them  as  are 
destitute  of  christian  graces.  As  tho  hour  was  too  far  advanced 
in  the  day  to  hold  the  Sunday-school,  besides  the  children  were 
hungry,  as  I  perceived  some  of  them  eating  squash  and  roasted 
Indian  corn,  after  Snake  closed  his  discourse,  I  gave  the  children 
notice  to  attend  next  day,  as  I  shall  remain  for  the  night,  and 
would  have  more  time  to  hoar  them  all  say  their  lessons.

soon  as  I  am  sutisfietl  that  they  &lt;'learly  understand  th(»  first  prin-

they  can  read  well,  and  no  doubt  can  iiiKlerHtnnd  it  iniicli  better 
than  the  ICn/iflish.     It  is  now   little  iikh-c  than  twelv(&gt;  months 
since  the  scliool  was  oitened  for  tlic^  admission  of  their  children, 
heMidcH  the  Indian  childn&gt;n  an*,  of  all  others,  the  most  irre^'ular  in 
attendance,  as  they  always  accompany  their  jtarents  in  their  ex- 
cursions ;  and  they  are  so  attached  to  their  children,  that  they 
will  not  sut.  T  them  out  of  their  sight  for  any  time.     J  dismissed 
the  school  about  three  o'clock,  p.m.,  having  given  them  first  a 
few  words  of  advi(;e  in  my  broken  Chippewa.     Aft»M*this,  visited 
A.   Ilolf's,  of  whom  I  have  good   lioi)es,  gave   him   and  family 
suitable  advice,  and  took  leave.    The  next  visit  was  to  Jlalf- 
inoon's,  a  truly  excelhmt  creature  ;  spoke  to  him  of  the  wonder- 
ful and  matchless  love  of  Jesus  Christ  the  Hon  of  (rod,  in  dying 
for  ns,  poor  foolish  wicked  sinners,  and  of  the  ])roniise  of  the 
Holy  Hpirit  to  his  believing  poop  e,  and  of  the  necessity  on  our 
part,  ot  resorting  fre&lt;ineiitly  to  prayer,  as  one  of  the  means  of 
acquiring  strength,  to  stand  against  the  wiles  of  the  wicked  one. 
lie  sensibly  felt  every  word  of  this,  for  the  tears  trickled  down 
his  sable  cheeks  while  we  were  on  this  subject  ;  and  in  jiarting, 
I  have  no  doubt  that  his  (way-we-ne)  thank  you,  come  from  a 
heart  overflowing  with  love  to  me,  for  the  truth's  sake.    Called 
then  at  Captain  Snake's  camp,  where  I  also  nn't  with  Westbrook, 
another  Monsee  chief,  who  attended  at  prayers  on  yesterday,  both 
were  glad  to  see  me.    I  sat  with  them,  and  conversed  on  the  all- 
important  subject — the  salvation  of  the  sonl ;  I  then  knelt  down 
and  prayed  with  them  ;  both  these  nnderstand  all  I  say,  though 
they  can  speak  but  very  indiflferently  in  English.    Left  '"onco 
about  half-past  four,  and  reached  my  residence  near  Delaware 
iibout  half-past  eight ;  a  shower  of  rain  made  the  Indian  jiath  by 
which  I  returned  very  tedious  and  unpleasant  ;  added  to  which, 
I  tolt  tired  and  hungry,  a.s  I  was  fasting  the  entire  day,  the  poor 
Indians  using  no  other  diet  than  roasted  corn  soup,  which  is  both 
unsavoury  and  unpalatable — their  cookery  is  certainly  of  the 
the  worst  kind. 

11th  Sept. — On  my  way  to  the  Indian  village,  called  at  a 
young  man's  house,  a  native  of  Scotland,  who  has  been  in  the 
habit  of  accompanying  me  to  the  Indian  church  for  some  Sab- 
baths during  the  past  as  well  as  the  present  year.    Our  conver- 
sation by  the  way  is  commonly  on  the  subject  of  true  and  un- 
defiled  religion.    I  fondly  hope  that  this  person  is  now  really 
awakened  to  a  sense  of  vital  godliness  and  true  Christianity.     I  &gt; 
have  known  him,  on  first  settling  here,  to  be  in  the  habit  of  drink-  - 
ing  too  freely,  and  therefore  neglecting  the  means  of  grace ;  it  is  ' 
delightful  to  witness  in  such  a  person,  so  remarkable  a  change  ; 
now,  the  Sabbath  and  the  privilege  it  brings,  are  subjects  of  joy, 
peace,  and  comfort.

On  roachinff  tho  village,  I  iininodiatcly  pcn^uvod  it  to  bn

my  idea  of  what  a  cbief  oujifbt  to  be — a  cbiof  or  buad-nuui  in 
every  f(oo«l  word  and  work — to  bo  a  cbiof  loader  amon^  yo&gt;ir 
pooplo  in  all  tiling  bolv,  juNt,  and  ^ood  :  to  bo  a  chief  under  tho 
^reat  Captain  of  our  Halvation,  tloNUH  CbriNt,  is  the  nioHt  honour- 
able oiKco  on  earth."  The  old  man  appeared  much  ideaNed  with 
my  remark,  and  said,  "  ho  it  oujjbt  to  be."  When  I  asked  him, 
was  his  Hquaw  gone  to  Church,  ho  answered,  "  no  go  to-datfy  she 
tick.' 

On  rcachin);  the  Church,  I  found  his  poonle  already  assem- 
bled in  their  places.  1  waited  a  while  for  the  Dear  Creeks  to 
arrive  before  commencinL^  service.  The  text  was  from  Horn, 
viii.  chap,  latter  part  of  9tli  verso  ;  whereupon  I  Cvjmmencod  by 
pointing  out  the  spirit  that  all  men  are  naturally  possessed  of  as 
tho  children  of  ^tiilty  Adam — its  awful  effects  is  too  frequently 
exhibited  to  us  in  the  world — instanced  the  melancholy  end  of 
George  Joiinson,  a  native  of  En^hmd,  at  the  village  of  Delaware, 
who  met  an  awful  death  in  tho  course  of  tho  past  week  by  falling 
from  a  loft  in  the  dead  hour  of  the  night  in  a  state  of  intoxica- 
tion— then  proceeded  to  show  them,  by  contrast,  who  the  Jioly 
Spirit  is,  especially  as  regards  his  fiiiits — the  8i)irit  tha*  wars 
continually  and  effectually  against  the  evil  one — thie  Spirit 
which  the  Most  High  has  promised  to  give  all  those  who  believe, 
love  and  obey  the  Lord  .Icsus  Christ  the  Saviour.  I  concluded 
by  telling  them  how  deepl)^  interested  all  true  Christians  are  for 
their  salvation — alluded  to  our  monthly  meetings  at  home,  on 
the  first  Monday  evening  of  every  month,  for  the  out  pouring  of 
that  blessed  Spirit,  and  spread  of  the  Gospel  among  them.  After 
the  interpreters  concluded  their  task,  then  Snake  arose,  and 
with  uplifted  eyes  to  heaven  commenced  to  touch  briefly  on  the 
leading  heads  of  my  discourse ;  from  thence  he  proceeded  to 
exhort  them  most  powerfully  and  feelingly,  as  appeared  from 
their  frequent  ejaculations,  urging  them  to  "  lock  up  all  these 
things,  which  are  the  best  riches,  in  the  store-houses  of  their 
hearts."  I  then  examined  the  children  of  my  class  in  reading  a 
little  in  the  New  Testament,  and  in  repeating  the  Catechism. 
I  have  promised  to  nuike  each  child  a  present  of  a  Prayer  and 
Hymn-book  who  commits  the  Church  Catechism  to  memory, 
and  repeats  it  to  me  without  missing  a  word.  With  the  antici- 
pation of  this  treasure  they  are  really  overjoyed.  To  have  a 
Prayer-book  and  another  of  Hymns  in  their  own  hands,  like  the 
few  white  persons  whom  they  see  at  their  Church  sometimes  ; 
the  idea  of  this  actually  transports  them  with  joy,  and  it  serves 
at  the  same  time  to  give  them  a  spur  to  redouble  their  industry, 
perseverance,  and  diligence,  in  learning  these  prized  tasks.

Fntm  /Art  7Ji»h&lt;w  of  (lur'^r.  to  the  lirltUh  I'uftlic,  in  hehnlf  dj  the  Church 
ofEnijhiiid  in  Cancultif  recdri'd  in  Julijy  UI34. 

Fellow  Ciiuhtiaks, — llio  peculiar  (rircun»Htanc(»s  of  tho 
Churcli  of  Enjj;bind  in  the  I)io(H»H(M)f  Qnolux!  at  this  juncture, 
from  the  Npiritual  deNtitiition  ofnmny])eople,  and  tlio  dinunishiMl 
Hiipport  afforded  to  tho  Cler^^y,  nuiUo  it  incumbent  u|)on  nm  to 
uHo  t5very  exertion  to  remedy  tho  evils,  and  to  supply  the  wantH 
which  press  upon  us  so  heavily.  A  brief,  plain,  an&lt;l  simple 
statement  of  these  (circumstances  will,  it  is  believed,  be  sutticient 
to  command  attentiDH,  and  to  procure  assistance  from  a  generous 
public,  whicdi  is  so  much  nondt^d. 

The  Protestant  population  of  tho  Canadas,  owing  partly  to 
the  Hcatt«M'ed  situation  of  the  peonl.Mn  this  oxtensivo  country, 
and  partly  to  the  ignorance  of  Christian  13enevolent  Hocieties 
as  to  their  real  comlition,  havt!  never,  at  any  time,  been  well 
Hiip|&gt;lied  with  the  services  of  the  ministt^rs  of  religion.  Ihit  of 
late  years  the  number  of  thoso  who  are  destitute  of  thoiaiblic 
nu'ans  of  grace  had  greatly  increased,  in  consequence  of  largo 
uiul  continued  (Mnigrations  from  the  nuither  country  ;  and 
numerous  bodies  of  emigrants  are  now  living  in  settlements 
near  to  each  other.  Their  great  need  of  tho  ministrations  of  tho 
Church,  and  tluur  iucrensed  facility,  fnmi  these  circumstances, 
to  make  improvement  of  them  if  within  their  reach,  aro  mani- 
fest ;  but  in  many  instances  these  eottlements  aro  (piito  remote 
from  tlm  residence  of  any  Clergyman.  We  have  long  felt  tho 
want  of  Clergy  in  these  provinces  ;  and  a  princijjal  causo  of  thin 
want  his  boon  a  &lt;leficlency  of  means  for  their  support.  Thosi* 
who  have  at  diftoretit  times  como  out  from  Englanu  or  Ireland, 
or  who  have  been  ordained  in  this  country,  havo  hitlicro  been 
maintained  partly  by  his  Majesty's  Government,  and  jiartly  by 
tho  Hociety  for  tho  rropagation  of  the  Gospel  in  i'\)rcign  Parts. 
But  at  the  very  period  when  the  services  of  tho  Church  aro 
more  than  ever  needed,  tho  usual  annual  f,'rant  to  that  Society 
from  the  Imperial  parliament  has  been  withdrawn,  in  conse!- 
(pionce  of  this  measure  they  have  been  obliged  to  reduce  tin? 
scale  of  their  allowances  one-half ;  and  their  Alissionaries  u])on 
the  most  favourable  footing  will  now  receive  only  £100  a-year  ; 
in  addition  to  which  evil,  severely  felt  by  many  deserving  men 
and  their  families,  the  Society  are  compelled  to  abstain  from 
tlie  establishmc'  t  of  any  now  missions.  It  is  obvious  that  these 
measures  throw  a  heavy  burden  n])on  tho  ministers  and  people 
in  thes&lt;i  colonies ;  a  weight  of  loss,  and  expenco,  and  distress, 
more  than  they  can  bear,  and  justify  them  in  calling  on  their 
frieiuls  and  neighbours  to  helj)  tliem, 

If  the  people  upon  the  spot  have  not  fully  done  their  part, 
thry  have  at  least  done  much,  and  are,  I  trust,  willing  to  do 
more.  They  have  generally  made  exertions  anil  sacrifices  for 
the  erection  of  Churches,  several  of  which  I  am  necessitated  to 
loavo  very  imperfectly  supidied,  and  a  few  altogether  unserved. 
In  some  instances  they  liave  built  parsonage  houses,  or  other- 
wise provided  a  residence  for  their  minister  ;  and  they  are  about 
lo  be  (called  upon,  according  to  tlieir  moanr*,  to  make  imiuedial",

and  «tatod  contributions  towards  the  nmintcuance  of  the  CUn-fry. 
IJut  *'  3ro  are  i'aw  places  in  which  thoy  can  do  more  than  a  very 
little  for  their  support,  especially  in  tlie  sottienjent.s  still  unpro- 
vided with  ministers.     Althoujfh  I  "-.inid  hojjc  that  the  ChM'gy 
of  my  Diocese  have  learnt  how  to  he  abated,  and  to  suffer  need 
for  Christ's  sakv^,  }et  surely  they  ')u;^]it  not  to  hv  M'l  to  strujrj^le 
with  absolute  jtoverty  ;  and  1  have  no  hesitation  in  sayin;^  that 
.1,  Clerii^yman  in  Canada  cainiot  maintain  himself  and  his  family 
with    aiitable  res])ectal)ility  upon  an  income  of  less  than  t'20!) 
a-year.      This  the  greater   part    of  the   Cler;^y   have    hitherto 
received,  and  uniformly  been  led  to  expectt  as  their  continued 
yearly  income;   and  there  will  be  many  cases  of  extreme  hard- 
ship if  the  salaries  of  tried  and  laborious  servants  are  to  be  thus 
reduced  in  their  declining  years.     Tl.erc  is,  I  fear,  little  j)ros- 
pect  that  the  resources  of  the  country,  that  is,  either  the  jiroceeds 
of  the  Clergy  reserved  hinds  or  the  contributions  of  the  ])eople, 
will,  for  a  considerable   time  to   come,  alford   them   sii^ii  an 
income  as  I  have  here  stated  to  be  necessary.     Notwithstanding 
the  generally  flourishing  state  of  the  country,  the  persons  arc» 
but  few  in  number  who  have  it  in   their  power  to  s\ibs(;ribe 
largely  for  this    object  ;    and    these    again    are    subjected   to 
constant  appeals  to  their  bounty  from  the  distressed  i)ortion  of 
the  emigrant  population.,  as  well  as  in  behalf  of  the  various 
public  institutions  and  improvements  now  carrying  on  in  this 
country. 

It  should  be  mentioned  also  that  the  increased  value  of 
articles  of  commerce  and  sigriculture,  in  consequence  of  the  great 
emigration,  vi  of  no  advantage  to  mere  annuitants,  and  that  the 
calls  of  the  emigrant  poor  are  i)eculiarly  pressing  ujjon  many  of 
the  Clergy. 

The  population  of  Upper  Canada  exceeds  300,000  souls,  and 
is  rapidly  increasing.  Of  51,000  emigrants,  who  ari'ived  from 
tha  British  Isles  ixi  1832,  :J0,000  settled  in  that  province.  The 
proportion  of  the  Church  of  England  to  other  denominations 
cannot  be  stated  with  precision  ;  it  is  ])erhaps  nearly  one-third 
of  the  whole  population.  In  Lower  Canada,  acconling  to  tlio 
ccnsxis  taken  in  UJ31,  the  total  number  of  souls  was  511,917, 
about  four-fifths  of  whom  were  lioman  Catholic.;,  (it  will  he 
remembered  that  this  v/as  originally  a  Fi-ench  Settlement,)  and 
of  the  remainder  nearly  one-half  were  of  the  Ohuix'h  of  England. 
In  the  Upper  Province  the  number  of  Clergy  is  iifty-six,  whi; 
wil!  soon,  with  a  very  few  exceptions,  be  entirely  chargeal)lo 
upon  the  means  Avhich  can  be  raised  ir.  the  province.  In  Lower 
Canada  there  are  tliirty-six  Clergymen,  of  whom  twenty-two  ai*o 
•  now  paid  Avholly,  and  six  in  part,  by  the  Society  for  T.  C  F.  V. 
The  population  of  the.se  provinces  is  scattered  over  so  large  a 
surface  of  country  (the  Diocese  of  Quebec  extending  1,1)00  miles 
in  length)  that  tlie  labours  of  the  Clergy,  and  the  want  of  more 
ministers  must  not  be  estimated  merely  from  the  numbers  of  tlio 
people.     Most  of  the  Clergy  serve  at  least  two  congregations. 

It  is  propesod  that  the  ecclesiastical  resources  of  the  pro- 
vinces, together  witSi  the  voluntary  contributions  of  the  people, 
should  be  applied  towards  the  support  ot  the  Clei-gy  now  resident 
in  the  Diocese  ;  but  it  has  been  here  shewn  that  these  are  not

sufficient   for  the   i&gt;urposc,  and   tiuit   the  want    of   additional 

Ministers  is  urgent  and  inert-asing. 

It  is  j)artieularly  ior  the  relief  of  the  numerous  emigrants 
from  the  Jhitish  Isles,  to  provide  them  with  the  gospel  means 
of  grace,  that  this  appeal  is  made  to  the  British  public.  It 
woidd  be  very  oasy  fur  a  more  abh^  hand  than  mine  to  draw  a 
nujving  j)ictur»!  of  their  wants,  their  claims,  and  their  distresses, 
and  to  enlist  all  your  good  feelings  in  their  cause  ;  but  1  shall 
be  satisfied  in  laying  before  you  a  brief  and  j&gt;lain  statement, 
confident  that  it  will  be  suflicient  to  induce  you  to  give  them 
your  ]»resent,  and,  as  1  hojte,  your  continued  assistance. 

Tlie  niajoi'ity  of  these  emigrants,  in  leaving  their  native 
country  and  their  Innnes,  made  great  sacrifices  and  exertions, 
and  separated  themselves  from  much  that  was  dear  to  them. 
Many  of  them  by  their  rennnal  have  lessened  the  burthens  of 
their  respective  jwtrishes,  and  thus  added  to  the  means  of  their 
friends  and  neigli'oours  whom  they  have  left.  It  is  in  order  also 
to  relieve  the  people  that  his  Maji'sty's  Clovernment,  in  reducing 
the  iiul)lic  taxes,  liave  discontinucnl  the  usual  annual  I'arliamen- 
tary  grant  to  tli'  [society  f\)r  I'.G.F.l*.,  one  of  the  piincii)al  means 
for  tiie  sujiport  of  the  Clergy  of  these  i)r()vinces.  1  shall  not 
(piestion  the  expediency  of  this  measxire,  but  1  will  take  the 
liberty  to  state  that  1  know  one  of  the  reasons  upon  which  it 
was  udo])ted  to  have  been  the  jjrojiriety  of  calling  upon  the 
peoj)le  for  vohiutarv  contributions  in  i)reference  to  pioviding  for 
the  support  of  thv,  Cliurch  in  Canada  by  legislative  ena(rtments, 
and  the  belief  (hat  tlie  sum  thus  raised,  in  a  manner  more 
hatisfact(n-y  to  all  the  j)i!,rhes  intei-L'sted,  would  be  larger  than 
the  annual  Parliamentary  grant.  It  is  fair  to  make  this  repre- 
sentittion  ;  and  although  the  exjiectation  it  holds  out  may  be 
disa])pointed,  tlie  appeals  to  ])ul)lic  charity  being  so  numerous, 
it  serves  to  str^'Ugtlien  our  case  ; — and  a  stronger  one  cannot 
well  be  brought  forward. 

The  emigrants,  of  whose  sacrifices  in  leaving  their  homes, 
their  friends  and  relations,  their  Church  and  their  pastors,  I  have 
already  spoken,  are  for  the  most  part  constrained  upon  their 
arrival  in  Canada  to  go  into  new  settlements,  or  rather  to 
connnence  nuiking  them,  at  a  distance,  for  some  time  at  least, 
from  the  comforts  and  even  m^cessaries  of  life,  and  almost 
without  the  means  of  communication  to  enable  them  to  procure 
assistance  from  those  who  are  in  nun-e  favourable  circumstances. 
In  addition  to  these  privations,  a  great  })roportion  of  them  are 
destitute  of  the  sei-vices  of  the  Church,  of  the  benefits  of  public 
worship,  of  the  olHces  and  consolations  of  the  Ministers  of  the 
Gospel.  It  is  this  want,  this  loss,  this  distress,  aggravated  to 
them  by  the  recollection  of  forujer  experience,  and  to  be  judged 
of  in  some  degree  by  you,  who  at  presen'  enjoy  these  blessings 
denied  to  them,  which  we  call  upon  you  to  relieve.  We  ask 
you  to  give  tiiem  means  to  sup]dy  themselves  with  the  ministra- 
tions of  the  Church,  or  to  })rovide  for  sending  them  j)astors  to 
dispense  them  ;  we  ask  you  to  contribute  not  only  by  present 
bounty  but  by  continued  yearly  subscriptions,  to  their  temporal 
and  spiritual  welfare  in  things  most  valuable,  things  heavenly 
and  eternal.      You  must   bo  sensible  that  no  people  have  a

In  Him  let  us  tnist.  He  gave  himself  for  us  ;  let  us  help  one

UPPER  CANADIAN  TRAVELLING  MISSION 

FUND. 

Sketch  of  the  Rm  and  Progress  of  the  Upper  Canadian  TrareUlng 
Missiun  Fund,  estaJjUshed  to  assist  tJte  Ilon&amp;urable  and  liight  Rer. 
Cluirles  James  Steiniii,  Bishop  of  Quebec,  in  aimcer  to  Ms  "  Apptcai 
to  the  British  Publlcy^  which  reached  this  Country  in  July,  1834. 

In  the  year  1U33,  the  letters  of  the  Bishop  of  Quebec,  to  me, 
mentioned  in  strong  and  pathetic  terms,  the  difficulties  and  dis- 
tresses of  his  i)eople,  (increased  by  the  two  previous  years'  emi- 
gration above  100,000  souls,)  and  his  extreme  anxiety  to  obtain 
the  means  of  aiding  a  plan  which  "  The  Society  for  the  Conver- 
sion of  the  Indians,  and  Propagating  the  Gospel  amongst  the 
destitute  Settlers,"  (founded  at  Toronto,  in  1830,)  had  tried, 
with  considerable  advantage,  in  the  Home  District,  viz.  employ- 
ing a  Missionary  to  travel  about  among  the  Settlers,  to  greet 
them  occasionally  in  the  Lord,  where  there  was  no  prospect  of 
obtaining  maintenance  for  a  settled  resident  Mission  ;  so  tliat 
at  least  a  spirit  of  Christianity  may  be  kept  up  among  them  till 
more  can  be  done.  The  same  letters  mentioned  his  intention  of 
calling  the  attention  of  the  mother  country  to  the  unhappy  state 
of  the  emigrants,  by  issuing  an  "  Apjjeal  to  the  Bi-itish  Public," 
and  urged  me  when  it  came,  to  give  him  all  the  support  in  my 
])ower.  Time  passed  on,  every  letter  expressing  more  and  more 
strongly  his  Lordship's  anxiety  upon  the  subject,  till  in  July, 

1834,  the  Kev. arrived,  bringing  with  him  the  promised 

Appeal.    It  had  been  arranged  by  the  Bishop,  in  expectation  of 

support  from  a  venerable  body  at  home,  that  the  Itov. , 

should  act  under  their  sanction  and  authority  ;  but,  for  wise 
reasons  no  doubt  on  their  i)art,  the  expected  support  was  re- 
fused, and  in  consequence  the  Rev.  Agent  (considering  the  at- 
tempt to  be  hopeless)  gave  up  the  cause  in  despair,  and  deter-

mined  to  do  nothlmj.  Circunistunee:'  had  carried  me  to  London  un- 
expectedly (the  tii-st  time  for  neven  years)  and  1  there  received 
the  coj)y  sent  mo  hy  the  Jiisliop — of  course  1  soon  loarnt  the 
state  oi' things,  and  that  thoi'c  was  no  jiror'at'ioii  for  rt'-jjnHthuj  and 
cUridatuK)  thi'  A/ijeol.  However  stringent  the  restrictions  with 
regard  to  expediency  might  1)0  as  respected  others,  or  the  ap- 
pointed Agent,  1  saw  no  oartlily  reason  why,  in  so  glaring  a  case 
of  spiritual  destitution  (of  which  1  was  cognizant,  hut  the  public 
were  not,)  those  bonds  siiouid  influence  me  ;  and  though,  of 
course,  the  aid  of  an  unknown  individual  nnist  needs  be  trifling, 
compared  trith  irhat  m'u/lit  liare  hecii,  hy  and  with  the  advice  of  a 
lamented  relative  of  the  Jli^lioj),  now  no  more,  (at  whose  house 
1  was  staying,  and  conse(|U('iUly  had  oi&gt;i)ortunity  thoroughly  tu 
discuss  tlie  matter,)  as  the  :igont  had  failed  in  a  second  powerful 
quarter  to  which  lie  applied,!  resolved  to  undertake  the  irrintinif 
and  clrcuhit'ion  of  the  u-lpjical  at  my  own  j'hk,  and  immediately  wrote 
to  the  Bishop,  from  iS'ortl)wick  'I'errace,  that  I  had  done  so. 

The  previous  arrangcnu'iits  nuide  by  his  Lordship,  in  expec- 
tation of  sanction  and  soi)port  from  the  deservedly  venerable 
body  referred  to,  had  provided  for  their  interference,  and  that 
of  other  official  parties,  with  regard  to  tlie  funds.  In  order,  there- 
fore, to  remedy  the  difliculties  this  might  occasion,  and  to  prevent 
the  misapplication  of  our  .subscriptions  to  the  subjects  treated 
of  in  the  early  paragra]&gt;h  of  "  The  Ap})eal,"  whicJ»  we  consi- 
dered the  GovernnuMit  ought  to  I'ociify,  jiud  were  therefore  re- 
solved on  no  pretence  to  interfere  w'th — and  that  we  might 
secure  to  onrselrcs  and  the  liisho))  of  Quebec,  the  sole  ap])lication 
of  them  to  tlie  ohjects  we  had  specially  in  view,  and  which 
formed  tlie  suhjeci;  of  the  two  list  jiaragraphs  of  the  Appeal, 
viz. :  "  The  icretchcd iicks  of  tlie  recent  Em'ujrants  nud  the  Tracdlimj 
Missions  nmoihj  them"  1  a])])ointed  my  own  bankers,  (Stone  and 
Co.  Lombard-street,)  as  our  London  receiving  house — and  such 
other  provincial  banks  and  l)ooksellers  as  offered  me  their  aid. 

On  the  1st  of  August,  Hio4,  I  received  my  first  subscription, 
and  on  tl:e  Ist  of  November,  after  collections  in  St.  Thomas' 
(Church,  Newcastle,  and  the  Parish  Cliurch  of  Gateshead,  upon 
the  princi])!e  of  j)roin])t  aid  wjiich  1  professed,  I  felt  justified  in 
writing  to  tiie  Lishop,  tiiat  he  might  diaw  on  me  for  ct'50,  and 
that  I  had  reason  to  hope,  in  tiiree  months  1  should  be  able  to 
meet  another  draft  to  the  same  amount.  He  received  my  letter 
in  the  end  of  December,  WAiA,  a  few  days  before  the  annual 
meeting  of  tJie  society  at  Toronto,  already  referred  to  ;  and  at  a 
time  when  they  whoi'e  urgently  jnessed  by  the  emigrants  of  the 
^lidland  District,  to  establish  a  Tj-avelling  Mission  there  ;  but 
the  sum  guarauteed  was  insufficient  for  the  maintenance  of  the 
liiissiou,  and  the  iiroject,  thougii  gieatly  needed,  must  have 
fallen  to  the  ground.  The  iinexj)ected  subsidy,  placed  tit  the 
liishoji's  disjiosal  by  me,  on  the  ))art  of  our  friends,  removed  the 
difficulty,  and  his  Lordship  immediately  promised  £25  towards 
the  appointment,  not  absolutely  ])ledgiug  us  to  continue  it  ;  but 
on  the  understanding  that  he  would  apprize  me  of  it,  and  had 
little  doubt  that  we  woxild  enable  hint  to  cont'ume  it  for  three  years  if 
we  cotdd.  In  January,  1835,  Mr.  Stewart  ilarpur  was  ordained 
to  the   niiisj^ion,  and  i&lt;eut  immediately  to  the  work.     The  inter-

estin;:^  journal  of  iiis  firt  year  is  ready  for  pubUeation,  if  I  could 
ensure  a  sale  to  cover  the  expencos,  so  as  not  to  injure  our  small 
fund.  The  other  half  of  the  auni  enabled  the  liishop  to  provide 
the  services  of  the  Uev.  J.  C  Usher,  in  the  townships  of  Glaii- 
ford,  Saltileet,  and  Uinbroke,  upon  the  tshores  of  Bridlington 
JJay,  for  the  year  11W5.  Meanwhile,  with  this  explanation,  I 
received  letters  from  his  Lordship,  uryinij  enciuiries  to  be  made 
re;^ardin^'  Mr.  Vachell,  who  had  been  stronijly  recommended  to 
him,  as  admirably  qualified  for  a  Travelling  Mission  ;  and 
desirin;*',  that  if  such  enquiries  proved  satisfactory,  and  mtam  for 
kit  Dhi'iiitencmce  conkl  he  procured,  wishing  him  to  be  sent  out  with- 
out delay,  to  undertake  tlie  Loudon  District.  The  enquiries 
were  eminently  satisfactory,  but  the  means  I  luul  not.  At  thiM 
juncture  tlie  Earl  of  Aberdeen,  then  Colonial  Secretary,  placed 
£100  at  my  disposal,  for  the  purpose  of  prompt  assistance  to  the 
Jiishoj)  ;  and  I  immediately  arranfi;ed  with  Mr.  V.  to  proceed  to 
Canada ;  «;uaranteeing  him  for  three  years  J'rom  his  eiitry  on  the 
Mission  in  Upper  Cawuki,  a  salary  of  £70  per  annum,  and  his 
reasonable  expencea  out,  subject  to  the  api)robation  of  the  Bishop 
of  Quebec.  On  the  29th  of  April  ho  sailed  from  Liverpool,  and 
after  a  very  (piickj)assaf];e  reached  Quebec,  a  few  days  before  tiie 
Bishop  arrived  from  Upper  Canada. 

The  emergencies  of  the  Church  induced  his  Lordship  to  de- 
tain him  in  tlie  Lower  Province,  mth  ichlch  onrfaiic/s  dcAgncdbjy  do 
not  interfere,  and  the  Bishop  arranged  that  his  agreement  Avith 
me  should  be  suspended  for  the  time,  and  take  effect  again  as  soon 
as  he  had  enttred  vpnn  the  Upper  (.'aiiadian  Mission.  Upon  adopting 
this  arrangement  the  Bishop  wrote  to  me  to  commence  fresh 
enquiries,  and  witli  as  little  delay  as  I  could  help,  to  send  him  a 
substitute  for  Mr.  Vachell,  in  the  London  District — a  dangerous 
step  for  me  in  the  then  state  of  our  fund,  but  which  I  did  not 
hesitate  to  incur.  I  was  again  successful  in  the  event ;  and  on 
the  19th  of  October,  IGlio,  Mr.  Thomas  Green,  B.  A.  of  Trinity 
College,  Dublin,  sailed  with  most  excellent  testimonials  from 
beneficed  Clergymen,  in  Ireland,  to  whom  he  was  well  known, 
and  reached  Quebec,  via  New  York,  in  the  end  of  December. 
On  the  18th  of  January,  1836,  he  was  ordained,  (having  been  the 
Bishop's  guest  in  the  meantime,)  and  went  immediately  forward 
to  the  London  District,  in  which  he  has  continued  to  labour,  with 
satisfaction  to  the  people,  and  to  the  scanty  supply  of  the  neigh- 
bouring Clergy  ever  since.  His  account  of  his  ^Lssion,  and  the 
testimonial  to  his  zeal  and  faithfulness  sent  to  the  Bishop,  by 
the  Rev.  Francis  Evans,  of  Woodhouse,  in  the  district,  have  been 
printed  and  circulated-  snid  have  also  appeared  in  the  Church  of 
England  Magazine,  the  Record,  and  sundry  Provincial  Papers. 

I  pledged  myself,  in  the  outset,  that  the  funds  entrusted  to 
nie  should  be  promptly  app.lied  at  the  discretion  of  the  BisJiop  of  Quebec, 
and  on  these  three  cases,  Mr.  Ilarpur,  Mr.  Vachell,  and  Mr. 
Green,  I  rest  my  justiification.  The  first  case  also  proves,  that  it 
is  not  withoiit  reason  I  claim  to  be  a  friend  and  fellow-labourer 
with  "  The  Society  at  Toronto,"  tliough  personally  unacquainted 
with  any  of  its  members,  except  its  president,  the  Bishop  of 
Quebec.  At  the  Bishop's  request  I  became  a  subscriber  to  it 
from  its  outset  in  IJJ.10,  and  have,  in  liian.^ging  the  fund  entrusted

to  me,  been  not  loss  an\iou;i  to  secure  the  tlin  e  years  ])rovibioii 
of  £"26  for  Mr.  Ilaipur's  Midland  JSlisjsion,  than  to  make  good  to 
Mr.  Va&lt;l\ell  and  Mr.  Green,  the  agreement  for  the  same  term. 

In  atlilition,  however,  to  the  above  benefits  to  the  destitute 
j&gt;oiiulation  of  Uitper  Canada,  without  claiming  any  merit  to  my- 
self, (though  if  1  would  1  co\ild  by  the  accounts  point  out  the 
justice  of  such  claims,)  I  have  to  congratulate  my  own  friends 
and  those  of  the  liishop,  that  hy  &gt;iuati»  of"  The  Upper  Caiuvdian 
Travelling  Mission  Fund,"  we  have  been  able  to  contribute  in 
other  ways,  many  beams  of  comfort  to  the  latter  and  declining 
3ears  of  a  most  Apostolic  Pielate.  One  great  distresa  by  which 
he  was  overwhehned,  and  wliich  met  him  daily,  was  th&gt;:  total  uant 
ofdin/jo^eablef/iiids  to  nit^et  the  e.\if,'euces  of  his  neglected  Cliurch, 
or  to  rowai(i  the  zeal  aud  diligence  of  his  C'lergy.  'Jrusting  to 
supi)ort,  and  aimed  with  the  confidence  of  those  friends  with 
whom  I  could  communicate  i!i)on  tliis  point  at  his  own  rc([uest, 
I  did  not  hesitate  to  assist  him  in  this  uilennna — and  they  may 
have  the  e-atit^faction  of  knowing — that  .small  as  our  means  have 
been,  we  did  not  fail  him— and  taking  Canada  as  it  is,iiU  an 
ample  remedy  far  this  er'd  is  provideti,  at  the  discretion  of  autiKjritien 
on  the  sj:ut,  alio  to  learn,  and  free  to  act,  far  less  good  will  l)e  dono 
by  Large  funds,  subject  to  ru'a  and  rcdrkt'wu  in  Eihjiand,  than  by 
smaller  means  subject  to  no  rcHrictiou,  edte^t  care  in  ilte  (iiqei!!;err, 
that  they  do  not  ruin  the  instruhient,  by  n-hufc  laioiir  *w;/t  suf'}.liei  are 
obtained  at  home;  or  yire  to  casualt'es  trhat  is  al-tiolutely  reijuired  to 
nmke  e/oodthe  ayreenieiiia  entered  into  before.

FIRST  LETTER. 

Toronto,  [Tj&gt;j&gt;er  Canada,  ITth  Nov.  1834. 

*  *  *  *  I  am  much  oblij^'od  to  you  for  your  letter  from 
Noi  tliwick  Terrace.  On  the  lltli  instant,  1  wrote  to  Lord  Gal- 
loway, and  havin&lt;^  a  copy  of  pait  of  my  letter,  I  now  send  you  a 
transcript. 

EXTRACT    FROM    TRANSCRIPT. 

"  The  want  of  any  funds  at  my  command  is  a  ^reat  incon- 
"  venienec  to  me,  as  the  late  rcductioii  falls  particularly  heavy 
"  on  the  Missionaries  ajjpointed  since  July,  ]U:i'.\  ;  and  some  of 
"  them  are  most  deservin&lt;4-  Missionaries.  The  usefulness  of  the 
"  Travelling?  Missionary  in  this  Home  District,  Rev.  A.  Elliot, 
"  makes  the  ])rofital)leness  of  the  ollice  to  the  Church  very 
"  apparent.  'I'he  number  and  increase  of  Episcoi)aliaiis  in  this 
"  province  proves  to  he  greater  tlian  was  generally  supposed. 

"  A  ISlr,  Cusach,  of  St.  John's,  (Catharine  ilall,  En.)  has 
"  l)een  highly  recommended  to  me — and  a  Mr.  Vachell,  hrotlier- 
"  in-law  to  the  Archdeacon  of  the  Isle  of  Man,  is  also  highly 
"  spoken  of  as  a  candidate  for  such  a  Mission.  I'hey  are  not  in 
"  holy  orders  ;  but  I  beg  to  commend  them  to  the  enquiries  of 
"  your  Society— (The  Society  alluded  to  by  the  Bishop  was  not 
"  framed,  and  tlie  Editor  having  made  due  enquiries,  and  for- 
"  warded  satisfactory  testimonials  to  the  liisliop,  sent  Mr. 
"  Vachell  out  at  the  cost  of  the  U.C.T.M.F.  in  April,  iJ^S.)  I 
"  shall  add,  that  there  is  not  any  provision  for  any  new  Mission- 
"  aries  either  in  Upjier  or  Lower  Canada,  and  that  they  ai-e 
"  greatly  needed  by  large  congregations.  I  shall  also  observe, 
"  that  the  largest  new  and  destitute  congregations  are  for  the 
"  most  ])art  p^migrants  from  Great  Britain  and  Ireland,  not  long 
"  settled,  and  unable  to  do  little  or  nothing  towards  the  mainten- 
"  ance  of  a  Ministry." 

LETTER   COXTINUED. 

Accept  my  thanks  for  the  continued  interest  you  take  in 
the  Church  in  Canada,  and  for  the  assistance  you  attbrd  us  ;  I 
shall  of  course  be  happy  to  co-oi)erate  with  you  and  other  friends 
to  the  best  of  my  i&gt;ower.  I  shall  send  this  open  to  my  brother 
James  to  read,  and  then  forward  to  you. 

Ever  your's  affectionately,

THIRD  LETTER. 

Toronto,  10 th  Jin.,  18.^5. 

**•**!  am  so  much  obliLfed  U)  you  for  your  zeal 
and  e?iertion  in  the  cause  of  the  Canadian  Church.,  that  I  bhall 
not  delay  writing  a  few  lines. 

On  Sunday  last,  I  ordained  Mr.  F.  S.  Ilarpur,  Deacon,  to  be 
Travelling  Missionary  of  the  Midland  District,  Upper  Canada. 
Our  Society  hero  for  the  Lidians  and  the  destitute  Settlers,  have 
promised  him  £75  P&lt;-T  annum,  and  I  have  promised  him  out  of 
your  funds,  £25  per  annum.  *  *  *  «  Again  let  mo  beg  of 
you  not  to  charge  yourself  unnecessarily  witb  any  expence.  It 
would  not  be  right — your  sacrifices  and  exertions  are  great 
and  ample. 

In  general,  £100  per  annum  is  about  sufficient  for  any 
Missionary  who  is  a  single  man,  and  you  will  remember  my 
former  charge — we  do  not  want  married  ones— when  we  parted 
at  Thorp,  some  years  ago. 

I  will  supply  you  M-itli  information  for  your  purposes,  as 
time,  o])portunity,  and  circumstances  may  enable  me.  Your 
letter  of  October  21st,  received  two  days  ago,  is  very  acceptable 
and  satisfactory,  and  I  have  endeavoured  in  this  one  to  notice 
the  chief  points  of  it.  I  cannot  well  at  present  say  "  how  few 
Missionaries"  we  could  do  with,  I  would  rather  say  the  more  we 
can  get  the  better. 

There  are  twdre  districts  in  Upper  Canada,  and  there  is  a 
Travelling  Missionary  only  in  tico  of  them.     *****

SIXTH  LETTKtt  FllO.M  THE  BISHOP. 

qucht'c,U)tiiJuiif,uvA:K 

My  time  has  of  Lite  heen  excessively  occupied,  especially  m 
my  liealth  ami  streufjfth  are  very  uncertain.  I  have  heen  anxious 
what  to  do  resi^ardinjif  Mr.  V.    The  Archdeacon  and  Hector  of 
Quehec  isahout  to  ji^o  to  England,  at  my  re(|uest,  and  he  has  heeii 
ohli^^ed  very  reluctantly  to  ]»art  witli  his  Curate  (Uev.  IJ.  (irasett) 
who  is  jjone  to  'I'oi'onto,  Upjjor  (^anada.     We  have  rei[uest&lt;Hl  and 
persuaded  Mr.  Vacdudl  to  take  his  jdace  here,  a  very  important 
one.    There  seems  to  he  a  sij^iuil  Providence  in  this  allotment, 
hut  you  must  excuse  my  enterinji^  into  the  particulars,  the  Arch- 
deacon will  liowever  j)rohahly  see  you    The  Archdeacon's  eu- 
paijement  with  Mr.  V.  will  last  till  his  return  hither  next  summer 
D.V.     TluM-e  will  he  sufficient  oi)enin;jfs  for  his  employment  next 
year,  and  you  may  in  the  meantime  send  out  in  his  place  another 
Travellinfi;  Missionary,  if  you  succeed  in  finding  a  satisfactory 
candidate — you  must  excuse  the  deficiency  of  my  correspondence 
at  present,  for  I  am  not    equal  to  it,  I  have  written  to  day  to 
Messrs.  Drummond's  to  ]jay  all  monies  they  have  received  on  my 
special  account  to  your  hankers,  Stone  and  C^o.     I  hold   myself 
hound,  and  see  no  difficulty  with  regard  to  providing  Mr.  Vachell's 
salai-y  to  the  end  of  the  three  years  guranteed  hy  yon,  and  to  he 
continued,  I   trust,  much  longer — if,  however,  I  die  soon — my 
reliance  must  he  iijioii  i/on  u.id  the  Arclidi'acoii,  and  ahove  all  upon 
(rod's  over-ruling  Providence.     ^lay  (iod  hless  you  and  me  and 
all  your's,  and   helieve   me  ever,   gratefully,    faithfully,    and 
affectionately,  &amp;c.  C.  J.  Q. 

The  reply  to  this. letter  was  couched  in  such  terms  as  the 
passage  scored  under — and  the  evident  feelings  of  the  liishop's 
mind  in  concluding  the  letter,  required— that  he  was  to  give 
himself  no  uneasiness  ahout  Mr.  V.,tluit  the  present  ai)pointment 
might  he  considered  only  suspensive,  and  when  concluded,  Mr. 
V.  might  fall  hack  upon  me,  for  that  hy  the  grace  of  (Jod,  witii 
the  Archdeacon's  assistance,  I  would  provide  for,  and  see  to  the 
fulfihuent  of  every  pledge,  and  that  I  would  seek  for  and  send 
out  a  fit  siihstitute  without  delav.

in  the  propriety  of  your  consideration  for  him,  in  sayinc^  that

qiirhcc.  Jan.  2r&gt;th,  UVMl 

The  [Mshop  received  your  letter  ot  Nov.  14th  on  Saturday 
last  (2.'id).  It  fifavo  him  very  ^roat  satisfaction  ;  indeed,  1  am 
sure  that  your  siicccssfnl  exertions  to  provide  him  with  men  and 
njoans  havo  been  amonpst  his  chief  comfortH,  so  far  as  re;j[ard»&lt; 
his  I)io(M»so,  for  some  time  past,  imdor  tho  Divine  blessin";. 
Yon  havo  indeed,  permit  mo  to  say  it  for  tho  encoura^'oment  of 
yourself  and  friends,  been  an  instrument  of  very  ^'reat  spiritual 
/rood  to  the  Diocese.  First  of  all  in  *  *  *  *  well  leanud, 
honest,  and  sinf];lo  eyed,  and  the  Lord  has  blessed  him  /:,'reatly, 
and  made  him  a  blessing—bo  is  now  tho  fearless  pronnilgator  of 
divine  truth  to  a  not  very  patient  people.  Then  Mr.  Vaehell,  1 
now  know  him  ;  and  certainly  ho  is  a  man  of  fiod.  His  sermon 
in  the  Cathedral  yesterday  morninpf  on  Isai.  Iv.  (&gt; — 7&gt;  "as 
faithful,  methodical,  and  simple — well  written  and  well  delivered. 
The  Dishop  pronounced  it,  with  an  emphasis,  an  exceedingly 
p;ood  sermon — and  his  discharpfo  of  his  pastoral  work  is  in 
keepinu;  with  his  preaching.  liastly,  as  yet,  Mr.  Green  arrived 
iiero  about  n  fortnight  since,  and  has  been  the  Bishop's  guest 
since  his  arrival.  His  examination  for  Orders  has  quite  satis- 
fied me  of  his  abilities  and  spirituality  ;  and  I  look  for  a  larti:  • 
measure  of  tho  Divino  blessing  on  his  labo\;rs.  He  was  or- 
&lt;lainod  this  morning  ;  and  in  a  few  days  ho  will  proceed  U&gt; 
his  Mission.  These,  of  the  Lord's  mercy,  are  "Workmen  that 
need  not  bo  ashamed,"  and  of  whom  their  employers,  I  am  per- 
suaded, also  through  his  mercy,  will  not  need  to  bo  ashamed.

TENTH  AND  LAST  LETTER  FROM  THE  niSIlOl'. 

Jiinnini/humj  Aur.  10///,  lli'Mi. 

Through  the  merciful  providence  of  (iod,  1  arrived  at  Liver- 
pool on  Saturday  night  last,  having  sailed  from  New  Y'ork  on 
the  17th  of  October.  I  have  been  very  deficient  in  writing  to 
you,  but  it  is  my  intention  to  come  soon  and  see  you  and  yours, 
L).V.    I  am  on  my  way  to  London,  via  Oxfoid. 

God  bless  you  and  yours,  and  believe  me  ever  faithfully  and 
affectionately,  yours,  C.  J.  Q. 

My  health  has  amended. 

But,  alas  1  at  Oxford  (the  excitement  of  his  return  being  too 
much  for  him),  commenced  that  series  of  attacks  which  ternu- 
nated  in  a  long  incapacity  for  any  business,  and  finally,  July 
lath,  1037,  in  his  death. 

TESTIMONY  TO  THE  ZEAL  AND  FIDELITY  OF 

MR.  GREEN, 

Athiresscd  to  the  (latej  Bishop  0/  Quebec,  (and  travsinitted  by  him  to 
ir.  J.  D.  W.J  from  the  liev.  Francis  J&lt;!vans,  Rector  of  Woodhouac. 

Rectoryy  Woodhume,  July  Gth,  1 83ti. 
My  Dear  Lord, — It  is  now  sometime  since  I  transmitted  to 
your  Lordship  any  intelligence  from  this  part  of  your  Diocese, 
and  I  feel  it  incumbent  on  me  now  to  address  you,  especially 
with  regard  to  Mr.  Green  and  his  labours. 

I  am  very  glad  to  be  able  to  bear  am])le  testimony  to  his 
zeal  and  faithfulness,  as  well  as  to  his  very  great  success  in  re- 
commending himself,  by  his  amiable  deportment,  to  "  all  sorts 
and  conditions"  within  the  range  of  his  labours.    He  has  now

established  a  regular  circuit,  extending  from  IJayham  (i.  e.  Port 
Jiurwoll  and  Vienna)  on  the  went,  nearly  to  the  mouth  of  the 
Grande  river,  upon  the  east  ;  and  extending  as  far  as  Burford 
upon  the  i  orth.  The  places  where  he  first  l)e&lt;&gt;;au  were  in  those 
congregations  which  1  had  collected,  and  wliere  I  ministered 
occasionally,  but  he  has  now  added  many  to  the  number  ;  and 
alm(&lt;st  ev^'ry  time  lie  returns  liere,  it  is  witli  tlie  tidings  of  fresli 
discoveries  of  scattered  Ciiurch  families,  sufficient  to  constitute 
congregations  of  from  twenty-live  to  forty  souls  in  a  place.  I 
presume  that  Mr.  Green's  congregations  are  small  compared  with 
those  obtained  in  otlu^r  districts  ;  but  they  are  all  lilcely  to  in- 
crease, both  fi'om  the  inttux  of  Settlers,  and  from  the  increasing 
disposition  of  dissenters  to  attend  his  ministry  ;  with  the  latter 
Mr.  G.  is  a  great  favourite,  as  indeed  those  Clergymen  ai-e  very 
apt  to  be,  who  preach  confornuibly  to  the  liturgy,  articles,  and 
homilies. 

Mr.  G.  is  looking  forward  anxiously  to  the  period  of  his  ad- 
mission to  full  oi'ders,  as  it  will  render  him  more  efficient,  lie 
has  been  obliged  to  call  upon  me  in  two  instances  to  go,  at  very 
short  notice,  many  miles,  to  administer  the  Lord's  Bujjper,  to 
atHictod  members  of  the  Church. 

With  respect  to  his  salary,  I  regret  to  sa}-^  that  my  oxj)ecta- 
tions,  on  that  liead,  are,  as  yet,  far  from  being  realized.  Tlif 
whole  country  is  in  a  state  of  b(tnkritj&gt;tci/,  and  there  are  many  re- 
spectable people  who  are  unable  to  meet  the  smallest  pecuniary 
demand.  I  luive  not  bt^en  able  to  collect  here  and  at  Ihirford, 
nmre  than  £12.  10s.,  and  there  are  a  few  pounds  more  which  I 
iiope  will  shortly  be  handed  to  me.  I  directed  the  ])eople  at 
Vienna  to  establish  a  branch  there,  and  to  remit  the  money  to 
Toronto  :  but  Mr.  G.  is  of  opinion  that  the  gcMieral  destitution  is 
more  felt  there  tluiu  any  where  ebe.  I  trust  times  will  shortly 
change  for  the  bc'tter,  and  in  the  meantime  express  a  hoi&gt;e  tliat 
this  part  of  the  country  may  not  be  dcprivetl  of  Mr.  Green's 
taluaUe,  and  unlrcrsaUij  valued  services. 

I  have  the  honour  to  remain,  my  Lord, 

Your  faithful  and  obedient  Servant, 

FRANCIS  EVANS. 

In  compliance  witli  an  intimation  received  from  the  lato 
Bishop,  a  short  time  before  his  last  attack,  the  Society  at  Toronto 
have  been  requested  to])ay  to  jNIr.  Green  the  whole  of  his  salary, 
£100  sterling  per  annum,  and  to  charge  it  to  the  fund  account.

that  period.  The  number  of  stations  are  nearly  sixteen,  and  it 
is  to  be  lioped,  before  many  weeks  elapse,  the  nnniber  will  be 
considerably  increased.  My  congrejjations  vary  from  twenty  to 
sixty  or  eifnity  :  many  of  whom  setnn  desirous  of  beinji^  enabled, 
by  the  Divine  aid,  to  live  in  a  manner  becoming  the  gosi)el.  1 
liave  reasonable  hopes  the  congre/^ations  will  increase,  and  all 
the  school-houses  be  filled  with  those  firmly  attached,  and  warmly 
devoted,  to  our  admirable  and  incomparable  liturgy,  particularly 
JUS  nmny  of  those  who  connected  themselves  with  dissenting 
bodies,  can  now  calculate  upon  the  regular  ministrations  of  a 
Clergyman.  In  some  of  the  congregations  the  responses  are 
audible,  and  uttered  with  a  degree  of  feeling  and  solemnity, 
cheering  and  comforting  to  the  mind  :  1  hope  ere  long  the  same 
l\jeling  and  fervour  of  devotion  will  animate  all  my  hearers.  Tlie 
Methodists  and  other  dissenters  come  to  hear  in  great  numljers, 
and  perhaps  we  may  not  be  expecting  too  much,  by  cherishing 
the  hope,  of  seeing  their  prejudices  towards  the  J^stablishment 
pass  away,  as  they  experience  and  witness  the  zeal  and  faithful- 
ness of  tliose  standard  bearers  of  the  Cross,  over  wJiom  the  Lord 
has  set  you  to  watch.  As  yet,  I  con^'n-;  my  wanderings  and 
labours  to  those  townships  and  settlements  in  which,  I  tiiiuk,  i 
may  be  most  usefully  employed.  I  have  preached,  on  an  average, 
neai'ly  one  sermon  on  each  day,  perfoi-ming  frequently  three 
services  on  Sunday.  The  baptisms  are  for  the  most  ])art  in  the 
school-houses  ;  aud  it  is  uniformly  my  custom  to  explain  the 
nature  of  that  Sacrament,  and  answer  the  various  objections 
made  to  infant  baptism.  I  hope,  ere  long,  to  submit  to  your 
Lordship  a  full  report  of  my  proceedings  ;  and  am  humbly  led  t&lt;( 
trust  that  my  preaching  and  advice  have  been  blessed  to  the 
comfort,  at  least,  of  one  individual.  May  the  Lord,  in  his  inhnite 
mercy  and  goodness,  add  to  the  number  daily. 

My  exiiortations  seem  to  be  prohtable  to  many  of  those  by 
whom  1  have  been  invited  to  spend  the  day  during  my  visits.  My 
privations  are  frequently  very  great — my  dangers  threatening- 
lay  labours  often  accompanied  with  exti'eme  fatigue ;  but  1  i)ray 
I  may  be  found  a  zealous  soldier  of  the  cross  ;  and  am  resolved, 
ill  the  strength  of  the  Lord  of  Hosts,  to  know  nothing  but  "  Jesu^ 
and  IJlmcraclJrcd." 

Mr.  Evans  has  been,  in  many  respects,  very  useful ;  but  he 
desires  me  to  say  that  he  has  not  been  able  to  collect  more  than 
forty  dollars,  he  hopes  however  to  add  to  them  shortly — but  as 
the  people  are  extremely  poor  it  will  be  hopeless,  for  the  present, 
to  expect  that  they  will  be  able  to  subscribe  sufficient  for  my 
.salary.  In  the  meantime,  if  your  Lordship  will  have  the  gooti- 
ness  to  send  me  some  money,  which  1  tiud  very  much  needed  in 
my  perambulations,  you  will  add  anotiier  favour  to  the  many 
already  conferred  upon  your  Lordship's 

Most  humble  and  sincerely  devoted  servant, 

THOMAS  GRKEx\.

Copy  of  a  Letter  from  the  7lcv.  Thomas  Careen,  Trarellhig  Missionary  in 

the  Loriduii  Didrict,   Upper  Curutda,  to  W.  J.  I).  W.,  dated  from 

Wovdhoiti^c,  October  2l«f,  Iti'Mj. — (Jlr.  G.  teas  sent  out  by  the  Fund, 

A'Uijiist,  115:^5.^ 

My  dear  Sir, — I  avail  niysolfof  a  few  days'  rest  from  my 

labours  to  give  you  souk;  acfouiit  of  m3'  employmont  since  I 

ontoroil  upon   tlio  sccuo  of  my  ministrations,  and  tlio\iffh  very 

desirous  pf  transmitting  some  details  of  my  mission  to  you  and 

your  friends,  favourable  to  tbo  missionary  cause  in  tliis  country, 

1  can  assure  you  I  liavo  bitlierto  been  prevented  entirely  by 

want  of  time,  l)eing  almost  Avithout  cessation  employed  in  thu 

duties  of  the  mission. 

iSince  my  arrival  in  the  Londun  District,  1  have  preached  on 
an  average  nearly  one  sennon,  and  ridden  tifteim  miles  every 
day,  expose&lt;l  to  every  variety  of  temperature,  uiulergoing  priva- 
tions— at  night,  resting  in  log  houses,  adnritting  through  their 
various  unstopped  chinks  the  cold  midnight  air  ;  suifering  from 
change  fi'om  lu)use  to  house,  what  1  had  not  most  remotely  anti- 
cipated piior  to  my  appointment  as  missionary;  but,  Sir,  1  do 
Jiot  for  one  nH)ment  regret  my  aecoptance  of  ilie  mission,  and 
rejoice  to  have  been  accounted  wortliy  by  my  heavenly  nuister, 
of  being  admitted  into  his  vineyard  as  a  standard  bearer  of  his' 
most  glorious  and  blessed  gospel. 

If  it  were  possible  for  the  true  Israelites,  who  in  your  highly 
favoured  land  abound  in  the  outward  means  of  grace,  and  sit 
under  a  fixed  ministration,  to  exchange  situations  for  a  short 
period  with  those  who  have  been  compelled  by  circumstances  to 
seek  a  home  in  the  dense  forests  of  America,  tlicy  would  gladly 
hail  and  fully  ackuowledgo  "  the  feet  of  tlu)s(&gt;  to  Ito  indeed 
beautiful,"  who  visit  from  time  to  time  their  secluded  dwellinj^s 
with  "the  glad  tidings  of  great  joy."  Could  they  fully  realize 
the  deplorable  extent  of  the  spiritual  destitution  of  veiy,  very 
many  who,  like  themselves,  once  enjoyed  the  happy  privileges 
of  Sabbath  services  and  Sabbath  schools  for  themselves  and  their 
childr;m  ;  could  they  roiilize  this  in  theic  imagination,  J  am  led 
to  hope  such  would  be  the  impression,  and  such  the  efforts  made 
to  promote  the  truth  as  it  is  in  Jesus,  that  great  would  be  the 
company  of  those  speeding  on  the  wings  of  love,  bearing  the 
message  of  iuercy — entering  at  every  door,  and  deeming  silence 
shame. 

I  am  very  conscious  that  your's  is  an  irksome  task,  to  bo 
obliged,  day  after  day,  continually  to  make  your  appeal  lo  the 
benevolence  of  your  friends  who  cannot  witness,  and  would 
hardly  b^'lieve  the  wants  of  the  r(^mote  settlers  in  the  woods, 
nor  the  Joy  occasioned  by  your  labour  of  love ;  but  I  trust  the 
time  is  liot  far  oft"  wJien  many  wlio  are  anxioiip  for  the  prosjte- 
rity  of  the  Church  of  Christ,  will  be  awakened  to  the  state  of  tliis 
country,  and  will,  with  untiring  zeal,  help  you  in  your  glorious 
work.  If  ever  there  was  need  of  exertion,  it  is  at  the  present 
time,  so  great  has  been  the  increase  of  emigration*  for  tlie  past 
season,  as  well  from  England  as  from  Ii-eland,  Scotland,  ami 
Wales,  and  these  for  the  most  part  of  the  labouiing  (.'lasses  only, 
wlio  cannot  be  expected  at  present,  however  willing,  to  contri- 
♦  20,000  souls  between  the  Ist  of  April  and  i-t  of  August,  18.%'.

Tliat  «uch  a  desire  exists  exteuiively,  1  have  wittiesi&amp;ed  on  n&gt;any 
occasions  ;  liavinL(  had  made  to  vne  iVequently  otfer;s  of  laud  and 
lumber  for  the  erection  of  (Jhurches,  iiud  t!iib!;frij'tivn.f  of  work  to  a 
very  lar^e  amount.  "  (iohl  and  silver  have  wi'  none  ;  but  bucli 
as  we  have  we  freely  give  unto  you."  A  farmer  in  the  tovvniiiiip 
of  Norwich  told  me  very  lately,  that  he  vvu.s  wilUu&lt;&gt;-  to  give  me 
as  unich  lumber  as  would  i)uild  a  Church,  and  repeatedly  ex- 
prewised  the  satisfaction  he  felt  at  having  been  sjuired  to  bee  once 
more  a  clergyman  of  that  Churcii  to  wliich  he  was  so  warmly 
attachiHl  beneath  his  roof.  On  another  oetasion,  on  my  way  to 
Port  IJurwi'li  (on  Lake  Erie),  in  tlie  township  of  Jiayham,  1  was 
accosted  by  a  jierson  whom  I  had  not  before  seen,  but  who  had 
heard  of  my  arrival  in  the  Ijoudon  District,  lie  asked  me  many 
questions  to  ascertain  whetlier  J  was  the  'rravelliiig  Missionary, 
and  after  a  long  and  interesting  conversalien,,Jie  handed  me  a 
dollar  as  his  annual  subsci'iptiun,  at  the  same  tium  requesting 
me  to  j)ut  down  on  the  subscription  list  the  name  of  his  Lrotiier- 
in-law  for  the  same  amount ;  and  he  remarked  that  if  at  any 
time  a  ChurcJi  could  be  erected  in  the  neighl)ourhood  of  h's 
ilvvuUing,  he  would  very  gladly  subscribe  26  dollars  in  cash. 

1  heiii-d  another  person  declare  he  w  ould  with  [deasure  sub- 
scribe to  the  amoimt  of  one  of  Jiis  btist  horses  for  the  same 
object.  h\  therefore,  Dear  !Sir,  such  zeal  and  such  love  be  pro- 
moted ami  clu.'rished,  as  it  ought  to  be,  what  c|uestion  can  tliere 
be  that  as  soon  as  the  emigrants  are  settled,  and  can  eomnumd 
the  means,  the  friends  of  the  gospel  on  the  otlier  side  the 
Atlantic  will  be  disburtliened,  and  the  Church  uf  our  fathers  es- 
tablished on  its  firmest  basis. 

it  is,  however,  deeply  to  be  regretted,  that  in  many  places 
there  is  a  total  disregard  of  the  Sabbath,  but  this  may  be  traced 
entirely  to  the  total  want  of  stated  services  and  Sunday  sciioois, 
and  I  thiuk,  eve  long,  it  will  be  otherwise.  Having  oiu-  day 
visitei*.  a  faiuly  from  Cumberland,  the  mother  remarked  to  me 
"  Oil  !  Sir,  we  are  now  differently  situated  from  what  we  were 
accustomed  to  be  in  England—  the  children  did  not  then  ask, 
'  Mother,  will  to-morrow  be  Sunday  T  which  tlujy  now  only  knoAv 
when  1  wash  them  on  Satniday  liight."  In  another  case,  the 
motliier  of  a  family  from  a  ])la(;e  near  iiristol,  said  to  me — "  Sir, 
this  p'iaee  is  not  like  the  old  country  ;  there  w&lt;'  had  a  Church, 
iirA  nice  Sunday  schools  for  tlie  children  ;" — and  in  many  places 
it  n*  olw^ervahle  that,  from  tiie  total  want  of  sound  and  evange- 
lical 1i'»«*'liing,  the  most  fanciful  and  extravagant  theories  in 
reli{4i&lt;*Pi  readily  find  disciples,  and  thus  the  seeds  of  Socinianism 
and  Ciiiver.salism  are  disseminated  and  cherished. 

At  present  1  have  nearly  fourteen  stations  in  the  townships 
of  Bradford,  Windham,  Middleion,  IJayluun,  and  W'aljmle,  in  all 
which,  with  little  exception,  there  are  regular  services  every 
tliird  week.  1.  have  endeavoured  to  establish  Sunday  schools, 
and  hope  ultimately  to  succeed  (Cod  willing).  I  have  distri- 
luited  from  2600  to  3000  pages  of  well-wi-itten  and  a]ipropriate 
tracts,  whicli  arc  most  eagerly  sought  after  by  all  classes  and 
denominations.  On  Sunday-  the  l(&gt;th,  I  distributed  a  few  after 
evening  service,  and  after  family  })rayor :  having  retired  to  rest,

I  was  very  much  pleased  to  hear  the  father  of  the  family  read 
aloud  the  tracts  which  I  had  giveu  to  iiim,  and  uiake  a  few  suit- 
able comments,  as  any  passage  or  circumstance  i)resonted  itself 
in  the  course  of  readiu*^  them  througii. 

If  I  could  by  any  means  procure  a  small  sujjply  of  Prayer 
liooks  and  Testaments,  they  would  be  very  acceptable.*  1  have 
written  to  a  few  friends  on  the  subject,  and  daily  hope  to  hear 
from  some  of  them  of  some  i)lan  to  secure  me  occasionally  a  few, 
accompanied  Avith  tracts.  But  let  me  mention  to  you  another 
incident  wliich  occurred.  llavin&lt;)f  visited  a  family  in  which 
all  the  children  (six  in  number)  were  unl)aptised,  1  left  a 
tract  culled  "  A  Visit  to  the  Pastor's  Stxuly,"  iind  from  time  to 
time,  as  I  passed  in  my  rounds,  answered  the  objections  made 
by  tlie  parents  to  infant  baptism.  I  then  allowed  some  time,  to 
elapse,  when  again,  in  my  way  to  my  appointments  to  places 
adjacent,  I  called  to  see  them,  and  was  much  gratified  to  hear 
the  father  express  an  earnest  desire  that  I  would  baptise  the 
children. 

I  hope  in  future  to  be  able  regularly  to  forward  to  you,  for 
the  information  of  your  friends,  an  account  of  my  mifJsion.  I 
have  kept  a  Journal,  Avhich  in  all  probability  will  be  published 
in  the  next  Annual  ileport  of  tlie  Toronto  Society,  Avith  those  of 
the  Missionaries  in  the  Home  and  Jlidland  Districts.  1  trust  the 
anu)unt  of  my  usefulness  (hunumly  speaking)  Avill  be  nearly  co- 
extensive witli  theirs,  from  the  plan  which  I  invariably  pursue 
(unless  prevented  by  circumstances  of  no  ordinary  kind),  of  ascer- 
taining, by  conversation  in  tlie  families  where  I  stop,  tlie  views 
and  opinions  of  the  difterent  members  ;  and  then  in  the  morning 
or  evening  prayin-  with  the  family,  I  select  suitable  portions  of 
Scripture,  wliich  I  press  upon  their  minds  by  a  strong  and  prac- 
tical application.  This  plan  I  have  found  in  many  instances 
already  to  have  been  attended  Avith  success.  I  have  also  en- 
deavoured to  impress  upon  their  minds,  more  particularly  under 
the  peculiar  cii.  instances  of  their  case,  the  duty  and  impor- 
tance of  family  av  .ship,  May  the  Lord  seal  Avith  his  most  holy 
spirit  every  effort  made  in  sincerity  to  promote  the  spread  of  his 
gospel,  and  to  Ilim,  Avith  the  Son,  be  all  the  glory  and  thanks-

Witli  respect  to  temporal  matters,  the  outlay  of  the  first 
year  falls  the  heaviest,  being  obliged  to  purchase  a  horse,  har- 
ness, &amp;o.,  &amp;c.  Clothes  also  are  an  expensive  article  here,  but 
my  salary  is  sulHcient  to  coverall  my  expeiices.  I  jiope  to  hear 
from  you  soon.  That  the  Lord  may  recognise  all  the  exertions 
of  yourself  unil  your  friends,  for  his  glory,  and  may  bless  you,

Third  Letter   from  the   Rer.    Thvwa?  Grnii,    TranUliKj  M'mlouary, 
London  District,  dated  JAhraari/  2Hrd,  Ui'^j. 

I  rejoice  to  liear  of  the  arrival  of  our  dear  and  Ifevereiid 
Bishop.  If  I  may  beallowod  to  jiulu'c,  hut  IV'w  (if  any)  are  tliere 
)vho  did  not  de('])ly  regret  tlie  neeeHsily  of  lii.s  (U-^jarture  from 
tlus  country  to  try  the  air  of  his  native  laud,  ^^'llerever  he  is, 
or  &gt;vhen.'V»ir  he  goes,  he  carrirs  with  him  tlie  sincere  legai'd  of 
all  classes  here,  and  many  a  lieartfeit  breathing  ascends  from 
this  vvihierness  to  the  throne  of  giaie,  piaying  iliat  he  uuiy  Net 
he  spared,  and  in  tlu&gt;  Lord's  good  time  restored  to  us  in  im- 
proved lu'allh  and  strength. 

As  to  my  JNlission  in  this  district,  all  things  seem  to  go  on 
prospjrou.sly.  In  many  phu.-es  tlie  gieatest  intercvst  has  l)een 
excited  by  the  proof  the  Mission  gives  tliat  thecliiidren  &lt;,f  "■  the 
Lord's.  Zion"  on  tlie  other  side  of  the  Atlaniic  have  not  foigotten 
their  brethr(»n  in  the  dejtths  of  the  forest  ;  and  are  no  longer 
iiidinjfd,  to  forget  the  scattered  sheep,  erring  and  .-traying  for  tiie 
want  of  some  to  teach  them  the  way  of  CJod  more  perfv'ctly, 
and  to  bring  to  tlieir  reniembiance  the  trutiis  taught  and  heard 
when  in  their  nujther  land  ;  and  many  join  nu*  in  tlie  jjrayer 
that  the  Lord  may  bless  liie  efforts  of  yourself  and  fi-iends,  and 
enable  you  fully  to  set  before  the  public  at  home,  tJie  spiritual 
destitution  of  this  country.  The  thought  occurred  to  me,  while 
j»erusing  your  letter,  that  if  we  were  to  calculate  the  number  of 
Fjpiscoi)alians  in  this  one  district,  larger  considerably  than  your 
largest  Diocese,  at  liOOO  only,  and  then  consiiki-  that  there  are 
but  six  Clergymen,  besides  myself,  to  minister  to  them  ;  the 
(•onvi(!tion  of  our  destitution  must  force  itself  ui)on  any  reflecting 
mind,  and  nuji-e  espcciiilly  wh(  a  we  call  to  miuil  the  distance  of 
the  congregations  in  the  dilferent  Settlements,  from  seven  to  ten 
or  twelve  miles  a]»art.  During  the  past  summer,  with  the  liope 
of  kee[)ing  together  the  con&gt;&gt;i-egations  that  1  collected,  and 
aifording  theni  an  opportunity  oi  iissembling  on  the  Lord's  Day, 
I  have  held  three  services  each  tSabbath— one  at  eh'ven  in  the 
morning  one  at  three- — and  one  at  six  in  the  evening,  havin^j; 
to  ride  from  ten  to  fifteen  miles  between  them,  which  1  felt  far 
mure  fatiguing  than  the  reading  or  preaching.  JSometimes,  also, 
on  the  same  day,  1  have  baptized  oJie  or  two  children,  using  the 
full  bai)tismal  service — you  may,  therefoie,  well  suppose  how 
tired  and  weary  1  have  lain  down  to  sleep  after  the  labours  of 
such  a  day.  To  the  present  time,  1  have  endeavoured  to  hold 
nmrning  service  in  Deieham,  and  innaediateiy  afterwards  rode 
to  Norwich,  a  distance  of  tliirteen  miles,  for  the  afternoon,  and 
to  some  other  Station  for  the  evening.  At  Norwich  the  service 
lias  been  held  in  the  house  of  a  Mr.  Davis,  from  Ireland,  who 
has  since  my  introduction  helped  me  forward  in  every  possible 
way  and  has  manifested  a  glowing  zeal  for  the  cause  of  our 
Redeemer,  and  the  prosperity  of  tlie  Church.  There  are  con- 
gregations now  at  I'ort  IJurwell  ami  the  village  of  Vienna,  in 
the  township  of  liayham,  suihcient  to  occupy  the  time  and 
attention  of  a  Clergyman  without  extending  to  other  paits  of 
the  township.  There  are  also  t)irei&gt;  congregations  m  liurford, 
four  and  five  miles  apart — an  ample  field,  without  considering 
the  re.-5t  of  the  towusliip,  for  the  services  of  one  Clergyman.

There  are  two  congregations  in  the  township  of  Norwich, 
and  one  in  Dereham,  thirteen  miles  distant,  whicli  would  fully 
engage  the  time  of  another  Clergyman,  not  including  the  small 
congregations  which  could  be  formed  in  remoter  parts  of  the 
to&gt;vnshii)  ;  you  may  judge,  tliercfore,  yourself  how  vei'y  imper- 
fectly these  stations  can  be  supplied  by  one  Clergyman  which 
aiford  an  ample  field  fur  three,  appointing  a  very  extensive  range 
of  duty  to  each.  In  this  arrangement  I  do  not  include  small 
congi-egations  which  I  have  in  other  townships  ;  nor  do  I  take 
at  all  into  account  those  townships,  six  in  number,  which  are 
supplied  with  a  resident  Clergymun.  These  facts  come  within 
my  own  knowledge,  as  within  my  own  range  of  duty.  I  have 
also  been  told,  in  the  township  of  London,  (irom  whence  I  date 
this)  inclusive  of  the  congregation  of  the  town,  amounting  to 
nearly  300,  or  perhaps  more,  in  different  i)arts  several  good 
congregations  could  be  formed  ;  and  if  a  Clergyman  were  placed 
near  the  sixteenth  concession,  one  from  300  to  400  could  be 
established — Emigrants  from  Ireland,  and  attached  to  the 
Church.  The  Ilev.  B.  Crouyn,  Hector  of  London,  sometime 
since  visited  them,  and  after  service  seventy  i)ersons  received 
the  Communion.  I  submit  these  few  statements  to  you,  not 
with  a  view,  believe  nie,  of  enhancing  my  own  poor  services, 
forth  our  difficulties  ;  but  solely,  and  with  the 
view  of  enabling  you  to  give  facts  to  your  fi-iends,  to 
prove  that  your  appeal  to  them  is  not  groundless — that  your 
tale  of  our  destitution  is  not  an  idle  one.  My  last  letter  would 
show  how  little  these  poor  Emigrants  arc  able  to  do  for  theiii- 
eelves,  in  regard  of  suppoiting  their  spiritual  -^uide  ;  since  that 
letter,  dated  October,  in  my  drives  and  wancierings  througli  our 
dense  forests,  I  have  become  acquainted  with  some  families 
once  your  neighbours  in  Northumberland.  After  morning 
service  at  Norwich,  accompanied  by  a  friend  to  direct  me,  J 
set  off  for  their  settlement  in  tlio  township  of  Dereham  ;  our 
route  lay  through  a  thick  forest  of  pines,  and  our  ride,  thougii 
lonely,  was  not  unpleasing  ;  our  conversation  chietiy  turned  on 
the  subject  of  my  wandering  mission,  and  tlie  kindness  of  those 
friends  at  the  other  side  of  the  Atlantic,  engaged  in  ministering 
to  their  spiritual  destitution — here  my  companion  more  than 
once  remarked,  how  much  it  rejoiced  him  to  think  that  the  time 
was  iioAV  not  far  distant,  when  again,  in  the  land  of  his  adoption, 
he  could  enjoy,  ar  formerly,  the  services  of  the  sanctuary  ;  and 
he  trusted  the  Lord  might  si)are  him  yet  to  see  a  Church  built 
in  his  neighbourhood,  and  that  near  it  his  bones  might  lie  when 
the  time  of  his  dissolution  arrived.  AVhen  we  reached  Dereliam 
it  was  nearly  dark,  and  unhappily  I  soon  foimd  that  the  "  notice" 
which  I  had  sent  out  some  days  before,  had,  through  some 
mistake,  never  reached  :  our  arrival  therefore  was  wholly 
unexpected — but  unexpected  as  it  was.,  I  soon  saw  that  it  gave 
the  greatest  satisfaction.  We  first  :-,ioi&gt;ped  at  tlie  house  of  a 
Mr.  Stroud,  but  l&gt;eing  in  the  hands  of  workmen,  he  could  not 
take  us  m  ;  he  took  us,  however,  at  once  to  a  neighbour,  Mr. 
13urrj,  who  gave  us  a  most  cordial  reception  ;  and  as  soon  as  we 
made  known  the  purport  of  our  visit,  he  borrowed  my  friend's 
horse,  and  sent  his  son   to  af)prise  the  families  in  the  neighboui--

hood  ;  and  I  was  not  loss  surprised  than  pleased  to  perceive, 
tliat  notwithstanding^  the  hurry  of  the  notice,  and  the  latenesH 
of  tiie  hour  of  a])pointment,  (eiglit  o'clock)  as  also  the  darknesn 
of  tlie  ni^dit,  from  forty  to  fifty  assembled.  IIavin;i;  exi)lained  t«) 
them  wliat  you  and  your  friends  are  endeavoiiriufj;  to  do  for 
them,  I  commenced  tiie  service,  and  Avas  much  /^ratified  to  hear 
the  responses  made  in  a  devout  and  audible  manner.  1  preached 
from  Acts  xvi.  and  the  last  clause  of  ver.  17-  Before  our  dis- 
missal, Mr.  Burn  made  to  his  noifthbours  a  few  very  api)roi)riate 
observations,  expressive  of  the  debt  of  ^'ratitude  they  owed  to 
tlieir  friends  at  home,  and  Ijoped  the  Gospel  Avoidd  )iot  be  sent 
to  them  in  vain.  In  my  ncKt  visit,  INIr.  Burn  (whom  I  believe 
to  bo  an  Israelite  indeed,)  told  me  tliat  he  considered  my  first 
visit  as  directed  l)y  Providence  ;  for  on  that  day  he  was  much 
distressed  in  mind,  in  consequence  of  some  of  his  children  who 
had  s])ent  the  early  part  of  the  day  otherwise  than  ho  had 
allowed  since  his  emigration,  and  very  differently  from  the 
Tnanner  they  had  l)een  accustomed  to  at  home  ;  and  he  attri- 
buted the  circumstance  to  the  melancholy  pronenoss  of  persona 
to  sjxmd  the  day  unprofitably,  in  conscquenec;  of  the  total 
absence  of  all  Sabbath  institutions,  and  its  result,  the  want  of 
Sunday  Schools,  lie  then  observed,  emigrants  who  leave  their 
homes,  in  tlie  hope  of  providing  comfcn-tably  for  their  families, 
were  too  little  careful  in  wliat  part  they  settled  ;  and  that  it 
should  bo  their  chief  desire  to  cast  in  their  lot  amongst  the 
rliildren  of  tlic  Lord,  and  wliere  the  means  of  grace  were 
afTbrded,  even  though  it  be  with  the  loss  of 
advantage.  At  my  next  visit  I  received  the 
persons  to  whom  you  were  known  ;  begging 
informed  tliat  they  were  part  of  my  scattered  Hock.  Service 
is  always  held  in  the  house  of  Mv.  Burn  ;  the  number  of  old 
country  people  is  about  sixty,  children  inc^ided.  On  thia 
occasion,  Mr.  Burn  speaking  in  reference  to  himself  and  a  few- 
others  from  yo\ir  county  of  Northumberland,  remarked,  although 
some  of  us  are  Dissenters,  we  have  the  most  friendly  feeling  to 
your  Church,  and  are  most  grateful  for  the  I  indness  you  offer 
to  us.  Having  no  Cliurch  of  our  own,  we  give  a  decided 
preference  to  the  Establishment,  and  greatly  prefer  attending 
its  services  and  ministrations  to  those  of  the  Dissenting  places 
of  worsliip  here.  We  have  been  accustomed  when  at  home  to 
hear  prayer  made  for  all  men — for  the  King  and  all  that  are  in 
authority— as  well  as  taught  to  be  thankful  for  the  blessings  we 
(nnoved  from  the  government  we  lived  under  ;  and  we  wish  our 
children  to  be  taught  as  we  have  been.  In  this  colony,  he  adds, 
they  have  reason  to  be  thankful  that  some  home  institutions  are 
res(M'ved  to'tliem  ;  and  now  we  are  exiles  from  our  native  land, 
,ind  have  no  longer  the  Church-going  bell — we  remember  witli 
melancholy  emotion  the  temples  where  our  fathers'  ashes  lie — 
the  Sabbath  privileges  and  opportunities  which  we  enjoyed  at 
home  ;  and  our  hearts  sicken  at  the  experience  of  the  lack 
which  your  kindnesses  are  now  first  striving  to  sui)pl3\  Ho 
added,  in  conclusion,  pray  tell  your  friends  and  employers  that 
we  hope  the  Gospel  will  not  be  sent  to  us  in  vain  ;  but  be  the 
means  of  gathering  us  to  hear  the  joyful  sound,  and  through  the

Chui'ch  at  Port  IJurw(dl.  A  petition  will  be  ftirwarded  in  a  day 
or  two  from  Norwich,  to  the  f;;overninent  in  council,  to  obtain  the 
possession  of  a  (Ilelx*  in  that  towjiship,  so  that  abstractiiiij  as 
much  as  will  be  necessary  for  the  site  of  a  (!hurch  and  Church- 
yard, the  remainder  nuiy  bo  sccuhmI  to  the  Settlors  in  tho  neigh- 
bourliood,  to  assist  tlunn  in  the  maintenjinco  of  a  Clor^^yman.  I 
have  also  rec(Mved  an  offer  of  &lt;&gt;frotin(l  for  a(/hurch  at  Burford, 
and  subscrii)tions  to  a  larjje  amount  have  been  promised,  not- 
withstandiuij^  tlie  extreme  scarcity  of  money  in  this  country  ;  one 
farmer,  a  Mr.  Moore  has  (tffered  AO  dollars  as  his  subscrij)tion— 
he  is  a  Canadian  and  very  warmly  attached  to  the  Church.  I  am 
banpy  to  iuld  that  my  visits  to  l)&lt;M-eIiam  have  not  been  without 
effec^t.  Our  friends  theie  are  not  idle,  and  I  trust  'ero  aTU)ther 
year  elapses,  from  two  to  four  Chui-ches  (Inmiblothoujrh  they  be) 
will  be  reared  in  tho  depth  of  our  Avoods  for  the  service  of  our 
reconciled  God.  If  you  think  it  advisable  yon  may  mention  this 
circumstance  to  their  friends  in  your  neij^hbonrhood,  addinj^  from 
them  that  the  most  triflitifjf  sum  would  bo  thardcfully  acco})tod, 
and  jT^ratefully  romeinbered  by  their  'rransatlantic  friends  and 
relatives.  A  short  time  sini'o  Mr.  Kviinsand  I  visited  tho  Nor- 
wich and  Dereham  Cionj^re-^rations  for  tho  ])urposp  of  administer- 
in;;'  the  Lord's  Supper,  but  as  ho  has  promised  to  write  to  you  an 
account,  I  will  not  add  particulars  now.  Wo  had  a  very  solemn 
and  I  hope  a  happy  time,  some  very  interesting  conversation 
passed  between  old  Mr.  Fletcher,  who  is  blind,  and  Mr.  Evans, 
expressinpf  the  comfort  it  was  in  his  latter  days  to  find  ere  he 
was  called  to  his  rest,  that  the  friends  at  homo  were  directinpr 
their  time  and  attention  to  tho  spiritual  destitution  of  the 
Emifj^rants. 

I  am  sorry  to  add  that  from  some  mistake  in  giving  me 
timely  notice,  I  am  apprehensive  that  my  journal  will  not  be 
published  with  those  of  the  Midland  and  other  Missions  in  the 
report  of  tho  Toronto  Society  this  year.  Should  it  so  happen 
that  it  is  not  in  time  for  them,  vv^onld  yon  choose  to  have  it  sent 
direct  to  you — if  you  think  its  publication  necessary  or  advisable 
for  the  information  of  your  friends  and  the  public,  1  will  forward 
it  to  you,  on  receiving  your  reply.  My  people  beg  me  to  give; 
their  grateful  thanks  for  the  ten  poimds  for  tracts  and  prayer 
books.  I  will,  with  the  Divine  permission,  endeavour  to  send 
yon  a  report  every  month  or  so,  and  will  be  careful  to  select  for 
you,  every  circumstance  calculated  to  interest  your  present 
friends  and  to  enlist  others  in  your  exertions  for  this  wretchedly 
destitute  country. 

I  should  not  omit  to  mention  that  an  instance  came  under 
my  own  eyes,  of  a  member  of  the  Church  travelling  nearly  40 
miles,  where  the  roads  were  very  bad,  for  the  purpose  of  oojh 
municating  in  the  Lord's  Supper.

Extract. — Fourth    Letter  from  the  Her.    Thnums    Green,    Trarell'mff 
M'tmovan/  in  the  London  DUtrlct,  to  W.  J.JJ.  1!'.,  dated  London, 

April  ml  1»;J7. 

M\  Dear  Kin, — It  was  with  feclinpfs  of  deep  sorrow  that  I 
read  that  part  of  your  letter  referring,'  to  another  inroad  upon  the 
health  of  our  beloved  Diocesan,  hut  1  had  the  comfort  a  few  days 
after  of  receivinj^  from  Mr.  Lockliart  an  improved  account,  that 
it  had  j)leased  tlie  Lord,  contrary  to  all  expectations,  to  raise  him 
once  more  from  tho  bed  of  sickness  to  a  stato  of  comparative 
health. 

Since  I  wrote  to  you  last,  I  have  had  an  offer  of  a  Church  at 
Simcoe,  now  a  district  town,  in  connection  with  the  superintend- 
ance  of  a  &lt;,'overnment  school.  The  terms  offered  to  nie  were  most 
liberal,  but  I  could  not  for  one  moment  think  about  it,  not  con- 
sidering"; myself  free  to  enter  into  any  fresh  arrangement,  l)ein&lt;; 
pledged  to  you  and  your  IViends  in  the  charge  to  which  the  Jjishop 
apponited  mo  ;  nor  indeed  do  I  feel  any  desire  to  enter  upon 
the  duties  of  sclujol-keeping,  unless  so  far  as  they  fall  within  my 
duty  as  a  preacher  of  the  (lospel.  As  to  to  any  collections  to  be 
made  among  my  Hock,  it  is  probable  enough,  tluit  were  there 
any  one  of  energy  and  system  to  employ  some  jjortion  of  their 
time  in  collecting,  much  in  the  end  might  be  done — but  I  would 
myself  much  prefer  receiving  a  less  salary  from  any  other  source 
wiiich  rendered  mo  independent  of  my  hearers,  than  the  promise 
of  a  larger,  arising  from  voluntary  and  consequently  uncertain 
contributions,  even  if  tlie  uncertainty  was  the  icorst  part  of  the 
Voluntary  System. 

Passmg,  however,  from  the  consideration  of  "  tho  Service  of 
Tables,"  I  will  endeavour  to  give  you  some  details  of  my  mission 
since  my  last  letter  of  Febru.ary  27th.  I  have  confined  my 
labours  for  the  last  month  to  the  town  and  township  of  liOndon. 
I  liad  not  the  most  distant  idea  that  there  were  so  many  l-lpisro- 
palians  as  I.  have  found  here.  The  congregations  vary  fioni  IH&gt; 
to  200,  and  it  is  to  be  remembered  that  this  is  an  attendance  not 
confined  to  any  ])ai  ticular  place,  but  the  number  assemljUnl  in 
different  parts  of  the  township.  With  the  exception  of  one 
congregation  near  tlie  Ilavins  Tract,  formed  of  persons  from  the 
adjacent  townshii)s  of  Bidduljdi  and  M'Gillavray. 

There  is  a  solenmity  and  decorum  apparent  which  is  truly 
gratifying,  during  the  time  of  Divine  Service.  Were  it  i)0ssible 
for  me,  or  any  other  minister,  to  attend  on  the  Sunda,ys  at  the 
15th  Concession,  a  very  large  congregati(m  miglit  b(;  expected. 
On  one  occasion  after  service  (my  visits  to  them  are  every  second 
Thursday)  a  respectable  old  man  said  to  me,  Sir,  if  you  could

coino  on  a  Sunday  to  us  you  wouM  find  a  vory  lar/jo  assomhlafj;*' 
to  nuM't  yo»i.  VVith  tlio  hoi)o  of  what  upjx'Hrr'!!  t«)  liiin  woul&lt;l  l»o 
a  jjroat  ^rutificiition  to  the  people,  I  promised  if  spured,  to  visit 
tlu^ni  for  on(«  or  two  SuiidiiVM,  prior  to  my  d(&gt;p:irture  for  anothnr 
purt  of  my  xteufsive  Mission.  'I'he  eoii^rej^ution  li(&gt;re  aro  prin- 
oipallv  Irish  from  tho  county  of  rippi^rary,  warmly  attached  to 
tho  Clmrch,  and  all  to  n  nuiii  devoted  to  IJritisli  rule — and  they 
proved  tluMr  loyalty  and  faithfulness  to  their  Kinj;  in  the  stru^- 
plo  which  was  to  decide  whether  this  colony  should  Im' continued 
to  the  Hritish  (yrowu,  or  /j;iven  up  to  the  iron  ruhiof  a  &lt;lisafte(!tod 
oligarchy.  To  those  who,  as  all  (Mu-istians  do,  hold  that  God's 
true  worship  in  the  only  cenuMit  which  hinds  society  lo^etlier, 
it  is  needless  to  remark  the  iinjiortance  of  nayinji;  incn^ased 
attention  to  that  point  her(\  1  will  transcribe  the  notie(!  of 
this  first  visit  in  this  Quarter,  from  my  Journal.  Thursday, 
March  2nd,  I  drove  to  the  14th  Ooncession,  and  lield  Divine 
Service  in  tho  house  of  Widow  Ifod^^'ins.  'j'he  coufrre^'ation  was 
very  largo  and  attentive,  I  suppose  not  less  than  ir»()  persons 
present — a  jj^roat  attendance  for  this  conntry  so  scattered  and 
remote  aro  their  dwelliniifs  in  the  woods.  I  was  told  by  Mrs. 
Jtodiifins,  who  is  fully  Acquainted  with  tho  neighbourhood,  that 
all  my  hearers  wen.)  Ej)i.scopalians  with  one  exception — after 
service  four  children  were  bajjtizod — and  it  is  greatly  to  bo 
lamented  that  when  so  ample  a  field  presents  itself,  "  white  for 
tho  harvest," — and  with  every  prospect  of  a  blessing  upon  the 
work,  more  effectual  means  arc  not  taken  to  extend  theChrii^'tian 
Fold — I  might  say  to  present  its  desolation.  Some  interesting  con- 
versation followed  tho  administration  of  Baptism — one  of  the 
•'oui^'nigution  observed,  "you  see.  Sir,  how  large  a  congregation 
will  assemble,  if  yon  give  us  opportunity — surely  wo  ought  not 
to  be  foi'gotten  or  so  neglected — and  if  we  are,  it  can  have  but 
one  issue — Wi'i  must  seek  Chi'istian  Ordinances  where  wo  can 
find  them,  and  it  will  be  no  fault  of  ours  that  wo  desert  a  Churcli 
which  wo  love— but  whose  services  we  cannot  attain,"  Another 
hearer  made  a  few  remarks  upon  the  subject  of  my  sermon  in  a 
simple  and  pleasing  manner— May  the  Lord  soon  raise  up  and 
place  among  them  a  zealous  and  faithful  servant — it  is  grievous 
to  think  (and  yet  it  is  impossible  to  avoid  it)  how  much  ii  iiey 
is  hivi.shod  in  the  pursuit  of  worldly  honours  and  pleasures,  the 
inere  tithe  of  which,  expended  in  the  service  of  the  Gospel, 
would  render,  under  the  Divine  blessing,  the  greatest  good- 
(&gt;h  !  that  they  even  who  daily  pray  "  Thy  kingdom  come"  would 
candidly  ask  their  own  hearts,  in  looking  at  the  state  of  Canad;i, 
whether  they  could  not  have  done  more  in  furtherance  of  "  That 
Kingdom." 

I  visited  this  congregation  again  on  Thursday,  March  14tli. 
The  road  was  in  a  miserable  state,  owing  to  the  thaw,  I  read 
prayers  and  preached  to  above  200  persons,  many  having  walked 
several  miles  to  attend  ;  and  one  woman  in  particular,  declared 
the  had  cowe  ehjhtirn  m'des  for  the  purpose  of  getting  her  child 
baptized.  She  left  home  the  previous  evening  and  walked  six 
miles,  and  the  other  twelve  she  walked  in  the  morning  befoi" 
service — and  for  six  miles  out  of  this  twelve,  she  did  not  sec  a 
single  house.    I  baptized  three  children.    Immediately  after  ser-

these  feelings  ;  but  it  is  jjjladdeninjj^  and  iMir(»inii^in&lt;^  to  tlu?  heart 
when  thi«  Lord  makes  use  of  a  fe(&gt;l)le  worm  to  (•&lt;»mfort  or  con- 
vert, and  vouchsafes  to  sliew  his  acceptaiu'e  of  the  humblest 
labour  for  J  lis  f^lory. 

On  the  JKHh  of  March  J  visited  them  a  third  time  ;  tlio  rouds 
were  very  deep,  and  travelliuji;  slow  and  iinccunfortable  in  sleet 
and  rain.     I  did  not  expect  to  find  a  birpe  eon{i;re^ation  assem- 
hled,  and  was  ajjreeably  surjirised,  in  su(  h  weather,  to  see  from 
KJO  to  Um  present,  all  aipparently  anxious  to  hear  the  Word  of 
Trntlj.     Many  were  obli;j;e(l  to  stand  (luiin*,'  the  time  of  service 
and  sermon  for  lack  of  seats.     Durini,'  the  service  I  was  much 
struck  with  the  appearance  &lt;&gt;f  a  very  old  woman,  wlu)  sat  near 
the  place  I  occupied  ;  she  seetned  tlirouj,diout  deeply  attentive, 
and  endeavoured  to  join,  and  from  her  heart,  too,  while  sin^inj^ 
the  34th  Psalm.     After  service  1  had  some  conversation  with  her ; 
she  told  me  she  was  73  years  old,  and  had  walked  three  miles  to 
attend.     The  day  was  cold,  with  heavy  scpialls  of  snow,  and   J 
could  not  but  call  to  mind  the  contrast   between  this  poor  aired 
disciple  and  the  many  nuuiy  instances  in  which   such  weather 
would  have  been  deemed  a  suflficieut  excuse  for  aosencefi-om  the 
sanctuary,  witluuit  the  additional  impediment,  she  had  of  almost 
impassable  roads.    She  was  accoini)anied  l»y  a  dauf,diter,  a  f^rand 
daujifhter,  and  a  grand  sonjfrowu  »ip,and  a  little  tjirat  j,M-and  child. 
I  was  glad  to  liave  cause  to  hope  thai  if  all  my  congregation 
were  not  altogether  true  Israel,  there  were  very  many,  who  if 
they  were  debarred  tlm  outward  form,  had,  at   least,  in   their 
hearts,  the  power  of  Godliness.   Having  reuuirked  to  one  of  them 
my  astonisjiment,  that  in  such  a  season  so  many  should  have  us- 
semf»led — "  Oh,  sir,  you  little  know  what  a  joy  it  is  to  us,  to  have 
any  oj)portunity  of  joining  iu  f  ln'  ])ublic  worsliip  of  our  Church- 
It  is  an  f^njoyment  tooseldoio  oft'ered  to  us."     In  tiiis  township 
and  throii  ^hout  the  ueighln     ••hood,  perhaps  it  would  be  much 
below  till    uumber  to  say   ti    re  are   IJtH)    Church    [)eople   so 
scattered  ii     to  attoid  an  nmpU  field  for  three  resident  Clergy- 
men— but  ;-  js  !  1  am  tlie  only  C'Icrgyi   an  f&lt;»r  ina\iy  miles  ;  and 
such  are  the  roads,  that  ro  visit  a  single  family,  to  soothe  with 
the  ])recious  comforts  of  liie  word  of  God — the  pillow  of  the  sick, 
is  in  itself  a  sufficient  day's  "  »rk.     I  think,  could  means  be  found 
to  locate  faithful  Ministers  ai()ong  them  who  coul&lt;l  iVom  govern- 
ment, or  from  any  other  souix-e,  obtain  a  small  sum  dwring  a 
short  period,  as  1  do  from  you,  indepen  lent  of  what  might  be 
collected  amongst  the  respective  congrc  .   tions,  t  nat  much  might 
be  done,  and  that  in  a  very  short   time  and  gradually  such  aid 
might  accomplish  the  object,  and.  if  not  entirely,  be  nearly  with- 
drawn.    I  am  nea»'\'"  certain,  from  my  own  obsi'rvation,  the  poor 
Emigrant,  as  his  uio.ios  increased,  would  not  be  unwilling  to 
contribute  his  miti   i..  -he  maintenance  cf  his  Minister  (though 
at  first  it  is  utterl\   'riiiossible,)  and  more  particularly   were  it 
impressed  upon  hia  luiad  at  first  settling,  or  before  leaving  home,

that  such  provision  would  bo  required  of  him  and  expected  after 
a  specified  time.  I  am  convinced  many  obstacles  must  arise  and 
present  themHelves  daily  to  you,  anxious,  as  you  have  sl-cv.-n 
yourself,  to  assist  them,  and  to  aid  tln^  s))read  of  the  {^huoua 
_u;0Hi)el  in  these  woods  ;  and  I  liave  little  doubt  it  may  occvjr  to 
t!ie  minds,  and  j)erhai)s  be  openly  objected  by  many  to  whom 
you  are  daily  callin;,ranJ  makinfj  your  appeals  in  furtherance  of 
the  work.  Why  cannot  the  Episcoi)al  coTumunity  equally  pro- 
vide thems(dvos  Mini.stta's  as  the  Dissenters  do  for  theirs  ?  Wero 
they  here  for  a  short  time  it  would  teach  them  tluTt  tlie  Dissent- 
ing Ministry  in  tliis  country  are  not  supitorted  by  funds  raised 
here,  till  much  previous  outlay  has  been  nuvde — and  till  a  settle- 
ment is  in  a  state  of  considerable  advancement.  The  sinews  of 
their  warfare  come  from  En}i;land,  and  large  sums  annually  sent 
and  ])laced  at  tlie  disposal  of  the  conference  for  the  purpose  of 
planting  and  supporting.  The  infant  Seed-Missions  require  the 
same  attention  as  children — and  it  is  folly  to  expect  them  to 
thrive  by  neglect,  or  without  a  nurse — and  I  am  })erfectly  sure 
that  no  denomination  of  JMinisters,  unless  as  individuals  they 
have  sufticient  private  means,  could  by  any  possibility  be  sup- 
])orted  by  contributions  levied  here.  But  besides  this,  there  is 
another  strong  point  of  difference  to  be  considered — Dissenters 
arc  used  to  the  plan,  and  consequently  are  in  some  degree,  pre- 
pared by  habit  at  home  for  such  a  state  of  things,  whereas 
members  of  tlie  Church  bring  their  habits  of  thinking  too — the 
plan  is  a  novelty  to  them — they  have  been  used  to  their  parish 
Church  and  the  services  of  tlie  sanctuary  without  any  cost,  and 
they  come  here  expecting  to  find  the  same  provision,  at  least,  in 
some  degi-ee — and  it  cannot  be  expected  in  such  circumstances 
to  find  the  sameprom])titudein  subscribing  as  in  those  who  have 
been  accustomed  to  it  all  their  lives.  I  do  not  mean  to  intimate 
(for  I  am  sure  it  is  not  true)  that  the  members  of  our  Church  arc? 
unwilling  to  support  their  Ministers,  when  they  have  it  in  their 
power — as  they  do  at  Trafalgar — and  as  they  offer  to  do  at 
Wellington-Square  to  my  own  knowledge — and  I  have  not  a 
doubt  that  there  are  many  other  places  where  the  same  disposi- 
tion exists  ;  but  the  majority  of  the  Emigrants  are  so  poor  that 
they  are  ivholly  iinahle  to  contribute,  and  consequently  too  heavy  a 
burden  is  tlirown  upon  the/;?c  that  can.  According  to  my  view 
of  the  passage  "  To  the  poor  the  gospel  is  preached," — This  is 
just  the  state  of  things  in  which  tlieu^e  of  an  established  Church 
greatly  consists' — and  every  country  which  has  received  the 
gospel  under  the  fostering  care  of  its  jiredecessors,  is  bound  by 
every  principle  of  Christian  love,  to  extend  the  same  fostering 
care  to  the  colonies  she  sends  out,  until  they  are  able  "  To  stand 
by  themselves." 

But  to  speak  the  truth  our  Settlers  are  not  only  destitute  of 
wealth,  but  mainly  ignorant  of  those  riches  which  abide  for  ever 
— and  how  can  it  be  otherwise  ?  "  How  shall  they  hear  without 
a  Preacher,  and  how  shall  they  preach  if  they  be  not  sent  ?'' 
Great  is  the  ignorance  and  darkness  which  prevails — very  many 
come  out  here — and  more  are  born  liere  and  brought  up,  grossly 
ignorant  of  the  most  simple  truths  of  the  gospel — and  thus 
ignorant,  they  slumber  on,  with  none  to  awaken  them,  in  a  state  of

prove  in  the  stronj^est  possible  light  the  absolute  necessity  of

in  a  great  portion  of  my  flocks  beyond  human  conce])tion—  it  is 
no  less  astonishing  tliaii  it  is  deplorable.  To  give  you  sonu?  f:iiiit 
idea  of  it,  I  cannot  do  better  than  give  you  an  extract  from  my 
journal. 

Good  Friday  ISIarch  24th,  after  divine  service  in  the  town  of 
Ijondou,  1  rode  a  few  miles  to  visit  a  man  from  Ireland,  who  A\as 
considered  to  be  dying  ;  I  found  him  sitting  up  ;  uponeiKpiiriiig 
whether  he  was  afraid  to  die,  he  paused — and  then  said,  were 
he  spared  afortnhjht ,  he  thought  he  would  be  prepared  to  die  ; 
from  this  and  some  other  answers,  his  ignorance  of  tlie  gospel 
truth  appeared, and  with  much  plainness  of  speech  lendcavoured 
(looking  for  aid  and  a  blessing  from  the  holy  spirit,)  to  set  before 
him  the  way  of  salvation,  I  explained  to  him  the  nature  of  sin, 
of  the  law,  of  the  inestimable  love  of  God,  in  the  redemption  of 
the  world  by  our  Loi'd  Jesus  Christ,  justification  by  faith,  not  of 
works,  and  the  nature  of  sanctification.  After  conversing,  j)er- 
haps  more  than  an  hour,  I  commended  him  in  prayer  to  a 
covenant  keejiing  God.  Before  I  left  the  house,  the  sick  man 
observed  with  thankfulness,  oh  !  sir,  this  has  been  the  6ej'/  i^islt  for 
my  soul  tliat  ever  I  received.  There  were  a  few  strangers  prc- 
ficnt  who  seemed  to  listen  very  attentively — two  children  were 
then  baptized.  I  have  not  been  able,  from  other  calls,  to  visit 
him  since,  but  heard  he  was  gathering  strength  daily,  but  I  hope 
to  do  it  shortly,  and  be  able  to  inform  you  in  my  next  letter  how- 
he  goes  on. 

On  the  Gth  of  March,  I  took  an  opportunity  of  visiting  the 
riev.  R.  Flood,  Missionary  at  Delaware,  in  whose  proceedings 
you  take  a  lively  interest ;  the  Lord  has  blessed  him,  as  you 
know,  in  the  formation  of  a  congregation  of  liidians  in  Monsec 
Town.  With  very  little  aid  he  has  built  a  small  Mission  house, 
in  which,  if  spared,  he  hopes  to  dwell  for  the  summer,  humbly 
expecting  to  be  more  useful  to  them  by  his  residence  among 
them.  It  is  cheering  to  hear  the  hand  of  the  Lord  is  with  him, 
ill  convincing  and  converting  many  obstinate  sinners  of  this  in- 
teresting tribe.  The  badness  of  the  roads  and  the  state  of  tlie 
weather  prevented  our  visiting  the  Indian  village  during  my 
short  and  h'lrried  visit  to  him.  There  are,  I  think,  eitlier  eight 
or  nine  candidates  for  baptism,  and  I  have  reason  to  believe  afid 
hope  all  truly  converted  to  Christ.  Mr.  F.  speaks  very  highly  of 
an  old  chief,  named  Snake,  who,  by  the  consistency  of  his  walk, 
adorns  the  gospel  he  has  professed — he  acts  as  intei-preter  and 
is  in  great  estimation  through  the  whole  tribe — his  inlliieiice

over  the  minds  of  his  poor  benif,'hted  brethren  may  bo  of  eminent 
advantajfo  to  tlio  Mission.     While  I  was  with  Mr.  F.  ono  of  the 
chiefs,  Captain  Fox,  accompanied  by  his  son  (a  fine  younn^  man,) 
in  their  way  home  from  a  iiuntin}^  expedition,  called  to  see  the 
*  Black  t'oatf  as  they  call  all  Clergymen.     I  had  some  conversa- 
tion with,  him ;  he  spoke  I'^nglish  fluently,  havinjr  l)een  appointed 
a  war  chief,  which  threw  him  much  into  the  society  of  the  Knj^lish 
throu^'hout  the  fearful  struf^f^le.     Mr.  F.  ;,'ot  Mrs.  F.  to  play  the 
hymn,  "Grace  is  a  charmin}^  sound."     We  all  joined — neither 
the  chief  nor  his  son  had  ever  heard  or  seen  a  pianaforte  bo- 
fore.     They  were  evidently  both  astonished,  (thoufrh  it  is  one  of 
the  peculiarities  of  the  Indian  character,  not  to    express  the 
8li{j;htest  amazement  upon  any  occasion,)  and  greatly  delighted. 
As  soon  as  we  had  closed  the  singing,  Captain  Fox  remarked 
"  That  makes  me  feel  sorry,"  pointing  at  the  same  time  to  the 
instrument.   Upon  Mr.  F.  asking  liim  wliy  ?  he  replied  "  It  made 
him  think  of  God."     (Rush  anionadu.)     Mr.  F.  receives  no  salary 
as  their  Missionary,  but  so  fully  is  he  interested  in  the  Mission, 
that  I  think,  were  the  Indians  to  withdraw  to  a  more  distant 
Hottlement,  he  would  give  up  liis  appointment  amongst  the  white 
Settlers  at  Delaware,  and  ciist  in  his  lot  with  tliem.    Although 
his  means  are  very  limited,  still  the  red  man  is  ever  sure  to  share 
his  fireside  and  his  table.     I  have  promised,  if  possible,  to  assist 
at  the  bai)tism,  and  shall,  God  willing,  forward  all  particulars  to 
you. 

These  Indians  are  so  desirous  of  having  a  Teacher  of  that 
Church  to  which  their  Great  Father  (the  King)  belongs,  thut 
they  have  agreed  in  council  to  grant  200  acres  of  land  ;  but 
unless  the  Government,  or  some  friends  of  Missions  will  provide 
a  salary,  I  appreliend  no  Missionary,  unpossessed  of  private 
means,  can  at  present  be  provided  by  the  Society  at  Toronto— 
I  know  you  will  help  them,  if  you  can.  I  have  been  informed 
that  Mr.  Jones,  Agent  for  the  Canadian  Company,  has  offered 
200  acres  and  the  lumber  for  a  Church,  in  the  county  of  Huron, 
provided  the  people  promise  to  maintain  a  Clergyman  by  sub- 
scription in  money  or  produce.  I  have  been  prevented  by  my 
work  here  from  visiting  our  English  friends  at  Norwich  and 
Dereham  since  I  last  wrote,  but  hope  to  be  again  amojigst  them 
soon. 

Allow  me  again  to  thank  you  for  sending  the  Record  so 
regularly,  there  is  a  small  unavoidable  charge  if  sent  by  New 
York,  but  as  it  is  the  quickest  way,  I  have  the  greatest  pleasure 
in  paying  it.  It  affords  a  rich  feast  to  us,  who,  roaming  in  the 
forest,  still  feel  anxious  to  know  what  the  religious  part  of  your 
community  are  doing  ;  and  it  affords  an  interest  and  a  gratifica- 
tion, not  to  myself  alone,  but  to  my  people,  and  thereby  helps 
my  progress.     I  pray  the  Lord  may  bless  you  and  yours. 

Your's  very  faithfully, 

THOMAS  GREEN.

As  soon  as  I  hear  from  the  Bishop  of  Montreal,  I  mean  to

foricarded  by  him  to  Mr.  \V.,  dated  London,  Ui'ver  Cunuda,  May

ters evidence  a  growinj^    attuelinient    to    the  bervi&lt;;es  of    our 
Clnirch,  and  wore  many  faithful  and  zealous  ministers,  of  mild 
and  conciliating  manners  to  settle  amon^'  us,  very  soon,  1  tliink, 
our  con^re{j;ations  would  increase  and  our  houses  of  worship  be 
filled.    My  plan  seems  to  succeed  very  well.     1  visit  from  houso 
to  house  as  often  as  my  numerous  en;;agements  will  j)ermit,  and 
to  make  my  visits  as  profitable  as  possible,  1  endeavour  to  brinjj 
all   thin^^s  to  bend  to  Christ.     1  am  astonished  that  so  little 
Biiould  be  known  of  this  country  and  its  Avants,  presenting,  as  it 
does,  so  ami)le  a  field  for  missionary  labour,  and  with  a  prospect 
(humanly  speaking)  of  sucii  abundant  success.     May  the  Lord 
fill  the  hearts  of  all  who  say  "  Thy  kingdom  com'*,"  with  more 
earnest  zeal  for  the  jjromotion  of  His  glory  here.     In  the  ab- 
sence of  the  Kev.  B.  Cronyn,  I  have  confined  my  labours  for 
some  time  to  the  town  and  township  of  liondon,  with  the  gore  of 
the  said  township.    The  congregations  are  very  large,  aliording 
an  extensive  field  of  labour,  for  at  least  three  hard  working  mis- 
sionaries.    I  think  the  Episcopalians  may  be  calculated  at  from 
3000  to  4000,  including  the  adjoining  parts  of  J3iddulj)li  and 
M'Gillavray.     The  people  se'in  very  anxious  to  secure  the  ser- 
vices of  a  fixed  ministev  in  the  sixteenth  concession.     I  am  sure 
an  ample  provision,  as  far  as  i)roduce  could  supply,  might  be  cal- 
culated upon  ;  but  I  am  not  prepared  to  say  what  sum  of  money 
besides,  they  would,  or  could,  collect.    I  have  had  many  offers, 
but  I  do  not  for  one  moment  think  of  accepting  any  engage- 
ment, until  the  period  of  my  i)resent  mission  shall  have  expired. 
May  the  Great  Head  of  tJie  Church  give  me  strength,  and  in- 
crease my  love  for  His  service  !     There  are  openings  for  minis- 
ters at  Port  Bur  well  and  Vienna,  with  the  neighbouring  parts — 
Burford,  Dereham,  Norwich,  Walpole,  and  tlie  Huron  Tract. 
Ministers  in  these  townships  could  act  as  pioneers  ;  and  I  trust 
very  rapidly,  mission  stations  could  be  opened.    I  cannot  now 
say  what  sums  they  could  contribute  to  the  maintenance  of 
clergymen,  for  money  is  very  scarce  among  them.     The  most 
adviseable  plan  would  be  to  fill  up  these  places  with  men  prepared 
to  rough  it,  active  and  in  their  hearts  alive  and  devoted  to  the 
work.    It  is  not  sufficient  for  a  clergyman  to  give  up  Sunday  to 
the  work  of  the  ministry,  here  every  day  must  be  Sunday  to 
him.     I  have  had  as  numerous  congregations  on  the  week-days 
as  on  the  Sabbaths.    The  minds  also  of  those  who,  from  neces- 
sity, have  fallen  into  dissent,  ought  to  be  prepared  by  short  lec- 
tures on  the  services  of  the  Church,  so  that  the  charge  so  fre- 
quently made,  that  our  prayers,  &amp;.c.,  are  cold  and  formal,  may 
be  practically  answered.    Perhaps  also  some  small  allowance 
from  government  might  be  obtained,  exclusive  of  the  allotted 
portion  of  land,  which  you  are  aware  will  require  labour,  time, 
and  cost,  to  become  productive  of  any  benefit  to  a  clergyman. 
Could  any,  if  not  all,  these  hints  be  carried  ii^po  effect,  we  might 
look  forwards,  under  the  Divine  blessing,  for  prosperity  and

Suth  Letter  from  the  Iter.  Thomas  Greeny  Stcvart  Tr&lt;ixeU.ing  Mis- 
sionary, London  District. 
Norwich,  London  District,  Ufper  Canada,  Auj.  Urd,  1837. 
Dear  Siu, — I  regret  want  of  time  prevented  my  acknow- 
ledging your  letters  of  the  17th  of  April  and  17th  of  May— but 
you  must  never  be  surprised  (however  important  they  may  be 
to  my  comfort  and  well  being)  if  your  letters  are  not  immediately 
answered,  for  I  often  have  no  opportunity  of  receiving  them 
until  I  have  finished  a  route  of  visits  through  the  different 
Mission  Stations,  and  completed  all  my  appointments  in  that 
quarter.  Again  allow  me  to  ex])ress  my  obligations  to  yourself 
and  friends,  for  your  unremitting  consideration  of  my  pecuniary 
wants,  under  the  unavoidable  difficulties  residting  from  the 
illness  of  our  beloved  Bishop.  I  am  happy  to  inform  you  that 
the  Lord  Bishop  of  Montreal,  in  accordance  with  your  instruc- 
tions, empowered  me  in  May  to  draw  on  Mr.  Wood,  Treasurer 
of  "  The  Toronto  Society  for  converting  and  civilizing  the 
Indians,  and  propagating  the  Gospel  among  the  destitute 
Settlers,"  for  £5i)  currency,  on  your  account.  It  came  most 
acceptably,  as  my  wants  had  become  multiplied  and  pressing. 
There  is  one  feature  in  both  your  letters  to  which  I  wish  to  call 
your  attention — you  seem  to  apprehend  that  my  present  tem- 
I)orary  employment  at  London,  to  supply  the  services  of  Mr. 
Crony n  took  me  i'rom  the  scattered  Jiock,  the  main  object  of  your- 
self and  friends,  and  that  my  time  has  been  devoted  to  a  gathered 
congregation.  Upon  this  head  you  may  rest  assured,  that, 
although  from  the  period  of  Mr.  Cronyn's  departure,  I  have 
generally  held  morning  service  on  Sunday  in  London,  still  my 
Tratelling  Mimon  has  been,  and  is  carried  on  as  zealously, 
constantly,  and  I  humbly  trust  as  faithfully  now,  as  at  any 
period  ;  and  I  hope  the  Stewart  Missionary  has  the  Word  of 
the  Lord  as  mixch  at  heart,  and  labours  as  abundantly  as  any 
Missionary  in  our  desolate  wilderness.  A  communication  waa 
left  for  me  with  Mr.  Evans,  the  Rector  of  Woodhouse,  sanction- 
ing my  transfer  of  quarters  from  Simcoe  to  London  by  the 
Bishop  of  ^Montreal,  during  the  absence  of  Mr.  C,  who  was 
appointed  a  delegat(;  to  England  to  help  in  the  good  cause,  and 
to  set  more  fully  before  the  British  public  our  spiritual  destitu- 
tion.   Agreeably  with  your  strict  injunctions  of  obedience  to

matter,  not,  I  assure  yon,  in  the  langunge  of  complaint,  but  that 
you  and  your  friends  knowing  the  object  of  your  Ni'U'urt  Mimorif 
is  not  defeated,  nor  the  desire  of  your  hearts  as  to  thi:  scattered 
Hocks  disregarded,  your  minds  might  be  strengthened  and  cheered 
to  go  forward  in  your  work  of  christian  love  for  the  amelioration 
of  that  woeful  spiritual  destitution  in  which  the  Settlers  and 
ethers  in  this  province  live.  Under  the  Divine  blessing  I  have 
visited  the  townshij)s  of  IJiddulph,  M'Gillavray,  and  Osborn,  in 
the  Huron  Tract,  since  my  last  letter  of  April,  and  have  made 
four  new  a])pointments,  comprising  in  these  townships  with 
that  of  London  nine  regular  stations,  which  I  visit  every  fort- 
niglit.  The  congregations  are  uumerous  and  attentive,  and 
api)ear  to  be  deeply  interested  in,  and  gratified  by,  my  visits. 
After  giving  expression  to  their  pleasure  in  the  most  affecting 
manner,  and  their  sympathy  in  the  fatigue  I  must  necessarily 
undergo  upon  my  journeys  to  their  secluded  dwellings,  words, 
they  say,  cannot  describe  their  gratitude  to  those  who  have 
remembered  them  in  their  affliction, — and  you  may  believe  me 
all  sense  of  my  o^vn  labour  and  fatigue  is  forgotten  among  such 
cordial  greetings.  Up  to  the  present  time  your  Mission  seems 
to  go  on  most  prosperously,  and  I  trust  will  long  tend  to  conse- 
crate the  remembrance  of  Bishop  Stewart  in  this  wild  wihlerness. 
Your  Missionary  too  has  cause  for  the  deepest  gratitude  in 
liaving  been  made  the  humble  instrument  in  gathering  in  so 
many  places  the  scattered  sheep  into  settled  congregations,  and 
still  more  so  that  a  blessing  appears  to  accompany  the  preaching 
of  the  Gospel.  This  is  a  fact  which  truly  calls  for  our  thanks- 
giving at  a  throne  of  Grace,  and  not  the  mere  circumstance  of 
keeping  members  attached  to  the  Church,  however  apostolic 
she  may  be  in  descent  and  doctrine.  When  not  only  the  form 
of  Godliness,  but  also  the  jmrer  is  apparent,  Avhat  comfort  does 
it  not  bring  to  the  mind  of  the  labourer  in  the  Lord's  vineyard — 
what  joy  does  it  not  shed  abroad  upon  all  his  ministrations  and

London,  Awiust  'ith. 
May  the  Lord  soon  hasten  the  time  when  many  faithful  men 
may  be  raised  up  amongst  you  and  be  sent  to  us,  resolving  to  know 
nothing  among  men,  but  "  Jesus  and  llim  crucified,"  and  who 
led  by  the  spirit's  teaching  may  be  found  not  shrinking  from  tho 
labours  of  a  missionary  life  ;  however  severe  and  arduous  they 
may  bo  ;  })rivations  and  sufferings  must  be  endured  here,  but 
what  after  all  are  they  compared  with  those  of  a  Martyn,  an 
Elliott,  or  a  Neff.    Here  no  time  is  lost  in  acquiring  the  know- 
ledge of  a  new  tongue — immediately  the  glorious  embassy  may 
be  commenced,  and  numbers  found  daily  eager  to  hear  the  word 
of  salvation.     Could  you  and  your  many  friends  have  witnessed 
the  satisfaction  afforded  by  the  imexpected  presence  of  your 
Stewart  Missionary  in  the  Hui-on  Tract  some  weeks  ago,  1  am 
led  to  think  you  would  not  consider  us  unworthy  of  your  in- 
terest ;  for  laying  aside  the  higher  motive,  the  humble  hope  of 
being  made  instrumental  in  the  hands  of  God  to  promote  His 
glory  and  extend  His  kingdom — there  was  enough  to  touch  the 
coldest  heart.     Happening  to  be  in  the  neighbourhood  to  keep 
an  appointment,  the  wife  of  a  member  of  the  Church  died  rather 
Huddeuly,  and  although  bitter  was  the  draught,  and  deep  and 
heavy  appeared  the  blow  to  the  bereaved  members  of  the  faniil}-, 
I  believe  I  may  tnily  affirm,  that  their  poignant  sorrow  lost 
great  part  of  its  bitterness  from  the  unexpected  thought  that 
the  dear  remains  would  be  committed  to  its  cold  clayey  bed 
with  all  the  order  and  decorum  of  a  christian  burial— this  to 
eome  may  appear  unimportant,  but  not  so  was  it  to  the  frionds, 
nor  to  me,  for  I  had  at  the  grave's  mouth  an  opportunity  of  jiro- 
claiming  "  the  blessings  of  those  who  die  in  the  Lord."     Tho 
whole  scene  was  solemn  and  grand — the  place  set  ajmrt  for  a 
burial  ground  was  skirted  by  a  large  wood  clad  with  a  rich  foliage ; 
the  sky  clear  ;  the  sun  shone  out  brightly  ;  the  air  calm  ;  nature 
seemed  to  breathe  a  sort  of  holy  melancholy  stillness — here, 
dear  sir,  to  not  less  I  should  think  than  140  persons  I  preached 
Jesus,  and  shewed  that  "  they  who  believe  in  Him  should  never 
die" — all  seemed  to  listen  with  deep  attention — to  me  it  was  a 
solemn  refreshing,  though  almost  overpowering  season  of  the 
pre/senc©  of  the  Lord  ;  and  although  I  had  a  very  long  ride  tlie

foUowinjif  (lay  to  koop  ft  previous  Appointmont ;  I  joumryod  on 
nioasantly  and  uiiwfarii'd  from  tho  n!collocti«ms  of  the  ,sc«&gt;no. 
iJpon  anotlu'roc(Mi.sion,  I  liad  srated  inyHtdf  quietly  with  a  family, 
aftor  tho  labours  of  the  day,  when  a  Htranprr  cntcrod  and  handod 
uio  a  note,  on  opening  it  1  found  a  roqiioHt  to  attciul  tlio  funeral 
of  his  dear  departed  kou.     The  distance  which  the  stranger  had 
travelled  was  about  2r»  miles,  havin}^  sif^nifi(&gt;d   my  readiness  to 
accompany  him    the  foUowinj,'  morninfjf ;   he  appeare&lt;l    deeply 
pratilied,  and  on  my  arrival  the  following  day  at  one  o'clock,  I 
was  most  cordially  j];reoted  by  tho  family  and  assembled  friends. 
In  numy  similar  ways  could  I  enumerate  how  freciuently  tho 
presence  of  a  Clerjfyman  has  aft'orded  the  most  unfeif^ned  satis- 
faction ;  and  the  people  feel  well  assured,  were  it  not  for  tho 
efforts  of  your  friends  in  assistiuj*  their  now  lost  Bishop,  no  such 
opportunity  would  in  all  liuman  probability  have  been  speedily 
afforded  to  them.     About  a  fortnij^lit  since,  I  discovered  a  very 
larpe  settlement  of  Enj^lish  peojjle  from  Bouth  Devon,  oij^liteen 
families  amounting  to  one  hundred  and  eleven,  children  included 
— there  are  foJir  Irish  families  located  near  them,  numberinj*  in 
all  one  hundred  and  fifty  ;  they  occupy  a  space  of  about  throe 
miles  ahmg  each  side  of'^  the  road  running  throufrh  their  town- 
ship from  Osburn  to  Goderick.    Words  cannot  convey  an  ade- 
quate description  of  the  heartfelt  pleasure  exhibited  when  they 
were  informed,  at  the  close  of  the  service,  of  my  desire  and  in- 
tention (D.  V.)to  visit  them  ro&lt;,'ularly  once  every  fortniuiht  or 
three  weeks ;  and  havinjy  intimated  to  them  in  my  visit  that 
they  should  name  a  convenient  day  and  hour,  so  as  to  allow  them 
time  to  attend  to  tho  business  of  their  farms  ;  one,  who  appeared 
to  be  the  spokesman,  remarked  "  day  and  hour,  Sir,  most  con- 
venient to  yourself,  will  be  thv^  day  and  hour  most  convenient 
to  us  ;"  and  he  afterwards  added,  "  we  should  pfladly  give  our 
attendance  on  the  most  busy  days  for  five  hours."    They  appear 
to  be  a  most  respectable  class  of  farmers.    I  understand  they 
had  made  application  to  the  Canada  Company  for  a  clergyman, 
but  the  Company's  Agent  could  not  guarantee  to  them  the  ser- 
vices, unless  they  would  bind  themselves  to  promise  £100  per 
annum,  which  at  present  they  are  literally  unjible  to  do,  as  far 
as  I  can  judge  of  their  means  ;  of  course,  if  impracticable  pro- 
positions like  this  are  made,  no  one  can  say  when  the  services 
of  the  Church  will  be  open  to  them,  but  this  every  one  must  see, 
it  will  not  be  till  all  wishes  for  them  have  died  away  in  their 
hearts.    So  many  arc  tlie  wants  of  the  emigrant  at  first,  and  so 
very  dear  is  every  article,  that  quickly  all  the  little  capital  they 
bring  out  vanishes  away,  and  so  far  from  being  able  to  contri- 
bute to  the  erection  of  churches,  or  the  maintenance  of  a  minis- 
ter, they  are  unable  to  procure  even  for  themselves  many  of  the 
most  necessary  articles  belonging  to  their  condition.     It  is  to  be 
hoped,  liowever,  the  sunny  day  will  yet  shine  out,  and  when  that 
day  occurs,  I  hope  and  trust  the  toil  worn  emigrant  will  not  be 
backwar&lt;l  in  proving  his  gratitude  for  kindness  in  his  aflHieted 
state,  by  contributing  cheerfully  to  the  support  of  the  missions. 
IMll  then  you  and  others  must  be  content  to  labour,  and  what  i.i 
often  worse,  to  beg,  however  painful  and  disagreeable  the  task 
may  be,  and  tre  must  pray  unceasingly  that  the  silver  and  gold

tiiom  inalio  tho  n'S{ioMso.H  in  an  iiiidiblc  and  f(!('liii;r  manner.  Not 
moro  tiian  s«'von  miles  cllstant  from  tlnMn  then;  is  an  Irish  Hot- 
tlt^nient  with  a  i'rw  Mn^dish  families.  'l'iieseconi&gt;r&lt;&gt;j,'ati()HH,  with 
those  whi&lt;-h  comM  be  »|iiiek!y  ^'athenMl  by  a  zealous  and  devoted 
man,  would  afford  an  amph;  tiidd  for  tlie  service  of  a  resident 
minister.  In  fact,  there  is  an  extensive  sphei-e  of  lalxiur  for  three 
cler;,''ym(Mi,  or  even  four,  already  settled  in  the  townshi|»s  of  Lon- 
don, Biddidph,  .M'Crillavray,  anil  Osborn.  With  an  anxious  desin' 
to  serve  tlu'm,  (and  which  is  yet  very  iiuideipuitely  p(!rformed)  1 
may  say  1  am  ridin;;;  and  pn^aciiiu;,'  every  day,  and  if  I  set  afiart 
u  day  for  writin/,'  or  otluM*  avocations,  [  find  I  am  always  called 
away  either  to  visit  a  si&lt;'k  person,  or  to  bai)ti/e  a  child  at  Honn&gt; 
remote  corner  of  the  s(&gt;ttlemt'nt.  Tliis  very  day  1  had  arranpfud 
to  make  ^'ood  my  jn'omiso  in  April,  which  has  already  been 
dehiy(!d  too  Iomi,'',  l»ut  I  was  scarcidy  dressed  when  a  ])erson  ar- 
rived from  a  distance,  to  request  1  would  Jicc(nnpany  him  and 
baptizo  a  child  which  they  apprehended  to  be  dyin^ — so  not

nearly  miduit^ht)  to  fill  uj;  this  sheet  fearinfjf  you  may  bu  sur- 
prised, and  your  friends  disap])ointed  i&gt;y  my  delay  ;  but  should  1 
put  off  aijfain  until  I  return  from  the  appointment,  to  which  1  start 
at  seven  in  the  mornini,'',  it  is  very  jxjssible,  (indeed  more  than  pro- 
bablo,)that  a  very  Ion;,'  delay  would  be  the  result.  J  have  succeed- 
ed in  establishiujo;  a  lar&lt;^e  Sabbath  school  in  the  townshij)  of 
London.  The  attendance  is  from  00  to  100.  1  have  so  arranged 
as  alternately  to  examine  the  boys  and  girls.  I  have  adopted 
this  plan  from  having  seen  it  used  with  abundant  usefulness  in 
the  parish  of  Mr.  Carpenter,  in  the  county  of  Wicklow,  who  cate- 
chises the  children  regularly  after  service,  upon  the  divisions, 
and  matter  of  the  text,  &amp;c.  I  think  from  appearance,  that  if  fol- 
lowed up,  it  is  likely  to  be  very  useful  hero.  May  the  Lord 
grant  it  for  Christ's  sake,  and  to  liim  be  the  praise. 

I  have  again  visited  the  Indian  Settlement  at  Monsoc  Town, 
in  company  with  their  invaluable  and  eminently  pious  Mission- 
ary, Mr.  Flood.  Indeed  ho  and  his  amiable  consort  and  fellow- 
worker  in  the  Mission,  ought  not  to  bo  forgotten  by  the  Cliristian 
public  at  home — unnoticed — unpaid,  unless  so  far  as  you  and 
your  friends  have  helped  him  out  of  your  small  funds,  he  labours 
to  win  souls  to  his  Divine  master,  and  rejoices  to  bear  to  the  red 
man,  without  price,  the  glad  tidings  of  great  joy. 

I  lectured  from  part  of  John  xxi.  at  the  Mission  House. 
One  of  their  Chiefs  "  Half  Aloon"  was  present.*  I  trust  the  Lord 
has  made  blessed  Mr.  Flood's  preacdiing  in  the  saving  conversion 
of  this  poor  Pagan's  soul.  I  did  not  mean  in  this  letter  to  have 
quoted  any  thing  from  my  Journal,  but  as  circumstances  have 
prevctited  my  doing  what  I  would,  I  will  send  you  one  or  two 
extracts  which  uniy  make  the  letter  more  interesting  perhaps 
to  some  of  your  friends.    July  28th  relates  to  the  Indians,  and

I  will  transcribe  it  first : — "Visited  the  Indian  villa},'e  with  Mr. 
"  F.     Our  voad  ;iy  throuffh  a  large  forest  :    ifter  niiieli  scram bliiig 
"and  80M10  Hcrutches,  we  got  into  a  more  open  country,  and 
"shortlv  after  came  in  sight  of  the  hamlets.      'Ihc  ricli  and 
"  varied  sccnerv  of  these  villages,  situate  upon  the  Thames,  is 
"tnily  delightful.     Upon  one  side  of  th&lt;' river  the  ground  rose 
"to  a  great  elevation,  and   upon   the  other  lay  extensive  piairu-, 
"(or  flats  as  they  call  them  in  this  country ,W'ovei('&lt;l  in  uuiiiy 
"places  with  clumps  of  trees,   jjreseiiting   tlu^  app&lt;'avaiico   of 
"pleasure  ground.     Several  neat  looking  cottages,  built  by  the 
'' orders  of  Sir  John  Colborne,  the  father  »»f  the  Indian  tribes, 
"peering  amid  the  trees  at  certain  distances  along  the  height 
"above  the  river  presented  a  view  truly  picturesque.     As  many 
"  of  the  fndians  were  absent,  the  village  had  the  appearance  of 
"  hcMUg  deserted,  were  you  not  led  to  tliink  otherwise  by  the  fine 
"Ih'Ids  of  Indian  corn,  whi«'h  the  eye  met  in  luaiiy  directions  ; 
"and  that  the  stillness  of  the  s(;eno  was  ever  and  anon  broken 
"  by  the  who«)p  or  call  of  the  little  Indian  boys,  who  might  now 
"and  then  be  seen  peeping  from  behind  tlu*  bushes  at  the  white 
"men  as   they  passed.     The  worthy  Missionary,  or  in  Indian 
"parlance  '  their  man,'  seems  to  be  highly  valued  by  these  rude 
"children  of  the  forest.     Having  examined  everything  in  tiie 
"  villages,  interesting  and  novel  to  an  Kuropeaii,  we  i)nrsued  a 
"  dift'orent  route  on  our  way  back — to  visit  their  count  il  house, 
"  built  of  rough  logs  in   the  depth  of  the  Avood,  near  a  spring. 
"(Acts  xvi.  l.'i.)     Tliis  house  formerly  answered  (lie  two-fold 
"purpo.^es  of  council  house  and  t(!nii)le,  hero  they  consulted  on 
"  the  afJ'airs  of  the  tribes — and  hero  they  celebrated  their  pagan 
"  feasts.     It  is  an  oblong  building,  the  floor  earthen,  hard  and 
"&lt;^ven.     At  both  sides,  about  the  breadth  of  three  feet   was 
"  marked  off  by  long  poles,  ninning  paralltd  to  the  walls  iiiid 
"lying  along  the  floor,  these  were  filletl  with  fern  and  on  thcii 
"  they  sit  or  lie.     I  saw  many  sticks  of  hard  wood,  broad  at  the 
"  ends  and  carved  with  many  devices,  with  those  they  were 
"accustomed  to  beat  a  bear  skin  wlien  any  Indian  spoke  during 
"  a  sacrifice.    Although  all  are  not  yet  turned  from  th(»  i)()wer  of 
"  Satan  to  the  service  of  the  true  God  ;  and  although  it  is  to  be 
"  regretted  that  many  still  sit  in  pagan  darkness,  yet  as  some  of 
"  their  most  influential  chiefs  have  embraced  Christianity,  and 
"  not  only  80,  but  are  ai)parently  become  sa\ingly  devoted  to  the 
"  Lord,  Mr.  F.  has  reason  to  believe  that  no  jiagan  sacrifices  are 
"  now  made,  and  that  virtually  the  words  of  the  Trophet  msiy  be 
"applied  to  them  ;  'their  Idols  they  have  cast  to  tlie  moles  and 
"  to  the  bats.' "     Amid  my  numerous  interruptions  I  had  gotten 
thus  far  when  I  received  your  letter  of  June  6th,  and  I  have  al 
ready  said  enough  to  satisfy  your  friends  that  though  for  a  time 
apparently  withdrawn  to  a  certain  extent  from  my  Mission,  in 
order  to  fill  up  the  gap  occasioned  by  the  absence  of  Air.  C.  yet 
I  have  not  been  inattentive  to  their  principal  cause  of  anxiety,

\\\fr  over  dooi)  nnid-holes  day  after  dny  is  trying-  to  the  best  of 
liorsoH— I  might  add  to  the  best  constitution — by  the  Divine 
Idessiu'jf  T  hope  I  shall  be  found  fiiithful  to  the  appointment 
with  wiiieh  tlie  dear  IJishop  honoured  me.  Tliere  is  one  part  of 
your  -otter  which  I  must  not  omit  to  answer,  viz.  :  your  inqiiirv 
as  to  means — it  is  a  subject  which  I  should  not  Imve  touched  if 
you  liad  not  so  kindly  pressed  it,  and  I  feel  dee})ly  grateful  for 
tlie  consideration  of  my  comfort,  wliidi  the  enquiry  shews — as 
you  have  asked  mo  to  give  you  my  candid  opinion.  I  scarcely 
need  tell  vou,  that  the  service  in  whicli  I  am  engaged,  on  my 
present  alloAvance,  does  require  the  strictest  economy — every 
])art  of  dress  and  every  necessary  article  is  so  extremely  expensive 
here, — and  the  wear  and  tear  you  will  readily  believe  of  such  a 
service  must  be  gi'eat.  Do  not  however  suppose  from  my  giving 
you  this  information,  that  I  have  any  doubts  or  any  feelings  of 
distrust  or  discontent — I  have  none — and  it  was  only  your  own 
particular  request  which  could  have  elicited  a  remark  from  me 
upon  the  subject.  Of  coui-se  the  loss  of  the  dear  Bishop  of 
Quebec's  fostering  care  of  his  own  pp.rticular  Mission  must  be  a 
loss  to  me,  but  I  have  every  confidence  in  the  Bishop  of  IVIontreal 
and  the  Socictv  at  Toronto,  that  they  will  facilitate  your  plans 
of  making  his  intentions  good.  As  I  find  one  horse  will  not  be 
able  to  do  the  work,  I  will  endeavour  to  keep  a  second  during 
the  remainder  of  the  term- — unfortunately,  however,  it  is  not 
only  the  horse  which  fails — being  daily  so  much  on  horseback  I 
fiiul  my  back  fails  too  ;  and  I  have  been  strongly  recommended 
to  ado]it  a  light  carriage  where  the  roads  are  practicable — and 
tiien  take  to  the  saddle  when  they  begin  to  be  bad.  I  shall  send 
over  my  journal,  perhaps  those  of  both  years,  to  Liverpool,  in 
September,  to  be  forwarded  to  you,  for  the  information  of  your 
friends — should  you  think  the  whole  or  any  part  will  answer 
your  purpose  of  circulation,  and  raise  up  friends  for  this  destitute 
province.  Subject  to  the  usual  chances  and  delays,  I  will  write 
again  as  soon  as  I  have  matter  to  communicate,  and  remain,  &amp;c.

St^venih  Letter  from  the  Rev.  Thomas  Green,  Stewart  TrarelUng  Mis- 

sioiiary,  London  District. 

London,  Upper  Canada,  November  2^rdy  183"] . 
Dear  Sm, — I  hope  ere  this  you  have  received  my  journal ; 
I  had  not  an  opportunity  of  transmitting  it  as  early  as  I  had  an- 
ticipated. I  think  if  the  perusal  be  not  productive  of  any  other 
interest,  it  cannot  but  impi-ess  the  mind  of  the  reader  with  the 
nature  and  extent  of  our  destitution.  I  was  very  desirous  to 
have  written  at  the  same  time,  by  the  friend  who  undertook  to 
send  you  the  parcel  from  Liverpool,  but  I  could  not  accomplish 
it,  indeed  I  could  scarcely  find  time  to  finish  transcribing  the 
journal.  To  prevent  any  inconvenience  to  you  by  the  publica- 
tion of  that  of  the  second  year  of  my  mission,  I  wrote,  in  Sep- 
tember, to  the  Secretary  at  Tor(.T\'  o,  to  ascertain  the  precise

The  intelligence  of  the  death  of  our  beloved  and  iiivaltuible 
ilishop,  Dr.  SteA\art,  was  received  here  with  the  deepest  regrcL 
by  all  denominations  of  christians,  amongst  whom  he  laboured  ; 
for  all  were  convinced  of  his  untiring  zeal  and  devotidii  to  the 
cause  of  the  gospel.  The  many  now  in  the  llesli,  wiio  heard 
from  his  lips  "the  Truth  as  it  is  in  Jesus,"  when  truvelUng  mis- 
sionary in  our  immense  Diocese,  speak  of  him  with  the  greutest 
affection.  I  am  sure  the  delight  he  took  in  doing  acts  of  kind- 
ness to  all,  and  esj)ecially  to  his  Clergy,  will  not  rejvlily  pass 
aAvay  from  the  recollection  of  the  survivor-:,  ^lay  the  Lord  till 
our  hearts  with  the  missionary  spirit  which  aninuited  our  dear 
iJishop,  and  grant  us  as  strong  a  desii'e  to  win  souls  us  pervaded 
Jiis  mind,  that  our  rest  like  his  nuiy  bo  "glorious,"  and  that  the 
voice  which  now  speaketh  to  us  from  his  tomb,  may  s^p.'alc  from 
our  graves,  to  those  who  succeed  us  in  this  work  oT  christian  love. 

Since  my  last  letter  of  August  ^rd,  1  have  visited  the  town- 
ship of  I^issouri,  wiiich  is  yet  hut  thinly  inliabited — it  is,  how- 


ever, fast  filling  uj),  as  the  land  is  considered 


good. 


Havinjr 


preached  seveial  times  near  the  Town  Line,  on  one  occasion  I 
was  called  upon  to  visit  a  sick  wonuin  in  thac  totvnship,  and 
hearing  there  were  a  few  persons  very  anxious  I  -hould,  at  the 
same  time,  hold  Church  service  and  preach  ;  1  named  as  early  a 
day  as  other  previoiis  appointments i)ermitted  ;  and  findint^',  upon 
empiiry,  that  the  case  Avas  not  one  of  innnediate  danger,  [  jxist- 
poned  my  visit  two  da}  s,  to  give  time  i'ox  circulating-  the  nutic*^'. 
On  the  day  a])pointed,  my  horse  having  strayed  away  in  tiui 
woods  the  preceding  ev(&gt;ning,  I  set  off  on  foot,  with  sonii;  hope 
of  borrowing  one  upon  tlie  rocd  ;  on  my  way  i  visited  a  family 
from  England,  with  whom  I  held  some  very  interesting,  and  [ 
trust,  profitable  conversation  about  "  the  Truth."  While  speak- 
ing of  the  love  of  our  Saviour,  in  leaving  the  glory  whicli  he  had 
before  the  world  was,  and  becoming  himself  incarnate  in  the 
flesh  for  our  redemption,  the  father  seemed  to  be  most  dee])!y 
affected,  and  the  tears  chased  each  other  down  his  aged  clieeks. 
As  soon  as  they  heard  of  my  intended  visit,  they  willingly  offered 
me  the  loan  of  one  of  their  horses.  I  was  obliged  to  cross  a 
broad  and  rajjid  river,  at  the  time  considerably  swollen  by  the 
late  heavy  falls  of  rain  :  having  succeeded  in  crossing,  I  journied 
on,  as  fast  as  the  wretched  state  of  the  roads  would  permit,  to  be 
in  time  to  keep  my  appointment,  and  to  be  enabled  to  return 
before  the  thick  shade  of  niglit  set  in.  I  found  no  little  difficulty 
in  keeping  my  road,  as  in  many  places  I  could  not  well  distin- 
guish it  from  other  parts  of  the  wood,  as  it  was  not  what  we 
call  "cJiopfed  out.^^  When  within  about  half-a-mile  of  the  house, 
I  was  recognized  by  a  member  of  the  Church,  who  had  heard  me 
preach  in  the  township  of  London  ;  he  cheerfully  consented  to 
become  my  guide  for  the  remainder  of  the  way.  Arriving  at  the 
house  of  the  invalid,  I  found  a  few  persons  assembled  to  attend 
prayers.  The  sick  woman  was  confined  to  'ler  bed,  humble  in- 
deed but  clean,  apparently  dying  in  the  last  stage  of  a  con- 
sumption. She  appeared  to  be  much  gratified  by  my  visit.  I 
read  to  her  such  portions  of  scripture  as  I  thought  best  suited  to

one  sufForing,  and  sinking  into  the  silent  grave  ;  having  read  and 
conversed  with  her  as  long  as  the  enfeebled  state  of  her  health 
allowed,  all  present  knelt  down  and  joined  ine  in  commending 
her  to  the  God  of  all  grace,  and  the  father  of  mercy  !  It  was 
truly  a  solemn  time,  the  poor  woman  seemed  to  realize  the  im- 
mecliate  approach  of  eternity,  the  friends  and  relatives,  tlie 
closing  scene  of  her  suffering  life.  Tlie  comfortless  dwelling  (a 
wretched  log-house)  in  the  midst  of  a  deep  wood,  now  stripped 
of  all  its  beautiful  foliage  and  looking  cheerless — the  stillness 
which  reigned  around,  all  combined  to  awaken  feelings  of  lone- 
liness ;  but  the  comfort  of  knowing  our  Father  in  Christ  in  the 
wild  wilderness  of  wood,  is  the  same  as  in  the  beautiful,  happy, 
and  well  cultivated  plains  of  happy  England  ; — and  the  assu- 
rance that  Ilis  ear  is  as  ready  to  hear,  and  His  hand  to  heal  and 
to  save  here,  as  in  the  land  of  our  birth,  enabled  us  to  put  "  a 
cheerful  courage  on."  After  prayer  I  commenced  the  evening 
service  of  the  Church.  The  sentences,  the  exhortation,  and  con- 
fession came  home  to  my  own  heart  with  increased  unction,  and 
I  hope  also  to  the  hearts  of  my  hearers.  I  stood  before  them 
the  first  Church  Minister  that  ever  held  a  public  service  in  the 
township ;  (this  has  been  tiie  case  with  other  townships  also) 
and  it  is  highly  probable  the  only  service  in  which  some  of  them 
had  joined  since  they  sailed  for  this  country.  At  the  close  of 
the  service, a  Mr.  Bowers,  an  Irish  emigrant,  observed,  "we  are 
but  poor  Church  people.  Sir,  but  we  have  no  opportunity  offered 
to  us,  of  now  enjoying  the  ministrations  of  our  Church."  They 
then  re(iuested  me  to  leave  an  appointment,  which  I  did, 
althougli  a])prehensive  from  the  bad  state  of  the  roads,  (ren- 
dered worse  by  the  recent  heavy  falls  of  rain,)  I  should  expe- 
rience great  difficulty  in  attending ;  I  also  promised,  if  spared,  as 
soon  as  the  sleighing  season  commenced,  or  the  roads  wen; 
frozen,  that  I  would  visit  them  regularly,  so  long  as  I  remained 
in  the  neighbourhood.  This  promise  seemed  to  give  them  much 
pleasure,  and  they  expressed  the  greatest  thankfulness.  A 
fortnight  after,  I  made  the  attempt  to  visit  them,  but  owing  to 
the  state  of  the  roads,  the  horse  sinking  to  the  knees  at  every 
step,  I  failed  in  holding  service,  it  was  so  late  before  I  could 
reach  them.  As  the  travelling  had  become  so  very  tedious  and 
laborious,  I  deferred  making  another  appointment  for  some 
time  ;  but  promised  (D.  V.)  to  see  them  often  in  sleighing  time, 
which  seemed  to  give  them  increased  pleasure.  On  this  occa- 
sion one  of  the  congregation  accompanied  me  some  miles,  to 
guide  me  through  the  woods  ;  he  spoke  much  of  the  privileges 
and  opjjortunities  enjoyed  at  home ;  and  speaking  of  the  advan- 
tages enjoyed  under  the  mild  rule  of  the  British  Crown,  he  re- 
marked, "  I  have  liberty  enough — all  the  liberty  I  now  desire,  is 
the  liberty  of  having  a  Church  and  Sabbath  schools,  as  at  home  ; 
and  not  to  be  left  to  ourselves  as  we  now  are.  Pray,  Sir,  try 
and  come  to  iis  as  often  as  you  can  ?"  The  remarks  I  heard,  in 
the  course  of  this  ride,  as  in  many  others,  prove  to  me,  that  the 
emigrant  does  not  lose  hi .  home  feelings,  nor  forget  his  home 
associations  in  the  midst  of  his  labours  and  difficulties  here  ;  but 
on  the  contrary,  for  a  considerable  time,  his  heart  throbs  warmly 
towards  them,  till  hope  delayed  makes  the  heart  sick.    Oh,  Sir,

msin  of  the  name  of  llotlgiiis,  a  short  time  Jigo,  who  had  rid&lt;!en 
thirteen  miles  to  recjuest  mo  to  attend  a  funeral,  I  was  niueli 
struck  wicli  the  appeurancu  of  the  e(nintry,  and  casually  re- 
marked, liow  b&lt;.'autifiil  this  country  could  b(!  m-ide,  if  persons

would  be  made  much  more  beautiful  if  wo  could  see  Cliurclies

my  subsequent  conversation  with  hiui,  that  this  speech  was  not 
uttei-ed  with  any  view  to  please  or  compliment  me,  but  incideu- 
tally  broke  out  as  the  kuiguage  of  truth,  and  the  strong  feeling 
of  his  heart.  Upon  another  occasion,  some  females  of  the  name 
ofiSmitli,  from  England,  speaking  of  the  hope  entertained  by 
some  of  their  friends  of  j)rocuring  a  small  bell  for  a  C'uirch  in 
ttieir  neighbourhood,  adaed  with  great  animation,  "  that  would 
iudeed  sound  like  Sunday  once  again." 

Tlio  accounts  of  our  destitution  transmitted  occasionally, 
may  indeovl  carry  some  idea  of  our  spiritual  waiits,  but  they 
cannot  carry  any  thing  a})proaching  to  the  i)ainful  reality  ;  to 
.'^certain  them  in  any  thing  bordeiing  upon  the  degi"''e  in  which 
they  really  cxiat,  it  is  necessary  to  travel  from  townsliij)  to  town- 
ship— from  settlement  to  settlement — from  house  to  lu)nse. 
J)uring  the  summer  months,  I  was  most  successful  in  e:-tabli:h- 
ing  the  Sunday  school  I  mentioned,  in  the  very  centre  of  the 
township  of  London.  Tiie  average  attendance  was  about  ninety. 
Some  Sabbaths  we  mustered  very  strong  ;  tlio  greatest  possible 
interest  appeared  to  prevail,  not  only  amongst  the  diildren,  but 
amongst  the  parents  and  teachers.  One  of  the  latter  used 
fi'e&lt;[uently  to  visit  me,  late  on  Saturday  night,  walking  more 


S, 


crip- 


tliau  a  mile,  that  he  might  be  pre})ared  in  the  ])ortion  of 
ture  to  be  read  in  his  class  the  following  morning.  The  hours 
of  attendance  was  from  one  to  half-past  three  ;  as  I  had  to  ride 
neai'  seven  miles  after  iry  first  service,  I  was  seldom  able  to  be 
}&gt;resent  before  three,  but  then  I  examined  for  half-aniu)ur,&gt;  or 
more  when  J  could,  taking  each  class  in  succession.  We  closed 
by  singing  a  psalm  and  prayer  ;  after  which  the  evening  service 
commenced.  It  was  truly  cheering  to  see  so  many  attending 
service,  sometimes,  I  believe,  al.ove  three  hundi-ed.  A  few 
weeks  past  I  held  a  public  examination  ;  and  after  a  careful 
examination  of  nearly  three  hours,  was  much  pleasi'd  with  the 
gi-nerul  answering.  I  think  about  nine  or  ten  chapters  of  Luke's 
(ilosi)el  were  committed  to  memory  by  the  upper  classes,  and  in 
pro))Ovtion  by  the  junior.  Tlie  Secretary  informed  me  afterwards 
that  the  aggregate  number  of  verses,  thus  impressed  on  so  many 
youthful  minds,  amomited  to  several  thousands — the  precise 
number  I  forget.  May  the  Lord  of  the  vineyard  water  the 
seed.  I  awarded  upwards  of  twenty  premiums,  supplied  &lt;mt  of 
the  funds,  which  you  and  your  friends  entrusted  to  me  ;  the 
premiums  consisted  of  Prayer  Books,  Bibles,  Testaments,  and 
a  few  other  interesting  and  useful  books.  The  accounts  of  the 
other  Sunday  schools  established  in  other  parts  of  my  Mission  at

are  ccjiially  satisfactory — "  I  know,"  he  writes  lately  to  iiie, "  you 
'*  will  be  ^lad  to  hear  that  since  your  last  visit  to  Vienna  (I  was 
"  there  the  day  the  school  opened,  as  mentioned  in  a  former 
"  letter,)   we   have   fully  established  the  Sunday  school,  and, 
"  from  the  present  aspect,  it  promises  well.     I  have  endeavoured, 
"  and  in  great  measure  succeeded,  in  raising  a  better  interest  in 
"  its  favour  than  formerly  existed.     Forty  children  at  jjresent 
"  attend,  and  I  have  hopes  of  many  more."    The  scliool,  also, 
at  Port  Jiui'well,  api)ears  to  go  on  prosperously  ;  many  adults 
attend    there,  and  all  join  in   reading  the  scriptures.      God 
grant  in  these  our  small  things,  many  may  be  enabled,  by  the 
Holy  Spirit's  teaching,  to  draw  water  henceforward  from  the 
wells  of  salvation.    Colonel  Burwell  has  got  the  Church  at  the 
Port  plastered.    He  has  also  set  apart  a  neat  and  comfortable 
house  for  the  residence  of  a  minister,  and   has  endowed  the 
Church,  from  his  own  property,  very  liberally  with  lands  ;  but 
for  the  present  they  are  useless ;  an  i  unless  some  other  provi- 
sion can  be  made  for  the  maintenrxnce  of  a  clergyman,  these 
places  will  not  soon  enjoy  the  ministration  of  a  resident  clergy- 
man. 

In  my  last  visit  to  the  distant  parts  of  my  mission  (at  one 
of  the  stations  on  the  Talbot-street,)  at  the  close  of  service, 
eight  children  were  presented  for  baptism.  I  felt  particularly 
pleased  on  this  occasion.  The  inhabitants  of  the  place  are  at- 
tached to  the  Baptists,  in  a  large  proportion^ — many  of  whom 
were  present  during  the  baptismal  service.  Deeming  it  .advis- 
able and  useful  to  lecture  on  the  nature  and  design  of  this 
sacrament,  I  endeavoured,  in  the  course  of  my  remarks,  to  re- 
move the  objections  which  are  so  frequently  made  to  this  rite. 
I  was  listened  to  with  the  deepest  attention.  In  the  evening, 
the  father  of  six  of  the  children  whom  I  had  baptized  in  the 
morning,  called  upon  me  and  said  to  me,  '"Sir,  there  is  a  load 
now  removed  from  my  mind  which  has  long  grieved  and  per- 
plexed it."  It  appears  that,  from  my  early  visits  to  the  place, 
he  was  convinced  of  the  necessity  of  havin«g  his  little  ones  baj)- 
tized ;  but,  as  his  wife  made  objections,  he  did  not  press  the 
matter,  but,  at  every  visit  to  their  house,  introduced  the  subject 
in  her  presence,  end  used  to  request  me  to  assign  my  reasons 
for  the  adoption  of  infant  Baptism,  which  thus  ultimately  ter- 
minated in  bringing  them  to  one  mind.*  The  labours  of  a  travel- 
ling missionary  .are  very  liarassing,  he  is  obliged  to  undergo  so 
many  privations,  and  expose  himself  to  every  kind  of  weather, 
frequently  in  danger  of  missing  the  road,  and  losing  himself  in 
these  dense  woods,  a  circumstance  very  far  from  agreeable, 
should  it  happen  at  the  approach  of  night.  I  have  often  lost  the 
track  in  the  day  ;  and,  upon  one  occasion,  almost  despaired  of 
making  my  way  to  some  clearance.  Twice,  since  my  last  letter, 
I  have  lost  the  path  at  night.  On  the  last  occasion,  in  the  morn- 
ing of  October  23rd,  I  was  obliged  to  ride  ten  miles.  Owing  to 
the  bad  state  of  the  roads,  the  journey  was  a  most  tedious  one  ; 
and  as  I  had  made  an  appointment  for  the  evening,  also  ten 
miles  in  the  opposite  direction,  I  rode  as  fast  as  the  poor  horse 
could  travel,  without  injury  to  him.  Two  children  were  pre-

in  view,  npon  this  occasion,  in  bruKjinij  their  child nn  a  dhtancf  of 
nearly  tliirty  mlleit,  was,  that  their  deai*  little  ones  migiit  be  ad-

Kzekiol,  xxxvi.  25,  and  Acts,  viii.  HO,  '.iT.    After  the  baptism, 
I  sot  off  for  the   residence  of  a   kind    and   truly    lios])itable 
friend,   about    four   miles    distant.     I  had   not    ridden    nearly 
half  of  the  distance,  when  the  ni&lt;^ht  became  so  very  dark  that 
my  liorso  missed   the  track.      A  licavy  storm  of  wind   and 
rain  i)revailed  at  the  same  time,  and  rendered   my  situation 
dreary  and  uncomfortable  enoufjh.     After  many  fruitless  efforts 
to  disentangle  myself,  I   found  it  ho})eless  to  make  any  way 
through  the  wootfs,  I  made  up  my  mind  to  the  alternative — 
remaining  where  I  was,  till  morning's  light  came  to  rescue  me. 
Having,  therefore,  tied   my  horse  to  the  branch  of  a  tree,  1 
availed   myself  of  the  slielter  of  a  hollow  butter-fruit    t?"ee. 
sufficiently  large  to  receive  me,  by  sitting  erect,  and  to  shelter 
me  from  the  rain  and  wiiid.     I  trust,  though  my  situation  was 
anything  rather  than  comfortable,  that  J  was  duly  thankful  for 
the  blessing  of  shelter,  and  resigned  to  my  lot.    The  scene  was 
dreary  in  the  extreme,  from  the  thick  darkness  of  the  night,  the 
low  moaning  of  the  wind  among  the  Av«jods,  which  frequently 
swelled  into  loud  gusts,  anr'  the  rattling  of  the  rain  upon  the 
leaves,  which  were  everywh(;re    thickly   scattere'l    upon   the 
ground.     In  this  situation,  though  cheerless,  I  was  not  comfort- 
less ;  and  I  felt  my  soid  ascend  in  a  spirit  of  prayer  to  the 
throne  of  grace.    As  soon  as  the  storm  abated,  and  the  light 
began  to  appear,  I  thought  it  best  to  endeavour  to  make  my 
way  to  my  friend,  who  could  not  be  above  two  miles  oft^  and 
1  made  to  the  banks  of  the  river  Thames,  which  I  heard  roaring 
at  a  short  distance,  and  which  flows  close  to  his  residence.     1 
knew,  therefore,  that  by  following  the  course  of  the  stream,  I 
might  succeed  in  making  my  way.      Leaving,  therefore,  my 
horse,  for  I  was  conscious  I  should  find  more  difficulty  with 
iiim,  by  reason  of  fallen  trees,  and  through  the  bnish,  with  so 
little  more  than  "darkness  visible,"  I  commenced  again  my  ramble 
on  foot,  and  a  weary  one  it  was.    After  three  hours'  hard  scram- 
bling, with  falls,  and  rolls,  and  scratches  without  number,  I 
found  myself  under  the  roof  of  my  hospitable  friend.    I  give 
you  these  details,  not  for  the  vain  purpose  of  enhancing  my  own 
services,  but  for  your  friends,  and  any  missionaries  you  send,  to 
make  an  easier  judgment  as  to  the  service  the  messenger  of 
Chi'ist  must  go  thiough  here.     I  am  very  thankful  to  say,  on 
my  own  part,  that  neither    on  this  or  any  other  occasion  of 
danger  or  toil,  did  I  experience  any  unpleasant  effects,  farther 
than  the  immediate  inconvenience  and  the  temporary  anxiety 
such  circumstances  unavoidably  produce. 

The  total  number  of  baptisms  since  I  commenced  my 
Mission,  amoimts  now  to  more  than  180,  and.  I  ex])ect  Avill  far 
exceed  200  before  you  receive  this  letter — as  I  have  received 
several  notices  for  baptism.s.  This  number  may  ai)pear  small, 
when  you  consider  the  tract  of  country  over  which  it  extends  ;

hy  tlio  casual  visits  of  Uissentin^'  Ministei's.  TIn'f;  is  one  of  the 
inevitable  eonserjutuu-es  of  t!ie  (jxi.sting  destitution.  J)e&gt;|)airinu 
of  the  rites  of  the  Ciiuirh,  they  are,  if  piou:sIy  inclined,  too 
happy  to  obtain  wuch  as  present  themselves.  In  one  or  two 
instances,  the  parents  hav  wislnnl  me  to  re-bapti/.e  their 
children  ;  Avhicli,  of  course,  1  (Uudined  to  do.  I  ho])e  sot)n  to  be

of  children  to  be  presented  for  ba]»tisni.  As  far  as  I  can  judf^e 
from  my  own  observation,  there  is  an  ample  field  for  the  most 
active  services  of  six  faithful  and  zctloiis  Mhilxkrs  in  wi/ district 
aldUii.  May  the  Lord  soon  gi-ant  a  fit  provision  to  be  made  for 
tiie  suitable  lUidntenance  of  the  few  Clerfjfy  we  iuive  ;  and  may 
he  put  it  into  the  hearts  of  Christians  on  your  side  of  the  &lt;;Teat 
water,  to  send,  and  that  quickly,  many  more  faithful  standard- 
b(!arers  of  the  Cross,  to  helj)  lis  in  this  labour  of  love.  I  beiifin 
to  think  now,  after  having-  tocn  so  mucli  of  my  district,  that  the 
Episcopalians,  thouf^li  .'generally  reported  in  this  country  and  at 
home  OS  the  least,  are  by  far  the  'luoat  vumcroui^  denomination  of 
Christians  here.  The  plan  now  in  contemplation  of  an  additional 
roll  in  the  next  assessment,  in  order  that  tlie  relii;ious  per- 
suasions of  the  in'.iabitants  may  be  inserted  therein,  will  soon 
set  the  question  at  I'est,  and  I  believe  Avill  confirm  the  opinion 
I  have  formed.  1  am  glad  to  tell  you,  and  I  do  it  with  much 
p-atitude  to  yonrFolf  and  friends,  that  your  kind  eudeavours 
have  l»een  successful,  and  that  my  pecuniary  difticulties  and 
em]»arrassments,  jconsequent  upon  the  illness  and  death  of  our 
beloved  Bislioj),  are  over.  I  have  been  jiaid,  up  to  An^j:st, 
mj^  salary  in  currency.  INIy  expences  from  New  Yoi'k  to 
Qne]&gt;ec,  about  wliich  yon  inquire,  were  ei;;hteeii  dollars,  or  £4  in 
sterlinu^. 

I  am  not  at  present  pre])ared  to  say  whether  circumstances 
will  allow  me  to  acce})t  a  continuance  of  my  Travelling-  Mi;  hion, 
longer  than  the  period  at  first  agreed  upon,  even  sliould  my 
health  bo  si&gt;ared,  and  yon  and  your  friends  felt  disjioFed  to 
continue  it.  I  ne(Kl  Jiot  tell  you,  who  knew  the  i'ishop's  life  so 
well,  and  have  had  my  fii-st  year's  Journal  to  jieruse,  how  trying 
a  service  to  tiie  con^jtitution  an  active  missionary  life  must  be. 
You  know  what  he  was — yon  know  what  he  did — and  yo\i  have 
before  your  eyes  the  melancholy  i-csult :  incessant  labour- 
prematurely  aged,  and  worn  out  i'l  body  and  mind,  sinking 
into  the  grave.  Of  this,  however,  be  well  assured,  for  the 
remainder  of  my  time,  I  hope  by  God's  grace,  to  be  found  as 
zealous  and  as  faithful  in  the  charge  to  which  y  u  and  your 
friends  were  the  means  of  raising  me,  as  heretofore  ;  and  what- 
ever my  future  lot  may  be,  or  wherever  it  may  be  cast,  your 
kindnesses  will  never  be  forgotten  :  and  I  shall  feel  happy  if  1 
may  be  considered  "The  Stewart  Missionary"  still.

Extract  of  a  Letter  from  the  Ret.  R.  Flood,  Missionary  at  Cara/ioc, 
ijiniuj  an  interestititj  descrijition  of  the  Indian  chhf,  *^  Half  Moon" 
mentioned  in  Mr.  (jireeu''s  slrth  letter. 

Caradoc,  Dec.  21th,  1837. 

*  *  *  *  It  is  only  in  the  case  of  a  poor  Pagan  led  to 
the  knowledge  of  the  truth  as  it  is  in  Christ,  that  we  can  plainly 
and  literally  see,  what  the  Ajjostles  describe — "  a  soul  brought 
out  of  darkness  into  God's  marvellous  light — and  turned  from 
the  jjower  of  Satan  unto  the  living  God." 

As  their  ways  and  habits  are  so  dissimilar  to  civilized  life — 
their  Waubenois  (like  Bacchanalian  feasts)  so  strictly  observed 
at  certain  seasons  of  the  year,  with  various  ceremonies  attending 
them — which  ceremonies  are  numerous  and  ridiculous,  but  are 
yet  hallowed  to  them  as  being  the  ways  and  customs  of  their 
lorefathers,  whose  memories  they  venerate  to  an  extraordinary 
degree — from  such  deep  rooted  systems  of  delusion,  nothing  short 
of  the  love  of  Jesus,  brought  home  to  the  soul  by  the  influence 
of  the  Holy  Spirit,  can,  I  am  persuaded,  ever  sever  them,  or  em- 
power them  to  condemn  all  those  "  fond  imaginations"  and  to 
walk  henceforth  in  newness  and  holiness  of  life. 

There  is  one  man  in  particular,  of  the  Monsec  tribe,  called 
Half-moon,  than  whom  I  know  not  another  who  adorns  the 
doctrine  of  God  our  Saviour  more  consistently  and  devotedly — 
he  paid  us  a  visit  a  short  time  ago,  though  not  an  empty  one,  for 
the  grateful  creature  brought  iijjon  his  back  a  basket  of  huckle- 
berries, as  a  present  for  me.  I  was  not  only  glad  to  see  him,  but 
to  have  the  opportunity  of  giving  him  some  bread  and  meat  in 
return.    He  commenced  first  to  address  me,  oiFering  up  a  fervent 

})rayer  for  his  father  (i.  e.  myself) — then  for  my  wife.    After  this 
16  took  our  little  boy  in  his  arms,  and  called  upon  the  Holy  One 
for  a  lasting  blessing  on  his  head.    "Whenever  this  interesting

it  l)iit  a  pieco  of  dry  hroaJ,  ho  uovor  tloos  so  without^jfivinnf  thanks 
to  "  tho  author  ana  giver  of  every  jjood  and  J)erfeet  ,t,'ift,"  before 
and  after  meat,  in  his  own  tongue.  I  have  never  known  him  to 
&lt;lrink  sjjirits  of  any  kind,  lie  's,  without  any  exception,  the 
meekest  being  I  ever  Haw  ;  he  is  most  industrious  in  hisowji  litth; 
spot  of  ground;  iiis  knowledge  of  English  is  confined  to  but  few 
words. 

Our  Indian  scliool  continues  tonuikohead  way,  although  the 
children  are  vavy  irregular  in  their  attendance,  owing  to  tlu^ 
general  custom  of  their  aceompanyiiig  tiieir  parents  on  hunting 
excursions.  I  have  lately  distributcul  prayer  books  to  as  many 
of  tlio  boys  as  had  committed  the  Church  catecliism  to  memory, 
for  whicli  they  have  made  themselves  neat  covers  to  prevent 
their  being  soiled,  having  them  constantly  thrust  into  their 
bosoms,  Iteneath  their  blanket  jackets,  for  tho  sake  of  security. 
It  is  truly  delightful  to  see  these  little  one.^  following  mo  as  I  am 
reading  the  Cimrcli  service  on  the  Sabbath — with  their  books  in 
tlK'ir  hands  and  joining  with  nyj  in  singing  tho  p)=alms  and  hymns 
. — and  more  particularly  so,  as  it  is  not  nu)re  thau  two  years  since 
the  ali»lial)et  was  put  into  their  hands  fi^r  the  first  time.  When 
1  witnef-sHuch  instances  of  ra[)id  improvement  as  these,  lam 
encouraged  to  go  on,  recognizing  the  linger  of  God  in  his  own 
v/ork — to  him  be  the  honour  and  glory  fo^'  ever  and  ever. 

Thus  have  I  learned  this  lesson  experimentally  from  my  iii- 
torconrse  with  these  tribes,  that  the  only  effectual  way  to  civ'iUzr. 
the  wild  Indian,  infird  to  rhrisilanlze  him,  by  inijiressing  upon  his 
mind,  and  tho  earlier  in  life  the  better,  the  great  and  fundamental 
doctrines  of  true  religion — and  the  need  we  all  have  of  the 
sanctitying  iniluence  of  the  Holy  Spirit  to  preserve  us  unto  life 
et(irnal. 

Many  among  my  Chippewa  tribe  know  this  lesson,  and  repeat 
it  in  their  own  tongue — "Eneuch  taliezhah  ishpenning,ahyahnzig 
menoo  bemadizewin,  ahyahnzig  kcciietwahirezewin,  ahyahnzig 
ogemahwewin,  ahyahnzig  Kekenooahnuihdewin,  ahyahwahsig 
wejekewagun  ;  Kah  dushwccn  tahezhahsee  ewhety  ishpenning, 
ahyahwahsig  Christ."  A  man  may  go  to  heaven  without  jiealtii, 
without  wealth,  without  honour,  without  learning,  witliout 
friends  ;  but  he  can  never  go  to  he.aven  without  Christ. 

Our  Indians  have  been  mercifully  spared,  amidst  t!ie  late 
revolutionary  movoments,  excited  by  the  vile  agitators  in  this 
province,  from  being  called  out  by  the  Lieutenant  Governor  to 
aid  the  loyalists — as  under  thesecircumstances,  they  would  have 
been  entirely  thrown  back — and  would  probably  have  resorteil 
to  all  those  horrid  barbarities  of  scalping  and  burning  which 
they  practised,  (mild  as  they  are,)  in  the  revolutionary  war  of 
old,  when  fighting  against  the  enemies  of  Great  Britain.  This 
rebellion,  in  our  Iiitherto  peaceful  land,  lasted  but  one  week. 
Mackenzie's  party  were  not  confined  to  Toronto.  In  this  district 
(the  London)  were  many  individuals  acting  in  concert  with  him, 
but  this  vile  consjiiracy,  so  Providence  mercifully  ordered  it, 
was  ill  limed  by  them,  as  here  the  disaffected  were  only  prepar- 
ing to  take  up  arms,  wlien  their  leaders  were  rented  ard  hunted 
in  all  directions  by  the  loyal  portion  of  the  inhabitants  who  have

as  well  in  nuniliiT  as  in  courn^'O.  AVe  have  \k-ou  in  the  midst  of

serviii/,'  us  from  tl»e  ra;i;o  of  tlie  wieked.  So  true  is  it,  that  when 
the  (Uieinies  of  CJIirist  set  in  like  u  tiood,  the  Lord  lifts  uj&gt;  his 
standard  against  them.  We  have  not  a  sinijle  soldier  in  the 
ju'ovince,  the  few  reij;iments  there  wore  havinj,'  i)rf)eeeded  to

deer  and  other  Avild  beasts  pass  in  p;reatcr  numbers,  and  there  they 
erect  tlieir  wiffwams  in  small  parties,  and  continue  so  hmg  as  the

JANUARY. 

Sunday  31st,  183G.  Having  left  the  kind  and  hospitable  man- 
sion of  the  Bishop,  I  reached  Montreal  and  preached  there  in  the 
evening  to  a  very  hirge  congregation  ;  not  less  than  400  persons 
being  present,  from  whom  1  received  a  most  cordial  and  affec- 
tionate greeting. 

FEBRUARY. 

Sunday  7th-  I  preached  at  Bath,  (still  on  my  journey,)  my 
congregation  was  not  large  for  niy  visit  Avas  wholly  unexpected. 
On  every  side  the  greatest  possible  pleasure  apparently  exists 
from  the  consideration  of  an  additional  labourer  being  sent  into 
the  extensive  vineyard  which  presents  itself  in  this  country,  and 
truly  thankful  they  express  themselves  for  the  kind  endeavours 
of  tlieir  Transatlantic  brethren  to  ameliorate  their  spiritual 
destitution. 

Saturday  13th.  I  arrived  at  Simcoethe  centre  of  my  mission, 
and  was  most  cordially  received  in  the  neighbourhood.  The 
Rev.  F.  Evans,  Rector  of  Woodhouse,  requested  me  in  tlie 
kindest  manner  even  to  make  his  house  my  home  when  my 
rambles  led  me  near,  and  frequently  expressed  his  satisfaction 
that  at  length  his  wishes  and  prayers  were  all  answered  by  my 
arrival  amongst  them.

Siindfty  11th.  I  proachod  in  tho  Churcli  at  Woodhouse  in 
tlie  »?v(Miin&lt;,',  and  afterwards  went  down  to  Vittoria  in  a  slei^^h, 
wIk'J'o  I  road  ev(Miin{j  service  ajijain  and  ureached. 

Tuesday  16th.  I  |)r()cceded  to  Walpoio  aeeonipaniod  l&gt;y  Mr. 
P^vans,  read  the  mornin;^  service  and  i)reached  at  the  house  of 
Mr.  Math(!r  ;  a  very  attentive  conj^re/^ation  was  in  attendance, 
and  after  service  we  drove  to  the  house  of  Mr.  Viner. 

Wednesday  17th.  I  read  the  niorninij  service  and  preached 
in  a  scliool  house  ujton  tJio  Lake  Shore  (Ontario,)  and  tlien  re- 
turned to  Woodhouse.  The  (hiy  was  extremely  cohl,  but  travel- 
lint?  hy  no  means  unpleasant. 

Friday  IDth.  I  sot  out  for  Vienna,  sleifi^him,'  very  ^ood, 
and  in  my  way  I  stopped  at  the  house  of  an  Irislmmn  who 
had  h«!en  formerly  a  member  of  the  Cliurch,  but  in  the  absence 
of  all  her  ministrations  had  joined  the  IJaptist  connection. 

Saturday  20th.  I  went  forward  to  Vienna  and  was  most 
kindly  received  by  Mr.  Draper,  an  attached  member  of  the 
Church,  and  in  the  evening  I  lectured  at  his  house. 

Sunday  21st.  Mr.  Draper  havinj^-  kindly  provided  me  a  horse 
and  cutter,  1  jn'oceoded  at  an  («irly  hour  to  Port  Jiurwell, 
situated  on  Lake  Krie.  Mr.  IJurwell,  abrotlier  of  tho  proi)rietor 
of  the  place,  received  me  very  cordially,  and  immediately  nuido 
an  arrauj^ement  for  holding  the  morning  service  in  the  largo 
room  of  a  lavern,  the  only  i)lace  of  convenient  size  which  coiild 
bo  procured.  1  had  a  very  large  and  attentive  congregation 
assembled  at  tlio  appointed  hour.  'J'o  tho  English  residents  wlio 
had  boon  accust(nnod  to  tlie  services  of  the  sanctuary  at  homo, 
a  great  gratification  seemed  to  be  afforded.  I  was  the  first  minister 
that  ever  ])erformed  divine  service  in  the  place,  as  neither 
Methodist  nor  Baptist  i)rcacher  has  ever  attemi)tod  to  establish 
a.  congregation  hero.  At  the  close  of  tho  morning  prayer,  an 
English  lady  from  London  presented  her  son  to  be  baptized ; 
being  aware  that  some  of  my  congregation  were  probably  wholly 
unacquainted  with  the  nature  of  this  ordinance  as  recognized  by 
our  Church,  I  delivered  a  short  lecture  upon  the  nature  and 
design  of  baptism,  all  listened  with  great  attention,  and  we  had 
a  comforting  time  so  that  truly  many  of  us  might  say  "  It  is 
good  for  us  to  be  here." 

Immediately  after  service,  I  returned  to  tho  village  of 
Vienna.  It  is  most  beautifully  situated  on  Otter  Creek,  afford- 
ing many  advantages  to  the  enterprising  emigrant  from  its  vici- 
nity to  the  Lake  (being  distant  only  three  miles).  I  found  many 
persons  assembled  to  attend  evening  service,  for  the  most  part 
English,  I  might  say  there  were  not  less  than  90  or  100  in  attend- 
ance, I  consideied  at  the  time  that  the  school  house  could  not 
accommodate  more — several  were  compelled  to  stand  during  tho 
service  for  want  of  seats.  Were  a  minister  placed  at  Port  Bur- 
well,  he  could  easily  arrange  to  have  service  here  every  Sunday, 
and  I  am  led  to  believe  that  very  quickly  large  and  regular 
congregations  would  be  established  from  the  many  English  and 
Irish  families  living  in  the  neighbourhood.  These  m  the  absence 
of  any  stated  ministry  are  found  not  only  here,  but  in  almost  all 
places  in  the  district,  to  give  a  listening  to  the  preaching  of  any 
and  every  one,  however  much  opposed  "  to  sound  doctrine"  in

the  day  b^  reading  a  portion  of  scripture,  and  lecturing  to  his 
large  family. 

Monday  22nd.  After  morning  nrayora  with  the  family,  I  set 
off  on  my  way  to  Middleton,  and  had  a  tedious  drive,  rendered 
more  disagreeable  by  a  sudden  thaw.  1  arrived  at  the  liouse  of 
a  Mr.  Tisdale,  the  son  of  an  American  genth'man  who  settled  in 
this  country  at  the  time  of  the  revolution  of  the  United  States. 
I  found  him  anxious  for  the  spread  of  the  trntli,and  tin;  interests 
of  our  venerable  (!hurc!i,  to  which  of  late,  from  conviction  of  the 
purity  of  its  creed,  and  tlie  solemn  simjjlicity  of  its  ritual,  he  has 
become  most  warmly  attached.  He  has  kindly  oi)oned  a  door 
in  this  hitherto  neglected  spot,  for  the  i)reaching  of  the  word  of 
life.  As  there  is  no  Sehool-liouse  convenient,  he  gladlv  gives 
me  the  use  of  his  house  ;  a  small  ccmgregation,  some  ot  whom 
came  many  miles,  attended,  and  it  is  to  bo  hoped  that  by 
regular  preaching  a  considernblo  congregation  would  soon  be 
established  in  this  jjlace.  'I'his  neighbourhood  is  occawionally 
visited  by  Methodist  and  Haj)tist  Ministers.  I  closed  the  day  by 
reading  a  portion  of  Scripture  and  ]&gt;rayor,  in  which  the  family 
seemed  to  join  from  their  hearts.  I  distributed  many  Tracts 
here  and  in  other  places,  which  were  every  where  most  thank- 
fully received.  I  visited  an  English  family  of  the  name  of 
Tims,  from  (iloucestershire.  Here  I  read  ])art  of  a  chapter  and 
made  a  few  remarks  upon  it,  which  I  consi&lt;lered  suitable  to  our 
situation,  closing  with  i)rayer.  Mrs.  Tims  strongly  expresse&lt;l 
her  pleasure  at  the  hope  of  now  being  enablecl  to  join  the 
services  of  the  Church,  as  often  as  my  periodical  visits  as 
Travelling  Missionary  afforded  opportunity.  I  am  not  in  the 
least  surprised  that  so  many  members  of  our  communion  join 
themselves  to  Dissenters  of  various  denominations,  despairing 
as  they  do,  of  ever  having  a  Minister  established  in  the  remote 
Settlements  where  they  have  purchased  lands.  It  is  my  opinion 
from  what  I  have  already  observed  since  I  came  amongst  them, 
that  were  it  possible  to  locate  Clergymen,  devoted  to  the  service 
of  their  Master,  so  that  they  could  from  different  Missionary 
Stations  visit  these  scattered  sheep,  and  making  their  own 
residence  the  centre  of  their  sphere  of  action,  Dissent  would  be 
little  heard  of  here  ;  the  Church  would  in  this  country  be 
established  on  as  firm  a  basis,  in  the  hearts  of  the  i)eople,  as 
ever  it  has  been  at  home  ;  the  cause  of  the  Gospel  would 
flourish  and  spread,  and  we  should  have  strong  ground  for 
the  trust,  that  the  Lord  would  recognize  the  work  as  his  own, 
and  seal  it  with  his  most  Holy  Spirit. 

Tuesday  23rd.  After  family  prayers,  I  set  out  as  soon  as  I 
had  breakfasted  for  Burford,  a  drive  of  twenty-five  miles — th 
roads  in  many  places  covered  with  water,  in  consequence  of  the 
continued  thaw.  After  much  diffic^ilty  to  discover  the  proper 
road  to  the  place  of  my  appointment,  the  evening  had  nearly 
set  in  by  the  time  I  reached  Mr.  Moore's.  As  soon  as  I  informed 
this  family  of  the  nature  of  my  visit,  they  received  me  most 
cordially.  At  the  appointed  hour,  seven  o'clock,  I  proceeded  to 
the  school  house  and  preached  to  a  good  congregation,  and 
after  service  returned  to  the  house  of  Mr.  Moore.    All  seemed

;ind  well  prepared  for  rest,  retired  to  hod. 

Wednesday  24th.  In  tho  morning  I  Iwtnred  from  the  Inst 
part  of  ,Iohn  xxi.,  and  then  proet^edud  to  llhmdford.  On  my 
way  I  called  upon  a  family  much  attached  to  the  Church,  read 
;i  chapter  and  jiraved  with  them.  IJcing  by  mistaki?  of  name 
•iirected  to  Jiranttord  instead  of  lUntidford,  I  called  upon  the 
Kev.  Mr.  IjUgger,  a  brother  in  the  best  bonds  of  the  (rOHjicl,  and 
was  sorry  to  find  him  confined  to  his  bed  by  a  dangerous  illness, 
but  rejoiced  to  perceive  him  resigned  to  tho  will  and  mind  of 
.lesus,  and  wishing  to  be  passively  in  tho  hands  of  his  (Jod. 

Thursday  2.5th,  I  proceeded  on  my  way  to  Hlandford  ii 
distance  of  about  thirty  miles,  and  called  in  my  journey  upon 
the  Key.  "W.  Betteridge.  I  trust  ho  is  Avholly  given  to  the  work 
of  the  (rospel.  1  found  in  him  a  kind  friend  and  an  affectionate 
brother  in  Christ. 

Friday  and  rtaturdny,  2fith  and  27th,  I  visited  an  Indian 
family  in  their  miserable  wigwam,  formed  of  a  few  branches  of 
fir  trees,  using  a  blanket  as  a  door,  wiiicdi  as  readily  admitted 
the  cold  and  bitter  blasts  as  it  did  its  wretched  inmates.  They 
Mcmi'd  to  suff(»r  no  inconvonienco  from  tho  severity  of  tlu' 
weather  :  and  although  tho  snow  lay  around  upon  the  ground 
to  tlie  de[)th  of  nearly  two  feet,  they  ap])eared  to  heed  it  very 
little,  and  to  enjoy  themselves  as  much  as  nniny  at  home  would 
do  in  their  comfortable  dwellings.  Iloing  wholly  unacquainted 
with  their  language,  I  had  no  opportunity  to  8j)eak  to  them  of 
•lesiis. 

Sunday  28th,  I  preached  at  Blanford  Cliurch — the  congre- 
gation large  and  highly  respectable,  consisting  of  English  Kmi- 
-^Tiuts.  Admiral  Vansittart  has  settled  in  the  neif-hbourhood 
and  has  exerted  himself  very  Avarmly  and  sincerely  in  promoting 
the  best  interests  of  the  gospel  here. 

Monday  29th,  and  Tuesday  March  1st,  I  drove  to  Burford, 
and  stopped  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Timmerman  :  I  lectured  on  tlu* 
K5th  Psalm. 

MARCH. 

Wednesday  2d.  After  family  prayer,  I  walked  to  the  Irish 
settlement,  an&lt;i  here  I  might  almost  say  in  the  language  of 
scripture  **  they  were  waiting  for  me,  to  hear  me  preach  unto 
them  Jesus."  I  held  the  service  in  tho  school  house  and  enjoyed 
a  most  happy  time — surely  the  Lord  is  very  gracious  unto  his 
people.  My  Mission  has  caused  no  small  stir  in  every  place 
which  I  have  visited  ;  and  the  prospect  of  stated  services  seems 
to  gladden  the  hearts  of  the  poor  Emigrants. 

Thursday  3rd.  Again  after  morning  prayer  with  the  family, 
I  visited  a  few  families,  reading  the  scriptures  and  praying  with 
tliem — and  then  set  out  on  my  return  to  Woodhouse — whore  I 
was  most  aflfectionately  received  by  my  highly  valued  fellow 
labourer  in  the  gospel,  Mr.  Evans.  Words  can  very  inadequately 
express  my  strong  sense  of  gratitude  for  the  extreme  kindness 
I  have  received  from  every  member  of  this  household.

of  a  stranger.  At  length  perctjivinj^  at  a  distance  the  faint

holding  divine  service,  tired  with  my  lonjjf  and  cold  journey,  I 
cxpresHod  a  wish,  if  it  were  convenient,  to  be  allowed  some  place

all  my  wanderin;j;s  in  sound  and  refreshinjif  sleep. 

Sunday  Gth.  J  arose  very  early  in  order  to  be  in  time  for  my 
appoi.itmeni  at  eleven  o'clock,     rrevious  to  my  departure  from 
tliis  kind  host,  I  asked  what  the  charge  was  for  myself  and  my 
poor  horse.  "  Nothin«if  sir,"  was  his  prompt  reply,  and  I  departed 
truly  grateful  for  tlie  warm  hospitality  of  my  stranger  friend.     I 
witnessed  this  day  one  melancholy  residt  of  the  absence  of  the 
outward  means  ot  gi'ace.     A  large  congregation  having  assembled 
at  the  appointed  hour,  a  few  hod  prayer  books,  b«t  did  not  know 
iiow  to  use  them.     Many  of  thorn,  born  in  this  country,  never

Minister  preach — one  told  mo  so — another  remarked,  the  prayer 
books  are  of  no  use  to  w^  as  we  cannot,  and  do  not  know  how  to 
find  the  i)lacos,  not  ba^  iiig  used  them  in  public  service  for  tlie 
last  fourteen  years.     After  the  morning  service,  1  proceeded  ttt 
the  Lake  shore,  and  fou?i'^  a  good  congregation,  notwithstanding 
tlic  severity  of  tlie  day,  which  blew  a  tremendous  gale  oti^"  the

service  I  walked  to  the  house  of  Mr.  Pughsley,  an  English  gentle- 
man ;   be  j  with  others  rejoiced   in  the  prospect    of  occasional 
services,  remarking  "  the  only  draw  back  to  this  country  is  the 
"  want  of  Churclies  and  Clergymen.    It  is  a  fine  country  for  poor 
"  men,  but  for  my  part  I  have  had  often  serious  thoughts  of 
"  leaving  my  present  residence ;  and  settling  again  near  the  moans 
"  of  grace."    Such  is  the  tale  of  almost  all  the  Settlers  in  the 
woods — may  their  songs  of  sorrow  soon  be  turned  into  the  shout 
of  tl.  ^nksg'ving — we  ended  the  day  by  singing  a  hymn,  reading; 
a  psabn  and  prayer.

Monday  7th.  This  morning  I  called  upon  a  few  scattered 
families,  reading  and  praying  witli  them  ;  and  then  pursued  my 
way  to  Stony  Creek,  a  distance  of  about  nine  miles  ;  and  preache'J 
in  the  evening  to  a  large  congregation,  from  seventy  to  eighty 
people — Baptists,  Methodists,  and  Church  people.  I  rested  at 
the  house  oi  a  Mr.  Evans,  a  member  of  the  Methodist  connection 
— he  having  read  the  6th  chapter  of  Matthew,  I  commented  at 
some  length  on  t'-  spirituality  of  the  law,  pointing  out  the  rich 
provision  made  in  che  gospel.  I  distributed  several  tracts,  which 
were  received  with  apparent  pleasure — I  pray  the  Lord  may  bless 
them  in  the  reading  to  the  souls  of  many- 
Tuesday  8th.  I  proceeded  to  Dover,  about  twenty  miles, 
where  I  read  the  morning  service  and  preached  from  Romans, 
5th  chapter  1  st  verse.  I  was  met  here  by  my  kind  friend  Mr. 
Evans,  of  Woodhou«!e,  and  accompanied  him  home — a  home 
which  he  and  his  truly  excellent  partner  have  endeavoured  to 
make  miua^— may  the  good  Lord  reward  him  and  all  his  household 
very  abundantly. 

Wednesday  9th.  After  breakfast  I  set  out  to  Windham, 
held  evening  service  and  preached  in  the  school  house.  I  had  a 
good  congregation,  many  of  them  Settlers  from  New  Brunswick, 
much  attached  to  the  Churcli. 

Thmsday  10th.  I  visited  several  families,  and  lectured  c 
Mr.  Tisdale's,  from  Psalm  Ixxxv.  v.  5.  This  gentleman  suffers 
much  from  a  protracted  jjaiuful  illness,  and  I  have  reason  to  hope 
he  has  built  upon  llim  who  isi  able  to  comfort  his  afflicted  people. 
In  the  e/ening  I  drove  to  Simcoe,  held  evening  service  and 
preached  in  the  school  house — and  afterwards  returned  again  to 
my  kind  friend  at  Woodhouse — Mr.  Evans  having  accompanied 
me  in  all  my  visits  of  the  last  few  days — fully  realized  the  wisdom 
of  our  dear  Redoomcr,  sending  his  disciples  "  two  and  two." 

Saturday  11th.  The  roads  being  very  deep  from  a  heavy 
fall  of  snow,  I  set  out,  a  bitter  cold  day,  for  Vienna ;  but  in 
consequence  of^he  state  of  the  roads,  could  only  make  out  about 
twenty  miles. 

Sunday  12th.  I  proceeded  at  an  early  hour  to  Vienna, 
the  morning  gloomy,  and  heavy  squalls  of  snow  constantly 
falling.  A  large  congregation  was  however  in  attendance, 
notwithstanding  the  storminess  of  the  day  ;  so  eager  are  the 
people,  with  little  exception,  to  attend  divine  worship.  In  the 
I  proceeded  to  Port  Burwell,  and  there  also  found  a 


evening 


large  congregation  assembled.  After  service  I  baptized  a  little 
boy.  The  whole  distance  travelled  this  day,  to  keep  these 
appointments,  was  about  twenty-four  miles. 

Monday  13th  to  15th,  I  remained  at  Vienna,  visiting  different 
scattered  families,  and  distributing  Tracts ;  and  held  evening 
service  on  the  15th  in  the  school  house,  and  preached  to  a  small 
congregation. 

Thursday  16th.  I  left  this  Settlement,  and  proceeded  to 
another  in  Middleton,  distant  about  sixteen  miles ;  held  evening 
service  and  preached  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdale  ;  and  after 
service  lectured  on  the  xvii.  chap,  of  St.  John. 

Friday  17th.  In  my  way  to  Burford  I  baptized  two  children, 
first  lecturing  on  the  nature  of  the  ordnance  ;  and  reached  the

honse  of  Mr.  Moore,  where  I  closed  the  day  by  reading  to  tlie 
family  the  29th  Psalm  and  prayer. 

Saturdav  18th.  I  visited  again  the  Irish  settlement  in  the 
evening,  and  we  sang  the  different  Psalms  for  the  ap[&gt;roacliing 
Sabbath,  in  the  house  of  Mr.  Gage,  where  many  of  my  'jongrega- 
kion  had  assembled. 

Sunday  19th.  I  held  morning  service  in  the  school  house  at 
IJurford,  aiid  preached  from  Psal.  cxxx.  v.  4.  In  the  evening  I 
icturned  again  to  the  Irish  settlement,  to  hold  a  second  service 
— a  very  large  congregation  attended  in  both  places,  especially 
the  last,  nearly  all  firmly  attached  members  of  the  Cliurch  ;  I 
letumed  after  service  to  the  house  of  Mr.  Moore. 

Monday  20th.  I  went  again  to  the  Irish  settlement,  to  hold 
service  in  the  school  house,  and  found,  as  usual,  a  large  congre- 
gation assembled,  aud  upon  this  occasion  I  was  kindly  received 
iu  the  house  of  Air.  Clements. 

Tuesday  21st.  I  attended  a  funeral  this  day,  and  preached 
the  funeral  sermon,  in  tlie  house  of  -.' '  r.  Moore  ;  every  one  seemed 
to  listen  with  deep  solemnity — truly  may  we  say  "  in  the  midst 
of  life,  we  are  in  death" — the  relations  of  the  deceased  attended 
my  preaching  at  the  Irish  settlement  on  Sunday  evening  previous, 
and  left  him  apparently  in  as  good  a  state  of  health,  as  nt  any 
other  time  of  late  ;  and  alas  !  after  their  return  to  their  home, 
they  found  his  spirit  had  fled  from  its  earthly  tenement.  Had  1 
not  happened  to  be  iu  the  neighbourhood,  the  friends  would  have 
been  compelled  to  commit  his  ashes  to  the  grave  without  the 
decorum  of  christian  burial — only  those  who  live  here,  and  have 
an  opportunity  of  witnessing  the  destitution  of  this  country,  can 
fully  know  or  feel  how  bitter  a  thing  it  is  to  be  obliged  to  cover 
up  their  dead  without  the  solemn  rites  and  attendance  of  a 
christian  minister. 

Wednesday  22nd.  I  returned  to  Simcoe,  very  much  worn 
out  and  fatigued  by  the  continual  travelling  and  speaking. 

Thursday  23rd.  I  visited  a  Church  family  at  Simcoe  this 
evening,  and  lectured  in  their  house  from  Psal.  ii. 

Friday  24th.  Accompanied  by  the  Rev.  F.  Evans  I  attended 
a  funeral :  he  was  kind  enough  to  preach  for  me  from  Romans 
vi.  v.  23.  I  prayed  with  the  family  and  a  few  friends  of  the 
parents  of  the  child,  who  had  assembled  to  attend  the  funeral. 

Satur«lay  25th.  I  left  Simcoe  again  for  the  long  Settlement, 
and  had  a  cold  and  dreary  drive  through  two  large  forests. 
Surely  it  is  oiily  the  gre«»t  work  in  hand  which  could  fully  sup- 
port the  mind  under  the  various  difficulties  and  privations  to 
be  encountered  in  the  arduous  life  of  a  Missionary  !     Who  ! 

0  Lord,  being  in  the  flesh,  is  sufficient  for  these  things  i  No 
one  :  all  strength  and  sufficiency  must  be  from  on  high. 

Sunday  Siiith.  Read  the  morning  service  at  the  long  Settle- 
ment, to  an  immense  congregation,  who  had  assembled  from 
far  and  near ;  many  had  come  very  great  distances  to  attend. 

1  preached  from  Heb.  xi. :  "  By  feith  Moses,"  &amp;c.  Immediately 
after  the  service,  I  proceeded  to  the  lake  shore,  to  hold  evening 
service.  I  had  a  very  full  attendance.  Preached  in  the  school 
house  ;  and  closed  the  da^  by  reading  a  psalm,  and  prayer,  with 
the  families  of  Messrs.  Wood  and  Pughsley.

Monday  27th.  After  family  worship,  I  a^ain  set  forward  to 
reac.  Stony  Creek,  where  I  held  evening  service  and  preached 
from  John  xix  :  "  Behold  the  Man."  I  slept  at  the  house  uf 
Mr.  Hill. 

Tuesday  28th.  Mr.  Hill  kindly  drove  me  to  Rainham,  and 
introduced  me  to  the  household  of  a  Mr.  Evans,  who  is  sincerely 
attached  to  the  Church,  and  with  many  others,  English  Emi- 
grants, is  extremely  anxious  to  secure  the  services  of  a  Minister. 
Many  assembled  for  evening  prayer.  After  the  service  I  bap- 
tized five  children.  Frequently  during  the  evening,  Mr.  Evans 
and  others  expressed  the  most  heartfelt  satisfaction  at  the  pros- 
pect of  again  hearing  a  Minister  of  their  Church. 

Wednesday  2yth.  In  the  morning,  many  persons  being 
present,  I  lectured  from  a  portion  of  Scripure,  which  was 
pointed  out  by  a  member  of  the  family.  I  then  set  out  for 
Woodhouse,  a  distance  of  about  thii  ty  miles,  and  found  much 
difficulty  in  passing,  with  the  cutter,  some  of  the  streams  which 
were  swollen  by  the  thaw,  and  the  ice  so  weakened  as  not  to 
support  the  horse.  How  uncertain  are  all  things  in  this  life  ! 
when  I  hoped  that  I  had  overcome  all  my  difficulties,  and  to 
reach  the  end  of  my  journey,  I  was  xi])set ;  the  ice  broke  in  one 
place,  upon  which  the  horse  became  so  much  frightened,  that  in 
endeavouring  to  free  himself,  he  became  so  hampered  with  the 
sleigh  and  harness,  that  he  was  dragged  under  the  ice  by  the 
stream  ;  in  my  own  eftbrts  to  extricate  the  poor  animal,  my  life 
was  in  imminent  danger,  and  I  was  struck  down  twice  by  his 
plunges  amid  the  broken  ice  and  water.  After  s  jrae  danger  and 
much  difficulty,  I  succeeded  in  raising  his  head  above  the  water, 
and  resting  it  upon  a  piece  of  broken  ice,  so  as  to  prevent  his 
being  smothered ;  and  after  some  delay,  I  procured  the  assis- 
tance of  an  old  man,  who  was  living  at  no  great  distance  from 
the  place.  With  his  help  I  contrived  at  last  to  free  the  horse  ; 
but  had  he  remained  only  a  few  minutes  longer  in  the  water,  he 
must  have  died  from  the  extreme  cold.  I  was  apprehensive 
that  my  own  leo;s  were  frozen  ;  but  happily,  through  the  cf,re 
and  keeping  of  tue  Most  High,  I  suiferetl  no  further  inconve- 
nience than  what  I  endured  at  the  time.  Ma;,  f  show  forth  my 
gratitude  for  this  preservation,  by  a  life  devoted  to  the  honour 
and  glory  of  God  my  saviour. 

Thursday  30th.  I  proceeded  to  Woodhouse,  where  I  found 
myself  received  with  accustomed  kindness  by  the  Rev.  Mr. 
Evans.  -  - 

APRIL. 

Friday  1st.  I  read  the  morning  service  and  preached  upon 
the  text,  '*  It  is  fiuished."  The  congregation  was  rather  sma)', 
but  deeply  attentive.  It  was  composed  of  Methodists  and 
Church  people.  ^ 

fee:  urday  2nd,  I  remained  at  Woodhouse. 

Sunday  3d.  I  joined  with  the  Lord's  people  in  receiving 
this  day  the  dying  pledge  of  a  Redeemer's  love.  In  the  evening 
I  held  evening  service  at  Simcoe,  and  preached.

Tuesday  5th.  I  contrived  to  travel  about  nine  miles,  and 
preached  in  the  Dover  Schools ;  and  although  the  roads  were 
so  deep,  I  had  a  large  congregation. 

Wednesday,  Thursday,  and  Friday,  6th,  7th,  and  8th.  Com- 
pelled by  the  roads  to  rest. 

Saturday  9th.  I  was  obliged  by  an  appointment  to  set  out 
for  "Windham  this  morning.  After  travelling  very  slowly,  the 
horse  nearly  up  to  the  knees  every  step,  the  bridges  and  cause- 
ways all  covered  with  water,  in  consequence  of  the  heavy  rain, 
I  at  last  reached  my  destination,  and  was  kindly  received  by 
Mr.  Bobins. 

Sunday  10th.  I  read  the  morning  service  and  preached  in  the 
school-house,  and  although  the  day  was  so  extremely  unfavour- 
able, a  large  congi-egation  were  assembled.  1  then  rode  back  to 
SimcQO  to  hold  a  second  service,  wiiere  I  preached  ujjon  the 
text,  Horn,  i,  16,  "  I  am  not  ashamed,  &amp;c."  Being  invited  to  the 
house  of  Mrs.  Salmon,  where  I  was  kindly  and  comfortably 
lodged,  she  assembled  tho  servants  and  members  of  her  family, 
and  I  explained  part  of  a  chapter  from  tlie  book  of  Exodus. 

Monday  11th.  After  family  prayer  I  returned  to  the  hos- 
pitable mansion  of  my  ever  kind  friend  Mr.  Evans,  at  Wood- 
house. 

Tuesday  12th  and  Wednesday  13th,  I  devoted  to  the  visit- 
ing of  man^  scattered  families  in  the  neighbourhood.  An  ample 
field  of  action  in  every  section  of  this  wilderness  presents  itself. 

Thursday  14th.  I  drove  this  day  to  Dover,  read  the  evening 
service  and  preached  upon  the  text,  "  This  day  shalt  thou  be 
with  me  in  Paradise."  May  the  Lord  soon  raise  up  many  stan- 
dard bearers  of  the  cross,  and  send  them  to  this  long  neglected 
and  benighted  land.  Alas  !  with  the  name  of  Christian,  how 
many  are  living  and  dying  here  in  a  worse  than  Heathen  dark- 
ness ! 

Friday  15th  and  Saturday  16th.  I  visited  a  sick  and  ap- 
parently dying  saint,  found  her  patient  and  resigned  ;  upon  each 
occasiuii  I  read  a  portion  of  scripture,  and  joined  the  family  in 
commending  her  in  prayer  to  the  care  and  faithful  keeping  of 
the  Most  High. 

Sunday  17th.  I  read  prayers  and  preach  'n  the  Church  at 
Woodhouse — text,  Isaiah,  i,  18.  The  congregation  was  large, 
and  in  the  evening  I  drove  to  Dover  school  house,  near  the  Lake 
Shore,  where  I  read  the  evening  service  and  preached  to  a  con- 
gregation of  seventy  or  eighty,  many  of  them  Methodists,  but  all 
have  greeted  me  cordially,  and  have  bidden  me  "  God  speed." 
My  text  this  evening — "  Christ  is  all." 

From  Monday  18th  to  Wednesday  20th.  I  remained  visit- 
ing the  neighbourhood  of  Woodhouse. 

Thursday  21st.  I  set  out  again  to  Windham  on  a  wi-etchedly 
wet  day,  and  after  a  tedious  and  uncomfortable  journey,  reached 
the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdale.  In  the  evening  his  large  family 
having  assembled,  I  read  a  portion  of  the  word  of  life  and 
lectured. 

Friday  22nd.  I  was  requested  to  visit  an  aged  man  who  was 
sick,  living  within  about  two  miles  of  Mr.  Tisdale's.  A  member 
of  the  family  having  accompanied  me  as  my  guide  through  the

woods,  after  some  interesting  conversation  with  an  ancient 
pilgrim  in  the  vale  of  life,  I  proposed  reading  to  him  a  part  of 
scripture.  The  offer  was  gladly  accepted,  and  the  several  mcm- 
liers  of  the  family  being  assembled,  I  read  and  prayed  with 
them.  Having  committed  him  to  the  King  of  Israel  who  neither 
slumbers  nor  sleeps,  I  bade  the  family  farewell,  not,  however, 
before  I  was  requested  to  renew  my  visit,  as  soon,  and  as  often, 
as  my  other  engagements  elsewhere  would  allow  me  time  and 
opportunity.  In  the  evening  I  read  part  of  Genesis,  7th  chapter, 
and  expoimded,  on  my  return  to  Mr.  Tisdale's. 

Saturday  23rd.  I  left  Windham  for  Burford,  having  left  my 
horse  at  Mr.  Moore's  I  walked  to  the  Irish  Settlement,  to  leavV 
an  appointment  for  the  next  day ;  and  was  very  kindly  re- 
ceived by  Mr.  Clements,  an  Irish  emigrant,  very  much  attached 
to  the  Church.  Tlie  un-ival  of  an  Episcoi)al  missionary  was 
hailed  with  delight  by  all  in  this  settlement. 

Sunday  24th.  I  arose  early  to  return  to  the  Moore  Settle- 
ment, where  I  read  prayers  and  preached,  and  I  cannot  but 
remark  here,  that  it  would  be  very  desirable,  if  clergymen  could 
not  be  obtained  for  these  several  congregations  scattered  throiigh- 
out  these  wild  districts,  had  they  even  the  services  of  faithful 
and  competent  catechists,  at  small  salaries,  if  these  could  be 
secured  to  them.  They  would  help  (1  Cor.  xii,  28.)  under  the 
Divine  blessing  to  keep  together  the  scattered  fold  until  a 
brighter  day  should  dawn.  TJio  congregation  here,  chiefly  Cana- 
dians, all  strongly  devoted  to  the  Church  of  England.  After  the 
morning  prayers,  I  rode  to  the  Irish  settlement,  read  prayers 
and  preached.  The  attendance  on  this  occasion  not  so  large  as 
formerly. 

Monday  25.  I  visited  a  sick  woman  in  the  morning  and 
read  and  prayed  with  her.  I  then  visited  another  Church  iamily 
in  tlio  evening,  read  j)art  of  the  first  chapter  of  St.  Luke,  and  com- 
mented upon  a  few  verses,  and  closed  with  prayer.  It  is  truly 
pleasant  to  perceive  with  wliat  evident  satisfaction  these  visits 
are  received,  and  with  what  attention  and  interest  these /re-«M/«; 
sermons  are  listened  to. 

Tuesday  26th.  I  visited  several  families  in  the  neighbour- 
hood in  the  early  part  of  the  day,  and  in  the  evening  read  ser- 
vice and  preached  IVora  Heb.  ii,  2,  "  How  shall  we  escape,"  in 
the  Moore  school  house.  I  felt  delighted  with  the  fervent 
manner  in  which  the  congregation  joined  in  the  responses,  an 
unction  from  on  high  seemed  to  prevail  throughout  the  whole. 
The  congregation  was  very  large  and  chiefly  members  of  the 
Church. 

Wednesday  27th.  I  rode  to  the  Irish  settlement  where  I 
read  pi*ayers  and  preached  in  the  school  house,  to  a  large  and 
attentive  congregation,  chiefly  Irish  emigrants  from  the  northern 
counties.  There  were  also  present  a  few  members  of  the 
Methodist  connexion,  who  attend  very  regula  'y  whenever  I 
hold  service  in  the  neighbourhood. 

Thursday  28th.  Not  being  in  full  orders  I  was  obliged  to 
travel  twenty  miles  to  request  my  kind  friend  Mr.  Evans  to  visit 
a  sick  member  of  the  Church,  who  expressed  great  anxiety  to 
receive  the  sacrament.    I  had  a  long  conversation  with  her  on 


193 


:"^y 


the  nature  of  that  ordinance,  and  hope  she  had  conceived  a  clear 
and  scriptural  view  of  the  sacrament.  After  a  slow  and  dreary 
ride  to  Woodhouse,  I  lectured  to  about  fifteen  persons  in  the 
evening,  assembled  at  Mr.  Evans'. 

Friday  29th.  I  rode  this  day  to  Middleton,  twenty-two  miles 
distant,  where  I  read  a  psalm  and  lectured,  closing  with  prayer, 
at  the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdale. 

Saturday  30th.  After  family  prayer  I  proceeded  again  on 
my  way  to  Vienna,  a  distance  of  seventeen  miles,  and  was  very 
kindly  received  by  Mr.  Draper.  In  the  evening  I  walked  about 
a  mile  to  visit  a  sick  person,  I  held  a  long  and  interesting  con- 
versation with  her  upon  the  nature  of  affliction,  the  happiness 
and  glory  of  the  Lord's  children  in  heaven,  and  before  leaving, 
the  house  I  read  a  psalm  and  prayed  with  the  family. 

MAY. 

Sunday  1st.  I  officiated  twice  in  the  school  house  at  Vienna, 
and  on  both  occasions  had  large  and  apparently  attentive  con- 
gregations. I  proposed  to  them  the  establishment  of  a  Sunday 
school,  but  regret  to  say  the  subject  did  not  receive  the  attention 
it  deserved.*  A  difficulty  existed  infiuding  a  suitable  person  to 
superintend  it — a  fresh  instance  of  the  advantage  to  be  derived 
from  the  residence  of  a  Minister  among  them,  and  of  the  disad- 
vantages which  result  from  the  present  state  of  things. 

Monday  2nd.  In  the  evening  I  rode  to  Port  Burwell,  but  as 
my  visit  was  unexpected,  I  had  no  opportunity  of  gathering  a 
congregation,  but  leaving  an  appointment  for  Sunday  fortnight, 
if  I  was  spared,  I  returned  to  Mr.  Draper's. 

Tuesday  3rd.  I  visited  Mrs.  Tims  and  found  her  suffering 
extremely,  I  read  and  prayed  with  her,  and  had  reason  to  hope, 
she  is  stayed  upon  **  tlie  rock  of  ages ;"  amid  all  her  pains  and 
sufferings  lier  soul  seems  to  rest  calmly  on  Him  wlio  is  the  com- 
fort and  joy  of  his  people ;  calling  again  in  the  afternoon  I  found 
her  apparently  worse.  In  the  evening  I  lectured  and  baptized 
the  child  of  a  gentleman,  named  Crawford,  from  Jamaica,  many 
of  his  friends  were  present,  and  seemed  lo  take  an  attentive  in- 
terest in  the  service. 

Wednesday  4th.  I  set  out  to  Middleton,  calling  in  my  way 
'ipon  Mrs.  Tims,  and  found  her  better,  the  family  appeared  much 
gratified  by  my  visits.  Poor  people  !  so  long  was  it  since  any 
Minister  of  their  Church  had  visited  them,  and  that  but  once 
since  their  emigration,  they  seemed  overjoyed  with  the  antici- 
pation of  soon  beholding  the  place  of  their  residence  the  home 
of  their  adoption,  somewhat  more  like  the  home  they  had  left,  by 
the  erection  of  a  Church,  the  establishment  of  a  Sabbath  school, 
and  in  time  the  residence  of  a  Minister.  May  all  these  hopes  be 
quickly  realized  to  them.  Proceeding  on  my  way  I  preaclied  in 
the  school  house  in  Talbot-street — my  congregation  cou);/Osed  of 
Methodists,  Baptists,  and  some  few  members  of  the  Ch  urch. 

Tuesday  5th.  I  went  on  to  the  township  jf  Woodhoure,  and 

on  the  way  baptized  the  child  of  a  Presbyterian  from  the  north 

of  Ireland,  I  delivered  a  short  lecture  on  baptism.    Although 

the  members  of  this  family  did  not  belong  to  the  Church  before

emigration,  they  expressed  a  wann  wish  of  soon  seeinjj  a  Chunh 
riniu^  up  amongst  them.  I  find,  with  little  exception,  that  the 
Dissenters  who  liave  come  out  to  tliis  country,  give  a  decidod 
preference  to  the  services  of  our  Churcii,  rather  than  to  any  other 
afiPorded  here. 

Friday  6th,  and  Saturday  7th.  I  rode  from  Woodhouso  to  an 
English  and  Scotch  settlement  on  the  shores  of  Lake  Erie,  and 
was  kindly  received  at  Waveny  Cottage,  by  the  proprietor  and 
his  brother — I  was  extremely  fatigued  by  this  long  ride — as  the 
road  was  only  cut  out,  it  required  i-'onstant  toil  to  escape  the  bad 
spots;  I  was  frequently  obliged  to  dismount  and  to  lead  my  horse 
up  some  very  high  banks  along  the  shore,  and  sometimes  even  to 
enter  the  wood,  where  the  thick  and  tan&lt;;led  underwood  and 
fallen  trees  presented  often  no  trivial  barrier. 

Sunday  8th.  I  officiated  in  the  school  house  on  the  Ijake 
Shore,  to  a  congregation,  comparatively  sj)ea'ang,  good.  And 
in  the  evening  I  lectured  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Mercer  to  a  small 
congregation  of  Scotch  people,  resident  in  the  neighbourhood. 

Monday  Utli.  1  again  left  Mr.  Mercer's  for  the  township  of 
Woodhouse,  and  in  my  way  was  obliged  to  swim  my  horse 
across  a  deep  creek,  tne  brdges  having  been  carried  away  by 
the  freshes  occasioned  by  the  melting  of  the  snow  and  rain  in 
the  beginning  of  spring.  I  rode  to  tlie  house  of  a  Canadian  of 
the  name  of  Park,  a  member  of  the  Church,  where  I  lectured  to 
a  small  congregation,  chiefly  Baptists,  removing  to  Michigan. 

Tuesday  10th.  I  pursued  my  way  to  the  fiev.  F.  Evans'  at 
Woodhouse,  where  I  remained  till 

Fi'iday  13th.  This  day  I  accompanied  my  friend  to  visit  a 
family  near  the  lake,  where  I  read  prayers  and  commented  upon 
a  part  of  the  5th  of  St.  Luke. 

Sunday  15th.  I  visited  the  Sunday  school,  and  examined 
the  first  class  ;  and  was  glad  to  perceive  great  good  likely  to 
arise  from  this  institution.  A  very  neat  school  house  has  been 
built  under  the  direction  of  Mr.  Evans.  The  school  receives  as 
much  time  as  his  many  other  engagements  permit  him  on  this 
day  to  devote  to  it ;  he  is,  however,  ably  assisted  by  the  care 
and  attention  which  Mrs.  Evans  gives  it ;  and  we  may  trust 
that  under  the  Divine  blessing,  it  will  prove  very  profitable  to 
the  people.  Mr.  Evans  having  exchanged  services  with  me,  I 
officiated  in  his  Church  at  eleven  o'clock,  and  then  rode  to 
Windham  to  hold  a  second  service  at  half-oast  three  ;  then 
returning  to  Simcoe,  I  had  a  third  service  in  the  school  house 
there.  I  had  large  congregations  in  all  places,  but  especially  so 
at  the  Woodhouse  Church  and  Windham. 

I  remained  at  Woodhouse  on  the  16th,  and  left  it  in  the 
evening  of  Tuesday  1 7th,  accompanied  by  Mr.  Evans,  to  attend 
a  clerical  meeting  in  the  house  of  the  Rev.  W.  Betteridge,  our 
drive  about  twenty-five  miles. 

Wednesday  18th.  We  started  again  at  four  in  the  morning 
to  prosecute  our  route,  and  received  this  day  a  fresh  pledge  of 
the  love  of  God,  One  of  the  wheels  of  the  cart  sinking  into 
a  mud-hole  unepectedly,  I  was  thrown  out  under  the  wheels,  yet 
suffered  no  injury.  About  half-past  nine  we  met  our  Reverend 
brethren,  and  the  Rev.  B.  Cronyu  was  called  to  the  chair.    The

The 


meeting  was  Commenced  with  prayer,  find  next  the  ordination 
service  for  Priests  Orders  was  read.  The  first  five  verses  of 
Rom.  V.  was  then  discussed,  eliciting  during  the  time  allowed, 
some  very  interesting  and  original  remarks.  In  the  evening  the 
subject  of  Convocation  was  proposed  l)y  the  Archdeacon  ;  the 
measure  seemed  to  receive  the  approbation  of  every  Clergyman 
jiresent,  as  one  well  calculated  to  advance  the  interests  of  the 
Church  in  the  colony. 

Thursday  19th.  The  Archdeacon  of  York  preached:  prayers 
were  read  by  the  Rev.  II.  O.  Niel.  The  singmg  was  good,  and 
a  large  and  respectable  congrt'gation  assembled ;  and  soon  after 
the  service  we  left  for  Burford,  and 

Friday  20,  returned  to  Woodhouse. 

Saturday  21st.  The  Archdeacon  of  York  having  kindly 
undertaken  to  preacli  at  Port  liurwell,  I  set  out  for  Brandtford, 
to  do  the  duty  in  the  absence  of  the  Rev.  R.  Lugger,  who  was 
jrompelled  by  his  ill  health  to  leave  his  home  for  a  time.  Not 
being  able  to  travel  the  whole  distance. 

Sunday  22nd.  I  rode  forward  early  in  the  morning,  and 
found  no  little  difficulty  in  making  my  way  through  the  woods. 
1  officiated  twice  durnig  the  day.  There  is  here  a  large  con- 
gregation and  a  very  nice  Church,  but  at  present  no  resident 
Clergyman.  In  the  evening,  a  few  friends  having  assembled,  I 
delivered  a  short  lecture,  and  closed  the  day  with  prayer. 

Monday  23rd.  I  drove  to  the  Mohawk  village,  visited  the 
school,  heard  the  children  read  and  sing  a  hynm  in  the  Mohawk 
tongue,  and  also  in  English.  While  in  the  village  the  marriage 
of  an  Indian  couple  took  place,  which  to  me  wa^  a  new  and 
interesting  event  as  indeed  was  almost  every  thing  in  the 
village.    It  is  beautifully  situated  on  the  Grande  River. 

Tuesday  24th.  I  rode  to  Burford,  read  prayers  and  lectured 
in  the  school  house  ;  as  the  evening  was  very  wet,  I  had  but  a 
small  attendance,  and  after  the  sei-vice  I  went  with  Mr.  Smith, 
who  kindly  lodged  me  for  the  night.  He,  with  many  of  his 
neighbours,  is  very  anxious  to  have  a  small  Chiirch  erected,  and 
hope  to  enjoy  the  fixed  services  of  a  Missionary. 

Wednesday  25th.  I  rode  to  Simcoe,  and  slept  at  Mr. 
Keat's..  In  the  evening,  his  large  family  being  assembled,  I 
lectured  on  the  former  part  of  Psalm  Ixxxv.  I  have  received 
great  kindness  and  attentiou,  not  only  from  this  gentleman  and 
his  family,  but  from  all  the  other  families  round,  whenever  I 
visit  this  neighbourhood.  They  all  seem  very  anxious  for  the 
interests  and  efficiency  of  the  Church,  and  hope  to  see  both 
advanced,  through  the  labours  and  exertions  of  the  different 
labourers  in  the  vineyard  of  the  Lord. 

Thursday  26th.  I  rode  forward  to  Col.  Salmons,  who  with 
his  truly  pious  and  amiable  lady,  have  shown  me  no  small  kind- 
ness since  my  arrival  in  the  district — while  here  I  lectured 
morning  and  evening  from  the  Psalms. 

Friday  27th.  I  set  out  for  the  Lake  shore — but  being  obliged 
by  the  heavy  rain  to  stop  at  Mr.  Parke's — I  read  and  prayed  with 
the  family  there. 

Saturday  28th.  I  was  still  detained  by  the  storaiiness  of  the 
weather.

Sunday  29th.  Deinpr  anxious  to  keep  my  appointment,  I 
bravod  the  storm,  risin/^  very  enrly-^but  having  ridden  as  far  as 
Port  Dover — I  found  it  Avas  impossiblo  to  get  forward — owing  to 
the  great  rise  of  water  in  the  Creek  from  tne  rain  of  the  preced- 
ing days.  Unwilling  to  spend  the  Sabbath  unprofitably  to  myself 
and  others,  in  a  country  where  there  are  so  few  privileges  of 
Sabbath  services,  I  wished  a  few  of  the  neighbours,  as  many  us 
could  be  collected,  to  assemble  ;  but  I  regret  to  say  my  attempt 
failed,  partly  owing  to  the  want  of  general  notice,  partly  to  tlio 
unsettled  state  of  the  weather. 

Monday  3nth.  I  returned  to  Woodhouse,  stopping  by  tho 
way  again  at  tlie  house  of  Mr.  Park,  where  1  lectured  in  tlie 
evening  from  part  of  the  book  of  Job. 

Tuesday  31st.  I  lectured  morning  and  evening  and  answered 
many  questions  and  objections  to  infant  baptism,  which  were 
advanced  by  a  brother  of  a  Baptist  Minister  whom  I  happened 
to  meet  with  here.  It  is  very  necessary  that  every  missionary 
should  be  fully  made  up  upon  all  the  controverted  points,  that 
he  may  be  able  at  once  to  advance  scriptur.al  and  satisfactory 
replies,  and  oven  overthrow  others  who  hold  and  advance  op- 
posite views. 

JUNE. 
Saturday  4th.  I  left  Woodhouse  for  Burford,  and  on  my 
way  stopped  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdale.  The  family  being  as- 
sembled in  the  evening  I  lectured  on  part  of  the  2nd  chapter  of 
Job,  as  very  suitable  to  the  protracted  sufferings  of  Mr.  Tisdale. 
[  spoke  upon  the  nature  and  affliction  of  Job,  and  humbly  hojje 
that  the  words  spoken  in  weakness  were  brought  home  to  all 
hearts  by  the  influence  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 

Sunday  5th.  Rode  forward  to  the  school  liouse  in  Burford. 
A  large  class  of  adults  being  present  I  examined  them  in  tlie 
3rd  and  4th  chapter  of  Mark.  Some  efforts  have  been  made 
liere  to  establish  a  Sunday  school,  but  here,  as  elsewhere,  the 
want  of  a  proper  person  to  superintend  it  is  severely  felt.  It  ia 
the  great  difliculty  to  be  overcome,  and  I  fear  they  will  not  be 
successful.  Mr.  Carr,  the  catechist  at  Brandtford  has  arranged  to 
attend  here  every  alternate  Sunday,  but  being  obliged  to  take 
charge  of  a  school  there,  (as  the  salary,  £10  per  annum,  does  not 
allow  him  to  devote  his  time  exclusively  to  the  mission,)  his 
attendance  is  not  so  regular  as  must  be  desirable.  He  is  a  truly 
worthy  good  man,  and  one,  whom  I  trust,  to  be  a  lover  of  the 
work,  and  who  deems  it  a  privilege  to  be  allowed  to  labour  in 
the  vineyard.  I  read  morning  service  and  preached,  and  in  the 
evening  I  rode  to  the  Irish  Settlement,  where  I  found  a  large 
congregation  assembled  ;  I  read  evening  service  and  preached, 
but  I  regret  to  say  the  responses  were  feebly  made.  I  hope  soon 
to  hear  a  full  chorus  of  voices  in  making  the  responses,  not  only 
here,  but  in  all  my  congregations. 

Monday  6th.  I  visited  a  church  family,  and  a  few  friends 
being  in  attendance  I  read  and  expounded  a  psalm. 

Tuesday  7th.  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  in  the  school 
house  at  the  Irish  Settlement.  It  is  truly  gratifying  to  the 
missionary  to  perceive  how  cordially  he  is  everywhere  received, 

how  anxiously  his  next  visit  is  looked  for,  and  in  what  strong

and  influence,  to  direct  their  attention  to  the  spiritual  wants  of 
this  country,  ere  the  time  roll  on  when,  either  tlie  poor  emigrant 
sinks  down  into  indifference  to  the  means  of  grace  when  they 
may  bo  afforded  to  him,  or  connects  himself  with  those  who 
maintain  views  in  direct  variance  with  the  truth. 

Wednesday  8tli.  1  rode  to  the  Moore  Settlement,  nnd  in 
the  evening  read  prayers  and  preached  in  the  school  lu)use. 
Ik'fore  I  retired,  a  few  friends  being  assembled  at  the  house  cf 
Air.  Moore,  read  and  expounded  i)art  of  the  iv,  of  .fob. 

Thursday  {Hit.  In  the  morning  I  lectured  from  the  xxiii. 
Psalm.  All  ])resent  seemed  to  feel  tlie  interest  and  imi)ortanee 
of  the  great  salvation  ;  some  were  affected  even  to  tears.  May 
the  God  of  glory  and  Father  of  mercies  seal  with  Jlis  Holy 
Spirit  the  preaching  of  His  Word.  May  He  comfort  the  weak, 
and  convert  those  who  are  ignorant  of  the  truth  as  it  is  in  Jesus. 
I  then  rode  to  Springfield,  visited  some  members  of  the  Church, 
who  regretted  much  the  want  of  oj)i)ortunity  of  having  the 
ministrations  in  their  neighbourhood.  They  are  Emigrants 
from  Ireland,  and  had  been  settled  near  Troy,  in  the  United 
States,  for  some  yefirs.  With  the  hope  of  obtaining  land, 
they  removed  to  this  country,  but  one  of  them  exi)ress('(l, 
in  the  most  affecting  manner,  the  deep  sorrow  he  felt  for  ecm- 
senting  to  adopt  such  a  step  for  worldly  advantage,  as  they  were 
now  deprived  of  every  service  of  the  Church,  which  they  had 
enjoyed  in  their  former  Settlement.  In  the  evening  I  rode  on 
to  lirandtford,  and  lectured  in  the  house  of  Mr.  Kirby. 

Friday  10th.  Being  requested  by  the  Rev.  Mr.  Geddes,  of 
Hamilton,  to  preach  for  him  there  on  Sunday,  I  left  Brandtford 
for  this  purpose,  and  was  very  kindly  received  by  Mr.  Flock,  a 
member  of  the  Church. 

Saturday  1 1th.  IreadprayersandlecturedatMr.Flock'shouse. 

Sunday  12th.  Having  preached  at  Barton  Church  in  the 
morning  to  a  large  congregation,  I  then  walked  to  Hamilton,  to 
hold  evening  service ;  I  officiated  in  the  court  house,  and  had  a 
very  numerous  and  highly  respectable  assemblage.  In  the 
evening  I  lectured  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Bull,  and  then  returned 
to  Mr.  Flock's,  where  I  closed  the  day  by  singing  two  hymns, 
reading  part  of  a  chapter  and  by  prayer,  (lo  the  Hamilton 
Mission  the  Bishop  of  Quebec  gave  £25  in  1836,  Ed.) 

Mondtiy  13th.  In  the  morning  I  returned  and  lectured  at 
Mr.  Bull's  and  then  walked  to  Mr.  Hoffman's,  a  few  miles  distant 
and  lectured  from  one  of  the  Psalms. 

Wednesday  15th.  I  rode  to  Brandtford  on  my  way  back  to 
my  Mission,  and  lectured  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Kirby,  here  I  met 
the  Rev.  A  Nellis. 

Thursday  16th.  I  proceeded  to  Blomfield,  and  in  my  way 
stopped  at  Mr.  Tinley's,  and  after  a  short  rest,  went  on  to  the 
house  of  Mr.  De  Meys,  where  I  read  prayers  and  preached  to  a 
small  congregation.  After  sermon  I  lectured  on  the  baptismal 
service,  and  baptized  three  children. 

Friday  17th.  I  set  off  for  Middleton,  and  had  scarcely 
passed  through  the  long  woods,  (about  eleven  miles)  a  dreary

drive,  the  whole  one  vast  forost  of  pines,  and  no  vestififc  of  houso 
or  cultivation,  wlion  an  awful  and  terribly  subliuK!  thunder  storm 
eame  on.  The  friMjuent  and  vivid  fluHhes  of  forked  lightening, 
accompanied  by  lonj^  and  heavy  peals  of  thund(&gt;r,  Nurpasned  any 
thing  1  had  ever  se(!n  or  hoard.  This  storm  fully  realized  to  my 
mind  those  described  as  occurring  in  eastern  countries ;  it  con- 
tinued for  nearly  two  hours.  Tho  rain  fell  in  torrents  all  the 
time,  several  trees  were  struck  with  the  electric  fluid,  and  onf' 
quite  close  to  tho  house  at  which  1  had  found  shelter  from  tho 
pitiless  storm.  When  it  somewhat  abated,  I  proceeded  on  my 
jotirney  to  the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdalo,  where  I  was  kindly  taken 
in  for  the  night. 

Saturday  18th.  After  family  prayer  I  rode  to  Vienna,  my 
horse's  back  becoming  quite  sore  from  theronstant  friction  of  the 
saddle,  I  was  obliged  to  walk  nearly  the  whole  distance.  The 
•utense  heat  and  tho  sulphureous  vapours  with  which  the  wholo 
body  of  the  atmosphere  was  filled,  settling  on  the  waters  around 
me,  in  the  form  oi  a  yellow  scum,  rendered  my  journey  very 
fatiguing,  at  times  I  could  scarcely  breathe.  There  soon  followed, 
what  I  had  long  been  anticipating,  an  awful  and  tremendous 
storm.  The  wind  reminded  mo  of  a  Tornado ;  for  about  four  or 
five  minutes,  every  thing  seemed  to  be  swejjt  away  by  its  fury, 
trees  on  every  side  were  uprooted,  wMch  falling  with  a  dreadful 
crash,  added  not  a  little  to  this  terrific,  but  truly  sublime  scone ; 
the  rain  surpassed  every  thing  I  had  ever  belield  or  read  of. 
After  some  delay  I  proceeded  on  my  road,  which  lay  through  a 
wood,  and  found  much  difficulty  in  making  my  way  over  the 
trees  which  the  storm  had  thrown  across  the  track. 

Sunday  19th.  I  drove  from  Mr.  Draper's  to  keep  my  .ippoint- 
mont  ut  Vienna,  the  rain  decended  in  torrents  and  quickly  wetted 
mo  to  the  skin.  Having  succeeded  in  drying  my  clothes,  I  went 
to  the  school  house,  read  morning  service  and  preached,  of  course 
I  had  but  a  small  congi'egation  in  such  weather.  I  intended  to 
have  proceeded  to  a  second  service  at  Port  Burwell,  which  I  had 
also  appointed  for  the  evening,  this  however  was  totally  prevented 
by  the  continued  down  pouring  of  heavy  rain. 

Tuesday  2l8t.  1  visited  to  day  a  sick  member  of  the  Church, 
to  whom  I  read  a  Psalm,  with  remarks  suited  to  her  case,  and 
had  prayers  with  the  family. 

Wednesday  22nd.  I  went  out  to  another  scattered  family, 
performing  a  similar  service. 

Thursday  23rd.  J  rode  to  the  township  of  Middleton,  where 
I  I  ead  prayers  and  preached  to  a  small  congregation,  chiefly  con- 
sisting of  Baptists  and  Methodists. 

Saturday  25th.  I  proceeded  to  Simcoe,  the  day  was  boisterous 
and  unpleasant,  and  tlie  roads  very  heavy  in  consequence  of  the 
heavy  rains  which  had  fallen,  I  found  the  causeways  dangerous, 
being  deeply  covered  with  water,  and  was  obliged  to  let  the 
horse  pick  his  own  way,  and  get  over  them  as  well  as  he  could, 
for  I  could  not  see  what  parts  were  good  or  otherwise  ;  and  in 
many  places  I  was  obliged  to  leave  the  public  road  and  make  a 
circuit  in  the  wood  to  avoid  the  deep  holes.  Nothing  but  grace 
could  reconcile  the  mind  of  the  Missionary  to  such  dangerous 
and  arduous  journeys  daily.

From  Sunday  to  ThnrHday  I  was  oblijjfod  in  a  great  measure 
to  rest,  for  my  horse  was  ho  saddle  galled  with  the  constant  ser- 
vice, that  he  was  not  useable. 

Thui-sday  .*iOth.  I  therefore  walked  to  Col.  Salmon's,  and  in 
the  evening  lectured  from  the  I'salms. 

JULY. 

Saturday  2nd.  T  again  took  my  horse  and  sot  off  on  my 
journey  to  JJurford,  on  my  way  I  called  at  a  Mrs.  Force's,  in  the 
township  of  Windham,  and  having  assembled  the  several  inmates* 
of  the  family,  I  ex])lained  a  portion  of  the  scripture. 

Sunday  Mrd,  1  rode  forward  to  llurford  early,  visited  the 
Sunday  school  recently  established,  and  examined  the  children 
in  the  l4thChap.  of  St.  Mark.  Having  closed  the  school  1  com- 
menced the  morning  service  and  preached  from  Phil.  iv.  "  H&lt;'- 
joice."  Shortly  after  morning  service  I  rode  to  the  Irish  settle- 
ment, where  1  read  the  evening  service  and  j)reached  from  the 
parable  of  the  publican  ;  and  immediately  after  service,  I  rode 
about  six  miles  further  to  officiate  a  third  time  at  Springfield. 
My  congregation  was  composed  of  English,  Irish,  and  Oanadianis, 
many  of  them  members  attached  to  the  Church  ;  I  preached 
from  the  text — "  Whoso  shall  confess  me  before  men,  &amp;c."  As 
soon  as  the  congregation  had  retired  some  very  profitable  con- 
versation arose,  and  many  questions  were  asked  me  relativi-  to 
Church  government,  the  ritual  of  the  Church,  &amp;c.  I  jierceive 
that  many  of  those  who  are  uoav  connected  with  Dissenters,  have 
joined  that  connection  from  necessity  ;  they  were  originally  at- 
tached to  the  ordnances  of  the  Church,  and  the  same  pious  feeling 
which  produced  that  attachment,  made  them  feel  more  deei)ly 
the  entire  absence  of  her  religious  ministrations,  and  led  naturally 
to  this  result — but  I  will  venture  to  assert,  th.atmany  of  them,  if 
they  could  calculate  with  certainty  upon  the  regular  attendance 
of  a  Clergyman,  would  soon  return  to  their  ancient  fold.  At 
night  I  read  a  Psalm,  made  some  few  remarks  upon  it,  and  closed 
the  day  with  family  worship. 

Monday  4th.  I  rode  to  Mount  Pleasant,  and  in  iny  route 
visited  a  Church  family,  having  called  at  a  house  in  the  '.illage 
upon  some  business,  the  master  as  soon  as  he  learned  who  I  was, 
came  out  himself  and  warmly  invited  me  to  alight,  and  spend  the 
evening  with  them.  As  I  had  no  appointment  for  that  night,  i 
accepted  an  invitation  so  warmly  given,  he  told  me  that  lie  had 
come  from  Pensylvania  nearly  40  years  back  and  was  then  a 
member  of  the  Church,  but  having  not  the  remotest  prospect  of 
ever  enjoying  the  services  of  Clergymen  of  that  Church  here,  he 
and  his  family  had  joined  the  Methodists.  Having  read  a  l*salm 
and  made  a  few  remarks  upon  it,  after  prayers  he  told  me  his 
wife  was  favourable  to  the  Mormonites,  who  have  lately  com-

all  warmly,  and  I  NJnccrcly  hope;  faithfully.  Homo  tinu&gt;  pre* 
vious  to  my  departure,  my  frii'ud  r&lt;&gt;(pu'.sted  me,  as  soon  as  I 
could  coiiveuieutly,  a^aiu  to  visit  this  neii^hhourhood,  for  that 
the  place  was  ho  distracte*!  wuh  the  conihctin;^  opinions  of  so 
many  various  pi-eachers,  that  ho  ct)nsiilered  it  a  ;j;ood  opeuin^% 
und(u*  the  Divine  Idessin;^',  for  introducing'  tins  njore  solemn 
services  of  the  (Jliurch.  As  this  ncdffhhourhood  is  situate&lt;l  in  tho 
London  district,  T  ])romisod  as  often  as  I  travelled  in  those  parts 
adjoinin;,'  his  SettlenuMit,  I  would  endeavour  to  f^ive  him  acall. 

Ho  then  remarked,  Mrs. has  f,dven  more  of  her  attention 

to  your  opinions  this  mornin/j;,  than  to  those  of  any  othor  per- 
sons whatever,  who  have  visited  her.  Oh!  ^Sir,  you  know  not 
how  it  ;,'rieves  mo  to  soo  her  now  hnl  away  hy  such  stran|j;o  and 
unHci'i|)tural  notions.  I  thou  rode  to  the  Mooro  Settlement 
in  llurford,  visited  a  Chiircli  fanuly  in  tho  evening,  and 
then  walked  to  tho  Irish  Settlement  to  keep  an  appointment, 
wluMo  I  bapt  zed  a  child,  and  closed  tho  day  with  reading'  and 
prayer. 

Wednesday  7th.  I  returned  afj^ain  to  tho  &gt;[ooro  Settlement, 
called  upon  a  Church  family,  one  of  tlu;  members  of  whicli  had 
l)een  very  ill,  aiul  in  the  eveniuf|  I  read  prayers  and  preached 
in  tho  scliool  house. 

Thursdiy  Hth.  I  rode  to  Norwich,  a  lon&lt;i;  and  dreary  ride, 
in  which  I  e.\]»erit.MU'ed  "i^reat  difficulty  in  nmkin&lt;j;  my  way 
through  the  piuo  woods.  I  suH'ered  much  inconvenienco  and 
nuiny  privations  in  this  journey,  and  realized  the  diflicnlties  of  a 
Mi'^sionaiy  life  :  but  tho  Lord  is  the  stren;^th  and  stay  of  his 
j)eople.  I  did  not  find  so  many  Church  families  in  this  part  of 
the  district  as  I  was  led  to  expect  ;  but  few  as  they  are,  surely 
they  ou&lt;;ht  not  to  be  f()rf»'otton.  "  Ah  Sir  !"  said  tho  mother  of  a 
larijo  family,  "horo  we  havo  no  Church,  no  Minister,  no  Sunday- 
"  school,  no  Tracts  ;  our  children  know  not  when  it  is  Sunday." 
To  a  few  assembled  in  tho  oveninjiif  I  explained  a  portion  of 
Scrij)ture,  and  closed  the  day  with  prayer. 

Friday  f)th.  I  1)aptizeil  a  child.  Previous  to  the  commence- 
ment of  my  journey,  th&lt;:  father  of  tho  child  asked  mo  wliothcr 
tho  baptism  of  a  dau&lt;&gt;hto.-,  who  seems  to  havo  been  baptized  by 
a  Dissentin*;'  ISfinister,  av.is  valid  ?  Leaving  tho  question  to 
himself,  I  declined  re-baptizing  tho  child,  unles  ho  was  prepared 
to  say  that  she  was  not  already  baptized,  I  then  rode  to 
Middleton,  through  a  dreary  pine  wood,  wdiich  seemed  in  some 
places  to  shut  out  almost  every  ray  of  light.  I  preached  in  tho 
school  house  on  the  Talbot  Street,  and  i)assod  tne  night  at  tho 
Imuse  of  a  member  of  tho  Methodist  Connexion,  where  1  read 
and  expounded  in  the  evening. 

Saturday  10th.  I  rode  forward  to  Vienna,  in  the  townshij) 
of  Bayham.  On  my  road  I  visited  some  scattered  families,  and 
passed  tho  night  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Draper,  closing  the  day

to  hold  tlie  service  in  the  wehool  house  there.  The  eonj;re;ration

returned  in  the  evening  to  Vienna. 

TuoMibiy  IJIth.  I  went  forward  to  Mi(blloton,  and  visited  a 
Chureh  family  by  the  way.  I  afterwanls  stopped  at  the  house 
of  Mr.  Htandinifs.  'J'ho  old  lady  of  the  Iiouho  made  a  very

that  home  associations  were  not  forj,'otten  after  an  absenct  of 
twenty  years,  viz.,  that  I  should  bury  her,  if  1  survived  her, 
and  was  in  the  neif^hbourhood,  with  vn/  »iirjilki\ 

Wednesday  14th.  1  preached  in  the  school  house  at  Middle- 
ton,  but  had  only  n  small  congremition. 

Thursday  15th.  I  proceeded  to  Woodlioi'so,  visited  a 
Church  family  on  my  road,  I  arrived  at  the  Rectory  in  the 
evoninpf,  and  was,  as  usual,  most  warmly  and  afl'ectionately 
received. 

Saturday  ICth.  I  examined  a  class  of  children  to-day  in  the 
first  six  chai)ters  of  8t.  John.  They  answered  remarkably  well, 
evincinjif  careful  reading  on  the  part  of  the  children,  as  well  as 
attention  and  care  in  tlieir  teacher,  Mrs.  Evans. 

bunday  17th.  I  rode  to  Dover,  where  I  officiated  in  the 
evening,  not  being  able  to  get  on  to  Walpole,  in  consequence  of 
the  bad  state  of  the  roads. 

Wednesday  20th.  Accompanied  by  my  kind  friend  Mr. 
Evans,  I  v.nis  obliged  to  set  uff  .T,gain  early  the  next  day. 

Thursday  21st.  We  proceeded  to  lirandtford,  but  not  being 
able  to  accomplish  it  in  one  long  drive,  we  were  necessitated  to  go 
to  Hamilton.  After  our  arrival  at  Mr.  HolFman's,  Mr.  Evans  read 
a  portion  from  Tunothy,  and  expounded  :  I  took  the  prayers. 

Friday  22nd.  We  returned  to  Woodhouse,  a  long  and 
dreary  drive  of  nearly  fiftv  miles. 

Saturday  23rd.  I  left  Woodhouse  for  Burford,  but  being 
caught  by  a  tremendous  thunder  storm,  I  was  obliged  to  stop  at 
Windham,  and  on 

Sunday  24th,  I  set  off  again  at  an  early  hour  to  keep  my 
appointment  at  Bur*brd,  where  I  officiated  in  the  morning  at 
the  school  house,  and  then  proceeded  to  the  Irish  Settlement.  I 
was  much  pleased  to  find  a  very  large  congregation  in  attend- 
ance. After  the  service  I  again  left  this  place  for  Blomfield, 
to  hold  a  third  service  there.  I  read  prayers  and  lectured  upon 
the  Church  service,  and  preached.  There  wore  many  Dissenters 
present,  who  seemed  to  listen  with  great  attention. 

Monday  25th.  I  rode  back  to  Woodhouse,  distance  twenty- 
five  miles. 

Tuesday  26th.  Accompanied  by  Mr.  Evans  I  visited  a 
church  family  in  that  township.

Wedncsdfvy  27tli.  I  again  left  Woodhouso  to  go  to  Norwich 
and  rouehed  Muldleton. 

Tliursday  2Hth.  I  left  Middlcton  foi  Norwich,  where  I  road 
prayerH  aud  lectured  upon  the  Cluirch  service  and  preacheu. 
My  congre^^ation  as.semblod  in  a  lai-;;e  room,  and  consisted  of  all 
sorts,  Methodists,  Quakers,  and  two  llonian  Catholics.  I  was 
invited  by  a  Quebec  la('  to  spend  the  eveninp^  at  her  house,  1 
held  a  long  and  iutereslmg  conversation  with  her.  I  was  told 
here  that  one  person  l)eirg  invited  to  come  and  hear  the  Church 
minister  replied,  "  Wiiat  use  is  there  for  me  to  go  and  l&gt;car  him 
read  a  sermon  ?  I  can  do  that  for  myself  at  home."  She  was, 
however,  persuaded  to  attend,  and  1  afterwards  heard  she  was 
somewhat  astonished  when  she  heard  me  preach,  however 
weakly,  I  trust  faithfully,  without  my  papers.  TJio  idea  of  a 
missronary  of  the  Cliuven  travelling  about  in  the  back  and  re- 
mote parts  of  the  differv^nt  townships,  seems  to  he  a  source  of 
great  and  unmixed  satisfaction  to  tl'e  poor  emigrants,  Avho  can 
now  calculate  upon  tlie  visits  of  his  minister  periodically,  aud 
enjoy  the  ordinar.jes  of  the  Church. 

Friday  2!)tli.  I  rode  back  to  INliddleton,  and  stopping  at  the 
house  of  Mr.  Tisdale,  I  read  aud  explained  a  psalm-  with  prayer, 
to  his  fanr'; . 

Saturday  30th.  Having  previously  read  part  of  the  119th 
Psalm,  I  left  for  W.»nna.  On  my  road  I  visited  a  lamily  from 
England,  a  long  time  resident  in  this  country.  I  then  pro- 
ceeded to  the  house  of  ISIr.  Draper,  where  having  assembled  his 
friends  I  read  and  lectured. 

Sunday  31st.  I  went  to  Port  Burwell  and  read  prayers  and 
pre.tched  in  the  Church  there.  I  had  a  very  large  congregation. 
After  service  I  n  turned  again  to  Vienna  to  hold  the  evening 
service.  After  prayerr,  and  preaching  I  delivered  a  short  lec- 
ture on  baptism,  and  then  baptized  the  child  of  a  member  of  the 
Scotch  Church.    These  services  over  1  married  a  coir.  le. 

--'   ■•'        •  AUGUST.  '*.  .' 

Monday  1st.  I  rode  a  short  distance  and  baptized  three 
children  of  a  family  from  Nova  Scotia,  who  expressed  the  heart- 
felt pleasure  experienced  by  the  baptism  of  their  children  ;  they 
repeatedly  expressed  their  gi'atitude,  and  requested  I  would  call 
to  see  them  whenevsr  I  could. 

Tuesday  2nd.  I  visited  a  family  from  Scotland,  who  in  the 
absence  of  the  ministers  of  the  Kirk,  give  i  decided  preferenc  i 
to  the  Established  Church.    In  the  evening  I  read  and  lectui'ed. 

Wednesday  3rd.  1  proceeded  to  Middleton  and  preached  in 
the  school  house  to  a  small  congregation.  i&gt;uruig  the  service 
my  voice  at  times  could  scarcely  be  heard,  in  consequence  of 
'  !:e  loud  peals  of  thunder,  wiiich  for  many  minutes  followed  in 
quick  succession,  accoiiipanied  with  heavy  showers  of  hail,  and 
rain,  and  wind. 

Thursday  4th.  I  rode  back  to  the  township  of  Woodhouse, 
about  twenty-two  miles. 

Friday  5th.  I  walked  from  the  neighbourhood  of  Simcoe  to 
Walpole,  a  distance  of  fifteen  miles.  I  wa'^  prevented  from  at-

and  met  with  a  most  kiiid  reception. 

Sunday  7th.  1  read  jjiayers  and  preached  in  the  school 
liouse,  baptized  seven  children,  and  boinj^  invited  to  spend  the

blod  several  mem'^ers  oi  tlie  Kirk,  to  whom  I  lectured  from 
Pwalm  1st. 

Monday  f  th.  I  walLvjd  to  Woodhouse,  passing  the  evening 
at  the  house  jf  Mr.s.  I'arkj  a  Canadian  lady,  much  attached  to 
the  Church. 

Tuesdav  and  Wednesdav,  Dth  and  Kith.  I  suffered  the 
most  excruciating  pain  m  my  iiead,  the  whole  side  of  my  faco 
inflamed,  and  was  confined  to  my  bed. 

Thursday  llth.  The  j)ain  rather  alleviated  to-day. 

Saturday  13tli.  1  rode  to  the  townsliip  of  liurford,  and  slept 
at  Mr.  jSIoore's. 

Sunday  14th.  I  officiated  in  the  morning  at  the  school  house, 
and  immediately  after  service  rode  to  tlie  Irish  Settlement, 
where  I  read  the  evening  service  and  preached,  and  then  pro- 
ceeded for  the  third  service  at  Blomiv'ld,  after  which  1  baptized 
a  child  ;  and  as  might  bo  expected,  was  very  much  fatigued  and 
worn  out- 
Monday  loth.  I  rode  back  to  Burford,  visited  a  church 
family  in  my  route  and  slept  at  Mr.  JMoore's. 

Tuesday  lOth.  1  returned  again  to  Woodhouse  for  rest. 

Thursday  Ultli.  1  set  off  this  morning  for  Norwich,  and  was 
overtaken  by  a  tremendous  storm  of  rain  It  fell  so  heavily  that 
I  was  obliged  to  take  shelter  in  a  slied.  As  the  continued  rain 
prevented  my  keeping  my  appointment,  I  changed  the  plan  of 
my  route  and  rode  to  Aliddleton,  where  1  was  to  iiold  an  appoint- 
ment the  following  day.     I  slept    t  the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdalc. 

Fridty  lUth.  I  preached  in  tiie  school-house,  the  congrega- 
tion was  not  large  as  the  farm  ;rs  were  busily  engaged  in  harves 
but  I  was  infonued  if  service  v-ould  be  held  at  tliat  time  on  the 
Sundays,  a  very  crowded  attenaouce  might  be  expected. 

Saturday  20th.  I  ^ode  to  Yieniia  and  remained  at  the  house 
of  Mr.  Wright,  where  I  closed  the  day  by  reading  and  lecturing 
from  a  portion  of  sciipture.  I  hope  some  good  nmy  arise  iiortt 
this  pi  ni  of  reading  and  explaining  the  book  of  Holy  Writ  in  the 
different  houses,  if  a  missionary  had  no  opportunity  of  public 
preaching,  merely  as  a  scripture  reader  niuch,  under  the  Divine 
blessing,  would  be  tlie  profit  attending  his  service. 

Sunday  21st.  Mr.  Wright  drove  me  to  Port  Burwell,  whev  j 
I  officiated  in  the  Church.  A  very  large  congregation  attended. 
In  the  evening  I  read  prayers  and  preached  at  Vienna,  and  had 
also  the  satisfaction  of  a  full  attendance. 

Monday  22nd.  T  set  out  for  Middleton,  in  the  way  I  entered 
into  conversation  with  a  man,  appearing  to  be  di-unk.  I  admo- 
nished him  of  the  sinfulness  of  his  life.  Although  intoxicated 
he  had  sense  enough  to  acknowledge  the  justness  of  my  remarks. , 
May  the  Lord  open  the  eyes  of  his  understanding,  that  he  may 
see  and  live.

Tuesday  23rd,  I  rode  to  Mount  Pleasant  a  long  and  tiresome 
ride,  I  stopped  at  a  tavern,  where  the  mistress  of  the  house 
learning  I  \mw»  a  clergyman,  refused  to  take  more  than  half  price 
for  each  article  sui)plied  to  myself  and  for  my  horse.  Will  any 
one  tell  me  these  poor  emigrants  do  not  both  desire  and  deserve 
the  services  of  the  christian  ministry  ? 

Wednesday  24th.  I  rode  to  liurford,  visiting  in  my  way  a 
church  family. 

Thursday  25th.  I  visited  another  family  in  the  neighbour- 
hood, they  were  Canadians  and  very  attached  membery  of  the 
church. 

Friday  26th.  I  set  out  for  Woodhouse  in  my  way  to  Wal- 
pole,  rode  about  twenty  miles  and  was  kindly  received  at  the 
house  of  my  valued  friend,  Mr.  Evans. 

Saturday  27th.  I  proceetled  to  Mr.  Park's,  near  the  Lake, 
and  iu  the  evening  lectured  at  his  house,  where  I  met  a  most 
cordial  reception. 

Sunday  28th.  I  proceeded  to  Wal])ole  where  I  preached  in 
the  school  house.  There  are  a  few  English  families  in  the 
neighbourhood  extremely  anxious  to  secure  the  services  of  a 
resident  clergyman,  but  tlieir  limited  means  do  not  allow  them 
for  a  moment  to  expect  it  at  present.  One  of  them  remarked  to 
This  is  fine  place  for  poor,  but  industrious  men,  if  v  e

only  had  churches,  ministers  and  schools."    May  the  Lord  soo' 
hasten  the  fulfilment  of  their  prayer. 

Alonday  2!)th.  I  returned  to  Woodhouse,  and  in  the  'a} 
visited  a  member  of  the  church,  who  was  very  ill.  Having  read 
the  23d  Psalm,  and  commented  upon  what  I  read,  I  commended 
her  in  prayei'  to  Him  who  has  piomised  to  hear  and  answer  the 
prayers  of  his  people.  The  word  appeared  to  come  home  to  her 
lieart  w  ith  power,  may  the  Lord  grant  her  patience  under  her 
sufferings,  and  a  happy  issue  out  of  all  her  afflictions. 

SEPTEMBER. 

Wednesday  1st.  I  rode  to  Victoria  and  was  very  kindly 
received  by  Mr.  Tisdale ;  in  the  evening  I  lectured  to  a  small 
congragation  from  one  of  the  Psalms,  some  very  interesting  and 
I  trust  profitable  conversation  ensued,  upon  subjects  connected 
with  the  church,  respecting  the  hopes  of  the  christian  and  our 
sufferings  as  pilgrims.  May  we  all  be  found  in  the  ways  of  the 
Lord,  and  finally  accepted  in  the  beloved. 

Sunday  4th.  Mr.  Evans  having  kindly  exchanged  duties 
with  me,  1  officiated  to  day  in  the  church  at  Woodhouse,  I 
examined  the  children  of  the  Sunday  school,  and  delivered  a 
short  and  simple  address  to  them  previous  a  a  distribution  of 
books  for  their  proficiency  in  the  scriptures,  and  their  regular 
attendance.  Tn  the  evening  I  read  prayers  and  preached  iu  the 
school  house  at  Senicor,  as  tlie  rain  fell  in  torrents,  the  con- 
gregation was  very  small,  and  afterwards  I  returned  to  Mr. 
Evans. 

Wednesday  8th.  I  rode  to  the  house  of  Mr.  Keets,  a  gentle- 
man from  Bristol,  warmly  attached  to  the  Church.  In  the  even- 
ing I  read  and  expounded — all  seemed  to  listen  with  deep  attention

Thursday  9th.  I  rode  to  the  township  of  Norwich  and  stopped 
at  the  house  of  Mr.  Addi«&lt;on  ;  having  gathered  togetiier  his  very 
large  household,  I  delivered  a  short  lecture. 

Friday  10th.  Leaving  the  house  of  Mr.  Addison,  I  proceeded 
to  the  school  house,  a  short  distance  from  his  residence,  and 
preached  at  ten  o'clock  to  a  small  congrei^ation.  Immediately 
after  this  service,  I  set  out  for  the  townsliip  of  Middleton,  having 
an  appointment  at  four  o'clock.  After  jjrayer  and  preaching  1 
accompanied  Mr.  Tisdale,  who  has  shewn  me  the  most  uniform 
kindness,  since  the  first  commencement  of  my  Mission,  and  has 
expressed  hims&lt;;lf  extremely  anxious  for  the  success  of  our 
Missionary  cause. 

Saturday  llth.  I  set  out  for  Vienna,  and  being  caught  by  a 
very  heavy  storm  of  rain,  I  was  compelled  to  discontinue  my 
journey.  I  stopped  at  tli .  house  of  Mr.  Standing,  from  England, 
he  is  a  Congregationali ';t,  but  in  the  absence  of  any  Minister  of 
his  own  persuasion,  gives  a  decided  preference  to  tlie  Church. 

Sunday  I2th.  As  my  appointment  for  Port  Burwell  was  at 
eleven  o'clock,  and  I  had  to  ride  a  ditance  of  nineteen  iiiilcs,  I 
was  obliged  to  set  oft'  extremely  early.  I  otHciated  as  usual  in 
the  Church,  and  after  service  accompanied  Mr.  Wri;^ht  to  V^ienna, 
where  I  read  prayers  and  preached  to  a  very  large  congregation 
of  English  and  Irish  members  of  the  Church ;  some  Aletliodists 
also  attended. 

Tuesday  14tli.  I  visited  a  family  from  Scotland  who  have 
declared  themselves  very  frie'idly  to  the  Church.  In  the  evening 
I  lectured  at  this  house.  I  am  rejoiced  to  see  a  growing  interest 
for  tlie  Mission  appears  ahnost  daily. 

Wednesday  loth.  I  rode  to  JMr.  Draper's,  at  Vienna,  in  Bay- 
ham,  and  having  left  my  horse  there,  1  walked  to  tlie  house  of 
Mr.  Ault,  where  I  lectured  on  the  baptismal  service,  and  baptized 
a  little  boy.  Mr.  Ault  regretted  Avitli  much  feeling,  the  absence 
of  SaLb-ith  services,  the  want  of  Sunday  schools,  and  that  Sundays 
now  passed  away  very  dift'erently  from  tlie  manner  of  their  being 
kept  in  tlie  highly  favoured  land  of  England.  Oh  that  a  voice 
from  this  land  of  our  adoption  could  reach  the  hearts  of  our 
friends,  our  relations,  and  our  connections,  at  the  other  side  of 
(he  Atlantic, and  enlist  their  sympathies  in  her  favour,  that  some 
r"ore  vigorous  effiirts  toameliorate  our  spiritual  destitution  would 
^  J  adojjted !  Alas  how  wide  is  the  field,  and  how  ripe  the  harvest, 
)i&gt;t  how  f(yw,  how  deplorably  few,  the  labourers! 

Thursday  16th.  I  proceeded  to  Middleton  and  stopped  at 
the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdale.  In  the  evening  I  read  and  explained 
some  portions  of  sciipturo.  The  more  frequently  I  visit  this 
family,  the  more  I  am  pleased  with  them  ;  a  love  of  the  tnith,  as 
it  is  in  Jesus,  appears  strengthening. 

Friday  17th.  I  rode  to  the  township  of  Woodhouse,  and  was 
kindly  received  by  the  family  of  Mr.  Salmon,  Mr.  S.  having 
assembled  thy  members  of  his  household  iuthe  evening,  I  lectured 
to  them. 

Sunday  19th.  I  proceeded  to  V^alpole,  my  ride  being  for 
the  most  part  along  the  Lake  shore,  I  was  obliged  to  travel  slowly,

i- 


the  sand  not  affording  anytliinpf  like  a  solid  road,  but  yioldinp  at 
every  step  of  the  liorHO,  rendered  my  journey  teuious  ;  conscious 
of  the  gi-eat  satisfaction  my  visit  would  give  I  proceeded  however 
with  a  cheerful  heart.  I  read  the  morning  service  and  preached 
in  the  school  house,  my  morning  congregation  chieHy  Scotch.  It 
is  deeply  to  be  deplored  how  soon  the  poor  Emigrant  in  the 
absence  of  any  siated  Mementor,  forgets  how  theHabbath  ouglit 
to  be  passed,  and  falls  quickly  and  generally  into  the  loose  habits 
of  his  American  neighbours,  many  of  whom  ai)pear  entirely  to 
disregard  the  sacredness  of  that  day  which  the  Lord  Jehovah 
liallowed.  While  preaching  I  was  grieved  to  liear  'i.he  report  of 
a  gun,  and  the  sound  of  the  axe,  anu  could  not  but  speak  strongly 
in  my  sermon  of  the  sinfulness  of  such  awful  desecration  of  tlie 
Lord's  day.  After  service  here,  I  rode  to  the  Irish  settlement, 
read  evening  prayers  and  preached.  My  visits  to  this  place  ap- 
pear to  afford  unmixed  pleasure,  and  they  all  look  forward  with 
joy,  in  the  hope  of  receiving  mv  occasional  visits,  so  long  as  I 
remain  in  the  neighbourhood.  The  families  settled  in  this  placo 
were  all  originally  members  of  the  Church,  but  in  the  absence  of 
her  ministrations  joined  themselves  to  the  Methodists,  but  as  the 
Preachi  t  of  that  connection  have  of  late  ceased  to  visit  them, 
they  we  :  \  to  themselves,  presenting  an  open  field  to  any 
Mormoniit  Jniversalist,  or  ISocinian,  or  fanatic  teacher,  who 
might  be  wiiLug  to  offer  his  services.  After  otiiciating  here,  I 
proceeded  to  Dover,  where  I  lectured  in  the  evening  at  the  house 
of  Mr.  M'Coy. 

Wednesday  20th.  I  again  rode  to  Dover,  and  lectured  from 
one  of  the  Psalms.  I  stopped  for  the  night  at  Mr.  M'Coy's,  who 
is  very  favourable  to  the  Church,  and  feels  anxious  for  the 
success  of  it  in  this  country. 

Thursday  21st.  I  rode  to  the  house  of  my  always  kind 
friend,  Mr.  Evans. 

Friday  22nd.  I  set  out  again  for  Simcoe,  where  I  lectured 
in  the  evening  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Salmon. 

Saturday  23rd.  I  again  left  Simcoe  to  proceed  to  the  town- 
ship of  Burford.  The  roads  were  very  deep  and  heavy  in 
consequence  of  the  heavy  rains.  What  could  sustain  the  mind 
under  the  privations  and  difficulties  to  be  encountered  by  the 
Travelling  Missionary,  but  the  love  of  Christ,  the  grace  of 
Christ,  and  the  command  of  Clirist,  "  Go  ye  unto  all  nations, 
and  preach  the  Gospel  to  eveiy  creature" !  Shall  we  neglect 
our  own  people,  and  expect  to  escape  reproof  ? 

Sunday  24th.  I  met  the  Rev.  Mr.  Graham  at  the  school 
house  this  morning  ;  he  read  the  prayers  and  preached.  He 
then  rode  with  me  to  the  Irish  Settlement ;  I  read  the  evening 
service  and  preached.  After  service  a  child  was  presented  for 
baptism,  I  delivered  therefore  a  short  lecture  on  that  rite.  The 
congregation  was  very  large,  and  the  responses  were  made 
solemnly  and  distinctly.    The  singing  particularly  good. 

Monday  25.  I  rode  to  the  township  of  Norwich,  and  stopped 
at  the  house  of  Mr  Davis,  who  repeatedly  expressed  his  thank- 
fulness to  the  Almighty,  that  he  had  been  allowed  again  to 
see  a  Clergyman  of  his  own  Church  under  his  own  roof,  and 
hopes  now  the  Lord  may  spare  him  to  see  a  Church  built  iu  the

having  assembled  his  very  largo  family  and  a  few  friends,  1 
lectured  to  them.  They  all  ajipcared  to  feel  the  solemnity  of 
the  time. 

Tuesday  26th.  I  read  prayers  and  preached  to  a  largo 
congregation  of  a  very  mixed  composition,  Methodists,  Baptists, 
Quakers,  and  Church  people.  I  lectured  therefore  upon  the 
Church  service,  and  afterwards  baptized  a  child. 

Wednesday  27th,  I  rode  to  Norwich-villa,  and  visited  a 
family  of  the  name  of  Houseman. 

Thursday  28th.  I  proceeded  to  the  lower  Settlement  of 
Norwich,  and  preached  in  the  school-house.  Congregation  not 
large.  My  route  this  day  very  dull  and  dreary,  and  from  the 
wetness  of  the  late  weather  travelling  had  become  very  unplea- 
sant.   I  lectured  in  the  evening  at  Mr.  Addison's. 

Friday  20th.  I  proceeded  to  Frederickburgh,  in  the  tovm- 
sliip  of  Middleton,  where  I  read  the  evening  service,  and  preached 
in  the  school-house.  I  lectured  upon  the  Church  service.  My 
congregation,  many  of  whom  were  Baptists,  seemed  to  be  much 
interested,  and  very  attentive. 

Saturday  30th.  I  rode  to  Simcoe,  and  married  a  couple  by 
license. 

OCTOBER. 
Sunday  2d.     I  rode  to  Windham,  where  I  read  prayers  and 
preached  in  the  school-house,  to  a  very  large  congregation. 

Monday  3d.  I  visited  a  few  scattered  families  this  day,  and 
prayed  with  two  sick  persons,  and  returned  to  Simcoe  at  night. 

Tuesday  4th.  I  went  to  Down  to  preach ;  as  the  rain  poured 
down  heavily  no  persons  assembled,  apprehending  I  could  not 
attend.  In  the  evening  I  read  the  Scriptures  and  commented 
upon  the  passages  to  a  few  friends. 

Wednesday  5th.     I  returned  to  Woodhouse. 

Friday  7th.  I  rode  to  Middleton,  and  in  the  evening  lec- 
tured at  the  house  of  Mr.  Tisdale. 

Sunday  8th.  I  rode  to  Vienna,  and  in  my  way  was  accosted 
by  a  stranger,  who  enquired  the  particulars  of  my  mission.  He 
described  himself  as  an  attached  member  of  the  Church,  and 
told  me,  if  it  were  possible  to  get  a  Church  built  in  his  neigh- 
bourhood, he  was  very  willing  to  subscribe  for  himself  and  his 
brother-in-law,  25  dollars.  Having  conversed  a  long  time  with 
him,  at  my  departure  ho  begged  my  acceptance  of  the  sum  of 
cue  dollar,  to  be  user*  by  me  in  any  way  I  might  consider  best 
in  furtherance  of  the  cause  of  the  mission.  Although  it  was  so 
small  a  sum,  it  was  so  freely  offered  and  in  so  kind  a  spirit,  that 
I  promised  to  comply  with  his  wishes.  If  such  a  spirit  can  be 
brought  about  extensivelv  amongrt  the  members  of  the  Church 
here  and  at  home,  who  nave  the  n^eans,  how  soon,  how  very 
soon,  under  the  Divine  blessing,  might  we  hope  to  see  things 
appearing  under  a  very  different  light. 

Sunday  9th.  I  drove  to  Port  Burwell,  and  officiated  to  a 
very  large  congregation  ;  and  after  service  returned  to  Vienna, 
where  I  read  the  evening  service  and  preached  in  the  school 
house.

Monday  10th.  I  visited  several  families,  and  spoke  to  them 
of  the  thinufs  of  God  :  may  the  Lord  accept  our  labours  and  bless 
our  councils.  In  thooveninc;  I  lectured  in  the  house  of  a  family 
from  tlic  United  States.  Althoun;h  some  of  the  family  are  favour- 
able to  Motlioflisni,  I  am  quite  sure,  were  rep;ular  services  of 
tlie  Church  establisljod  in  the  nei^libourhood,  not  only  the 
member.i  of  this  house,  but  of  many  others,  would  ffladly  decide 
in  our  favour.  God  fjraut,  to  M-liatsoever  branch  of  Clirist's 
church  on  earth  tiicy  bolon:,',  thoy  may  all  bo  accepted  in  the 
church  above,  and  all  may  live  here  as  Christians  indeed.  In 
the  cveninnr  a  note  was  ^iven  to  me  by  a  ])erson  who  had  ridden 
twent^'-four  miles,  to  request  me  to  attend  a  funeral,  to  read  the 
funeral  service  and  to  preach  a  funeral  sermon  next  day. 

Tuesday  11th.  I  sot  off'  in  consequence  to  ride  the  twenty- 
four  miles  to  Windliam.  Ilavinj?  arrived  about  one  o'clock, 
previous  to  the  service,  I  read  prayer  and  preached  a  sermon  in 
the  scliool-house.  Many  liad  come  eip^ht  or  ten  miles  to  attend. 
I  find  that  as  many  attend  fuiiorals  in  tliis  country,  to  hear  tlia 
sermon  of  tlie  minister,  where  one  can  be  gotten,  as  come  from 
respect  to  the  family  of  the  deceased. 

Wednesday  12th.  I  rode  to  Middleton,  and  preached  at 
Mr.  Tisdale's  to  but  a  small  congregation,  though  a  very  atten- 
tive one  :  it  consisted  of  Methodists,  Ba])tists,  and  Church 
people.  A  growing  interest  towards  the  Church  is  very  per- 
ceptible in  this  place,  tand  were  it  possible  to  locate  a  faithful 
Minister  in  tlie  adjoining  township  of  Bnyliam,  I  have  no  doubt 
that  very  quiclcly  a  good  congregation  wotild  be  gathered  here 
and  in  other  places,  affV)rding  time  and  opportunity  to  the 
members  of  the  diff'erent  classes  to  judge  of  the  purity,  faithful- 
ness, and  Scriptural  character  of  our  venerable  liturgy. 

TJiursday  I'Mh.  I  rode  to  Windham  ;  the  roads  were 
deep,  and  the  travelling  very  disagreeable,  from  the  incessant 
rains.  Owing  to  the  heavy  storm  of  wind  and  rain,  no  person 
came  out  to  the  school  house  ;  conceiving,  I  suppose,  that  I 
should  be  obliged  to  postpone  my  appointment. 

Friday  I4th.  I  rode  to  the  townsliip  of  Woodhouse,  and 
stopped  for  tlie  night  at  the  house  of  my  valuable  friend,  who 
has  througliout  shewn  me  the  kindness  and  affliction  of  a 
brother,  and  has  taken  the  deepest  interest  in  the  Mission  with 
which  I  am  charged. 

Saturday  15th.  I  left  again  for  Walpole,  and  had  a  dreary 
and  tedious  ride. 

Sunday  16th.  The  heavy  and  incessant  rains  prevented  the 
people  from  assembling  at  the  usual  hour,  many  being  obliged 
to  come  great  distances.  The  rain  abating  a  little  about  noon, 
I  set  out  for  the  Irish  settlement.  I  was  obliged  to  ride  fre- 
quently through  the  waters,  which  were  considerably  swollen, 
the  wind  setting  in  to  the  land,  from  the  lake.  After  a  toilsome 
journey,  I  arrived  in  time,  and  was  glad  to  perceive  a  good  coi.- 
gregation  awaiting  my  visit.  They  seemed  rejoiced  to  see  me. 
I  read  the  evening  service  and  preached,  and  after  service  dis- 
tributed tracts.  Being  worn  out  by  my  day's  work,  T  immediately 
retired  to  rest,  after  family  worship,  and  was  pleased  to  hear  one 
of  the  tracts  read  aloud   in  the  family;  the  reader  making

his  attention.  A  tremendous  storm  of  wind  and  rain  prevailed 
throughout  the  night. 

Monday  17th.  I  left  for  Woodhouse  ;  the  travelling  to-day 
was  beyond  anything  I  had  yet  experienced,  dreary  and  uncom- 
fortable ;  the  roads  covered  with  water  and  the  trees  almost 
etrippod  of  their  foliage,  presented  a  cheerless  aspect.  I  was 
obliged  to  step  at  a  tavern  not  being  able  to  cross  the  bridge  which 
connects  Dover  and  Waljjole,  the  waters  of  the  creek  having 
been  so  much  increased  as  to  cover  to  a  great  depth  not  only  the 
bridge,  but  the  surrounding  flats.  In  the  evening  I  assembled 
tiie  members  of  the  family  and  the  various  inmates,  and  lectured 
to  them  from  a  portion  of  St.  John.  The  tavern-keeper,  whom 
I  consider  to  be  an  universalist,  listened  very  attentively. 

Tuesday  10th.  The  waters  being  somewhat  abated,  I 
resolved  to  prosecute  my  route.  Previoiis  to  my  departure, 
having  asked  for  my  bill,  the  tavern  keejjer  said,  "  No  charge 
Sir,  I  feel  1  am  a  wicked  man  ;"  and  although  I  urged  him  much 
to  accept  something  at  least,  he  civilly  but  firmly  declined.  In 
the  evening  I  preached  at  the  school  hotise  in  Dover  ;  prayers 
were  read  by  my  friend  Mr.  Evans,  who  had  come  to  meet  me  ; 
and  after  service  I  accomj)anied  him  home. 

Thursday  20th.  I  visited  a  few  families  of  the  Church,  and 
was  gladly  received  by  them  all. 

Friday  21st.  Visited  a  sick  woman,  a  member  of  the 
Church.  I  read  a  portion  of  Scripture,  and  joined  with  the 
family  in  prayer  ;  and  in  the  evening  I  visited  another  family. 

Saturday  22nd.  I  set  out  for  Burford,  and  was  obliged  to 
make  a  very  circuitous  route  on  account  of  the  bad  state  of  the 
roads,  and  in  consequence  did  not  arrive  till  a  very  late  hour  at 
;Mr.  Moore's. 

Sunday  23rd.  I  read  morning  service  and  preached  in  the 
school  house  ;  the  resjionses  and  singing  were  admirable — an 
unction  from  on  high  seemed  to  reign  throughout  the  whole 
congregation.  I  afterwards  drove  to  the  Dutch  Settlement, 
where  I  read  evening  prayers  and  preached,  and  closed  the  day 
with  family  prayer. 

Monday  24th.  I  visited  a  sick  woman,  apparently  dying  of 
consumption,  and  was  grieved  to  see  her  husband  drunk, 
apparently  a  heartless  creature.  As  I  apprehended  some 
n  opposition  from  him,  I  did  not  speak  much  to  his  wife  about 
her  state  before  God.  Not  wishing  however  to  lose  an  opportu- 
nity of  speaking  to  her  of  Jesus,  I  waited  a  considerable  time, 
and  at  length  conceiving  a  favourable  moment  presented  itself, 
I  embraced  it  by  asking  her  several  questions  :  but,  alas  !  what 
were  her  hopes  of  acceptance  ?  —that  she  had  not  sinned  so 
much  as  many  of  her  acquaintances  !  !  !  Having  enquired 
whether  she  considered  herself  as  holy  a  person  as  David, 
or  whether  she  needed  a  saviour  at,  much  as  he  did,  she 
quickly  assented  to  this,  I  then  read  a  few  verses  of  the  57th 
Psalm.  During  our  conversation  the  husband  entered,  who 
had  been  absent  for  some  time^  he  listened  to  our  conversation 
without  offering  any  interruption.  Having  commended  her 
and  her's  to  the  Father  of  Mercies,  I  took  my  leave,  praying  that

the  Lord  would  commence  his  work  in  the  heart  both  of  husband 
and  wife. 

Tuesday  25th.  I  set  off  for  Norwich  In  the  evening  I  read 
prayers  and  preached  to  a  mixed  confrregation  in  the  house  of 
Mr.  Davis,  a  zealous  Churchman,  and  I  liope  a  true  Israelite.  I 
closed  the  day  with  family  prayer. 

Wednesday  26th.  I  endeavoured  to  improve  some  opportu- 
nities this  day,  to  the  glory  of  God.  1  read  to  the  tamily 
Erskinc's  Tract  on  the  Lord's  Supper,  as  also  Pike's  "  Religion 
and  Eternal  Life."  A  few  friends  being  present  with  the  family, 
I  afterwards  delivered  a  short  lecture. 

Thursday  27th.  I  rode  to  the  lower  settlement  in  the  town- 
ship, accompanied  b^  Mr.  Robinson.  I  preached  in  the  school 
house,  and  lectured  in  the  evening  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Addison. 

Friday  28th.  I  proceeded  to  Middleton.  The  roads  were 
very  deep,  and  the  causeways  in  many  places  dangerous,  beinj^ 
covered  with  water.  I  was  therefore  obliged  to  travel  slowly 
and  cautiously.    I  lectured  in  the  evening. 

Saturday  29th.  I  proceeded  forward  to  Vienna,  where  I 
was  kindly  received  by  Mr.  Wright,  and 

Sunday,  30th  Oct.,  1835,  went  to  Port  Burwell,  where  I  read 
the  morning  service  and  preached  in  the  Church.  In  the 
evening  I  officiated  in  the  school  house  at  Vienna.  In  both  places 
I  had  very  large  congregations. 

In  the  evening  I  baptized  a  child  at  the  house  of  Mr. 
Draper,  and  closed  the  day  with  family  worship. 

As  the  Toronto  Society  publishes  always  from  November,  I 
close  the  present  Journal  here.  The  remainder  will  appear  in 
their  next  report,  according  to  your  wish.  I  am  so  hurried 
at  present  to  gain  the  opportunity  of  sending  you  this,  that  I 
cannot  write  :  but,  D.V.,  you  shall  shortly  hear  from  me  again.

IIERVEY  VACIIELL. 
To  tho  Rev.  W.  J.  D.  Waddilove. 

(hubeCy  Jan.  1837. 
You  must  long  since  liavc  given  niu  up  for  lost,  but  I  \vive 
littlo  time  for  writing  in  the  course  of  my  rambling  life,  being 
however  now  snowed  up  here,  I  think  I  mav  as  well  take  ao- 
vantage  of  this  uncommon  circumstance,  anci  write  to  you  a  few 
lines  giving  some  account  of  myself  and  my  proceedings.  I  am 
lately  returned  from  an  excursion  to  three  settlement'*  in  this 
neighbourhood,  or  to  speak  more  properly  in  the  district  of 
Quebec  ;  the  furthest  sixteen  miles  oiF,  indeed  those  who  are  so 
zealously  engaged  in  the  service  of  Upper  Canada,  liave  little 
idea  of  the  destitution  of  places  almost  within  sight  of  Quebec, 
our  capital. 

Short  as  my  tour  has  been,  since  I  left  Grosse  Isle,  (about 
twenty-five  days)  I  have  seen  enough  to  say  "  darkness  covers 
the  earth,  and  gross  dprkness  the  people."  I  have  personally 
visited  about  one  hundred  and  twenty  families,  scattered  about 
in  the  bush,  these  are  not  considered  the  worst  oif,  for  in  one 
settlement  a  Minister  is  supposed  to  attend  otite  in  a  month, 
whilst  all  the  others  have  the  benefit  of  a  $ermon  tmce  a  year.  In 
the  first  of  these  I  visited  thirty-one  families,  total  number  of 
persons,  one  hundred  and  sixty  ;  number  able  to  read,  ninety-ti* ; 
copies  of  the  scriptures,  thirty.  In  about  three  families  only  did  I 
find  the  common  observance  of  family  devotion,  all  alike  lament- 
obly  ignorant  of  the  word  of  God,  about  two  or  three  children 
only  that  understood  any  thing  of  the  scriptures.  One  school  in 
the  settlement  at  which  about  sixteen  or  twenty  attend  regularly, 
at  least  tolerably  so.  A  building  erected  for  Church  service  at 
which  I  collected,  at  the  morning  service  upwards  of  seventy,  at 
the  evening  (the  first  time  since  the  formation  of  the  settlement

that  a  second  service  had  been  lield"^  between  fifty  and  sixty.  This 
place  is  called  Valentia,.  about  fittoen  nillos  from  Quebec  !  !  ! 
The  next  place  I  went  ct.  va»  St.  Pu+rick,  on  Irish  settlemei. *, 
about  ten  miles  further  N.W.  I  visited  here  sixteen  families, 
much  i.iterspersed  amongst  Roman  Catholics,  total  in  families, 
n'meiij-fire  ;  can  road,  foiiy-four  ;  copies  of  the  scriptures^  ten.  In 
only  two  families  did  I  discern  any  ■&gt;  ^stij^c  of  religion.  The 
Roman  Catholics  are  most  zealous,  being  headed  by  their  Pries', 
in  perverting  :  very  many  are  already  turnt'd,  others  turning. 
iVo  school,  except  a  lloman  Catholic,  to  which  Protestant  children 
;;o  at  the  peril  of  being  continually  harrase^^d  and  tempted  by 
their  school  follows,  till  they  turn.  No  (Jhuroh,  onelnis  been  two 
years  building,  and  stands  now  a  laughing  stock  to  the  Ro?'' 
Catholics,  none  of  the  pe&lt;)i)le  having  a  mind  to  the  work,  Nei  m. 
iv.  6.  All  the  children  in  utter  ignoi-ance  of  the  word  of  God, 
and  therefore  just  fit  for  Popery,  for  with  them  L'Ignorance  est 
la  mere  de  la  Devotioii,  By  a  most  singular  providence  of  the 
Lord's,  I  fell  in  with  and  put  up  at  the  house  of  the  Roman 
Catholic  Priest  of  the  parish.  Having  arrived  when  it  was  quite 
dark,  1  stopped  at  a  hoi.se  to  enquire  where  I  could  put  up  ;  and 
after  a  little  time  tlie  Priest  came  out,  and  invited  mo  most 
hospitably  to  his  place.  He  was  oiice  a  Presbyterian,  and 
possesses  in  his  now  faith  great  sway  over  his  people. 

At  the  next  place  I  visited  I  round  many  things  to  discourage 
and  caRt  down.  The  settlement  is  princ'pally  Protestant,  but 
such  filth,  misery,  wretchedness,  and  ignorance,  I  never  befor? 
met  with.  There  were  thirty-seven  families,  total,  one  hundred 
and  eMjhty-six ;  can  read,  one  hundred  and  four  ;  bibles,  thirtif-three. 
There  is  a  catechist  and  scJiool  which  he  keeps ;  the  S,  P.G.F.P, 
paying  hiin  for  the  duties  of  the  first  office  ;  the  S'.ttls  u  should 
poy  lum  for  thos^  of  the  second,  but  he  gets  nothing,  nay  they 
will  not  even  send  their  ciiildren.  This  last  year  the  crops  fa'led 
and  left  them  in  much  distress ;  both  as  to  provisions  ?nd  clothing, 
they  are  miserably  off  ;  but  the  root  of  the  ev'.l  is  bad  manage- 
ment, proceeding  from  the  unsettfed  habits  po  constantly  found 
amongst  the  Irisli,  there  is  hardly  an  Eng'ish  family  amongst 
them.  Indeed  I  think  myself  that  though  their  poverty  is  un- 
avoidable, yet  cleanliness  even  amongst  rag.^,  and  a  cometiiing 
of  the  appearance  of  comfort,  even  in  the  deepest  distress,  are 
and  may  be  always  found  whei-e  Christ  is  formed  in  the  heart, 
and  cleanliness  in  the  poor  maa's  house  'at  least  in  this  country, 
though  the  rule  will  hardly  bear  in  England,  where  dirtiness  is 
disgraceful)  generally  betokens  some  degree  of  godliness  in  the 
heart.  In  this  settlement  1  did  not  find  ahore  tao  or  three  children 
possessing  even  a  shadow  of  religious  knowledge.  The  catechist 
vent  little  further  in  his  instructions  than  the  mere  tec  iiing  of 
the  catechism,  and  reading  the  scriptures  I  held  service  here 
and  collected  oulj'  about  forty-five  persor.  i  out  of  the  thirty-six 
families  ;  on  a  week  day,  somewhat  more  !  and  I  found  bu  one 
or  two  houses  were  family  prayer  was  regularly  kept  up. 
:^  The  next  setlement  was  pretty  much  like  it,  I  visited  about 
twenty-one  families,  total,  ninety-eight;  ca,u  read,  fifty-nine;  bibles, 
eighteen,  I  met  with  here  however,  I  think,  more  decided  spiritual 
light,  and  had  altogether  more  comfort,  still  however,  had  I  a

heart  that  could  feel  more,  I  should  be  more  inclined  to  say, 
"  oh  that  my  head  were  waters,  and  mine  eyes  a  fountain  of  tears, 
"  that  I  might  weep  day  and  night,"  for  the  miserable  state  of 
poor  sinners  here  left  to  themselves,  and  who  in  their  blindness 
and  their  ignorance  still  say,  "  I  shall  have  peace  thoiigii  I  walk 
in  the  imaginations  of  mine  heart."  Oh  !  my  dear  sir,  what  are 
we  Watchmen  about  ?  surely  we  are  but  half  awake  ourselves  ! 
Where  is  the  sound  of  our  bowels,  where  are  our  bowels  of  mercy 
for  souls,  immortal  souls,  when  constantly  we  see  them  drop,  one 
after  another,  before  our  eyes,  to  spend  by  our  neglect  an  im- 
mortality in  hell  !  !  Alas  !  alas  !  may  God  in  his  great  love  stir 
us  up  to  be  more  alire,  "  lest  we  provoke  him  to  anger  and  to  swear 
"  in  his  wrath,  that  we  ourselves  shall  never  outer  into  his  rest :" 
may  we  strive  with  more  urgent  love,  which  will  give  more 
earnestness  to  our  words,  more  zeal  to  our  actions,  more  force  to 
cur  arjfimients,  to  save  brands  fi-om  the  burning.  May  He  make 
the  sword  of  the  spirit  a  more  powerful  insti'ument  in  our  hands, 
to  overcome  those  who  rise  up  against  the  Lord  and  his  anointed. 
I  iidve  hardly  left  room  to  say  tbat  I  begin  tu  fear  the  st  ety, 
in  whose  service  the  Bishop  placed  me,  will  fall  to  the  gi'ound  for 
want  of  funds,  I  tarry  however  the  Lord's  leisure,  I  desire  to  be 
still  to  watch  his  providence  and  follow,  not  to  go  before  Ilini. 
In  the  meantime  let  me  know  what  you  wish  me  to  do,  sliould 
what  I  anticipate,  actually  take  place. 

IIERVEY  VACHELL. 
Rev.  W.  J.  D.  Waddilove. 
The  society  alluded  to,  is  the  society  formed  at  Quebec  by  the 
influence  ex  tlie  late  Bishop,  similar  to  the  Society  at  Toronto, 
and  I  have  reason  to  believe  that  the  melancholy  consummation 
which  Mr.  Vachell  expected,  is  now  not  likely  to  occur.  The 
instructions  I  sent  him  were  to  fall  back  ir  such  case  upon  me, 
and  to  apply  to  the  Bishop  of  Montreal  to  p  ^sign  him  a  Travelling 
District  in  the  Upper  Province,  foi  which  he  was  originally  des- 
tined, and  to  which  service  my  funds  are  specifically  confined, 
except  in  so  far,  as  the  late  Bishop  of  Quebec,  required  and  re- 
ceived assistance  elsewhere.  I  have  however  lately  heard  from 
the  Bishop  of  Montreal,  that  Mr.  Va?hell  will  be  continued  in 
the  Lower  P'-ovince,  and  I  have  been  requested,  as  agent  of  "  the 
Siowart  fund,"  to  send  out  a  successor  to  Mr.  Vachell,  to  be 
placed  at  the  disposal  of  "  the  Society  for  Converting  and  Civiliz- 
"  ing  the  Indians,  and  sjjreading  the  Gospel  arnon^-at  the  Destitute 
**  Settlers  of  Upper  Canada"  established,  as  I  have  before  stated, 
in  1830,  at  Toronto.  EDITOR. 


Extract  of  a  Letter  from  the  Rev. ^  Missionary  in  one  of  the 

Seftlemenis  on  the  Bitt,^  Sorely  South  of  Montreal^  Lower  Canada^ 
recciredJannari;  itk,  1837. 

I  have  beeu  the  honoured  instrument  in  the  hands  of  God 
of  bringing  about  one  most  gi-atifying  case  of  conversion,  I  trust, 
both  to  Protestardi^m  and  to  God.  My  landlady,  a  Canadian  and 
c  truly  good  woman,  worshipped  with  us  in  public  yesterday  for 
the  first  time.  I  spoke  to  her  on  the  subject  of  religion,  and 
read  some  passages  from  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews  to  her  a 
few  days  after  I  arrived,  but  she  seemed  much  annoyed  ;  one

remark  I  made,  however,  took  such  hold  upon  her  mind  that  she 
could  not  sleep,  (slie  iias  since  told  me,)  for  several  nights ;  slio 
afterwards,  at  family  prayer,  stationed  herself  near  the  door,  for 
she  wou!d  never  come  in ;  when  I  found  this  out  I  invariably 
p)*ayed  for  her  thougii  not  by  name.  About  two  weeks  ago,  a  de- 
serving member  of  the  congregation  told  me  that  Mrs.  Unwin  had 
been  to  see  her  in  great  distress  of  mind,  telling  herthat  herformer 
faith  was  greatly  shaken,  and  that  she  felt  extremely  wretched 
and  miserable.  When  I  he;ird  this  I  took  the  first  o})portunity 
of  speaking  to  lier,  I  offered  to  go  over  all  the  points  in  dispute 
between  ourselves  and  the  Church  of  Rome,  bible  inhaud,  wiiich 
1  did  for  several  days  together  ;  I  told  her  to  pray  for  the  gift 
and  the  guidance  of  God's  Holy  Spirit  to  shew  her  the  truth, 
wliich,  I  believe,  she  did  most  fervently.  I  never  saw  such 
anxiety  for  the  trutli,  such  deep  sorrow  for  past  darkness  and 
neglect,  and  such  meekness  for  instruction,  in  any  person  before. 
It  ended,  as  I  have  mentioned,  and  lias  served  to  cheer  me  up 
not  a  little  under  "  fears  within  and  fightings  without." 

In  connection  with  this  I  learned  the  other  day  a  circum- 
stance which  gave  me  sincere  pleasure.  About  eigteen  miles 
below  this,  at  St.  Francois,  is  a  tribe  of  Indians  under  the  spiri- 
tual domination  of  the  llomisli  Church  :  a  few  years  since,  one 
of  tlxe  tribe  wandered  away  into  the  United  States  ;  although 
he  could  not  yet  speak  one  word  of  English,  he  wandered  away 
to  Dartmouth  College,  in  New  Hampshire  I  believe,  where  some 
express  provision  is  made  for  the  education  of  Indians  ;  in  four 
or  five  years  he  got,  not  only  a  good  education,  but  also  a 
knowledge  of  the  truth,  to  which  he  was  for  some  time  bitterly 
opposed  ;  he  returned  to  his  native  village,  and  from  his  attain- 
ments was  speedily  promoted  to  the  situation  of  schoolmaster 
and  interpreter  ;  but  he  did  not  long  let  his  talent  lie  hid  in  a 
napkin  ;  he  went  to  work  reading  the  scriptures,  praying  and 
conversing  from  hut  to  hut,  and  God  blessed  his  labours  to  the 
conversion  of  some  fifteen  or  twenty  other  poor  Indians.  Oppo- 
sition, however,  soon  began  to  assail  him  on  the  part  of  tlie 
Priests,  who  trembled  for  their  power, — the  storm  raged  loud 
and  long ;  the  Priests  wrote  to  their  Bishop,  to  the  Superinten- 
dent of  Indian  affairs,  and  to  the  Governor,  it  is  said  ;  the  result 
was,  that  the  poor  little  Indian  was  dismissed  from  his  situa- 
tions and  set  adrift  in  the  Avorld  ;  but  when  man  forsook  him 
God  took  him  up.  Some  of  his  quondam  friends  in  the  States 
hearing  of  the  state  of  things,  urged  him  to  apply  for  ordination 
to  some  Presbytery  they  named,  and  for  support  to  the  Foreign 
Missionary  Society, "which  he  did,  and  got  both.  They  furnished 
him  also  with  a  small  press — thus  fortified,  he  returned  to  his 
post  and  re-commenced  operations — printing,  preaching,  writing, 
reading,  and  "adding  to  the  Church  daily  such  as  shall  be 
saved."  He  was  up  here  ten  or  twelve  days  ago,  on  his  way  to 
Montreal,  to  raise  money  to  build  a  Church..  I  had  a  long  talk 
witii  him,  and  encouraged  him  to  the  utmost  of  my  power  ;  he 
raised  a  very  tolerable  sum  here,  and  in  four  days'  rounds  in 
Montreal,  completed  the  amount ;  he  is  back  again  at  his  post 
in  the  very  heart  of  Popish  delusion  and  darkness,  battling  away 
uiaufully  against  the  errors  of  that  Church.    I  am  told  that  in

THE  FIRST  REPORT 

0/  the  Society  for  j&gt;rojia(jatln(f  the  GuKj'el  amonij  the  destitute  Settleri 
and  Indians  in  Lower  Canada. 

In  presenting  this,  their  first  Report  to  the  public,  the 
Committee  feel  it  to  be  their  duty  to  give  some  account  of  the 
history  and  objects  of  tlie  Society. 

Thi&gt;  Society  was  first  formed  in  June,  18H5,  although  it  did 
not  assume  its  present  name  till  February,  lUliCi.  At  its  first 
formation,  measures  were  taken  for  engaging  the  services  of  a 
Clergyman  to  itinerate  within  the  district  of  (Quebec,  and  to 
remain  at  Urosse  Isle 

In  furtherance  of  those 
licensed  by   the  Bishop   of  Quebec,  as   the  Missionary  of  the 
Society  ;  and  commenced  his  ministerial  labours  at  Grosse  Ible, 
in  the  latter  part  of  June,  1835. 

Here  he  remained  till  the  middle  of  September,  visiting 
the  sick  in  the  hospital,  bui'ying  the  dead,  and  preaching  where- 
ever  he  had  an  opportunity,  to  the  troops  and  others  resident 
on  the  island,  as  well  as  to  those  strangers  from  Europe,  wlio 
frequently  in  large  numbers  land  here,  and  remain  until  allowed 
by  the  quarantine  regulations  to  proceed.  He  then  went  down 
to  Metis,  a  destitute  settlement  210  miles  from  Quebec,  where 
seventy  persons  "t  least,  entirely  cut  off  from  the  means  of 
grace,  and  unaccustomed  to  hear  in  public  the  soimd  of  the 
Gospel,  gladly  availed  themselves  of  the  'ipportunity  thus 
afforded  by   his  presence  among  them. 

After  visiting  the  few  scattered  ^  '  U'ujents  lying  between 
Metis  and  Quebec,  he  returned  to  Gro.--  f  ^h',  wliere  ho  remained 
till  the  close  of  the  navigation.  He  no^'  directed  hi.-,  course  to 
the  settlements  on  the  south  side  of  the  St.  l«iwvi  nee,  s]iending 
some  time  in  Frampton,  St.  Charles  on  the  Kennebec,  iirough- 
ton,  Ireland,  Inverness,  and  visiting  the  differei  t  smaller 
settlements  in  their  neighbourhood. 

On  the  resignation  of  Mr.  Knight,  arising  out  of  the  wish, 
and  consequent  exertions  of  the  Settlers  of  Frampton,  (whose 
affections  he  had  gained  in  his  previous  labours  as  a  Cate«  hist 
on  the  spot,)  to  have  him  resident  among  them,  the  Rev.  Harvey 
Vachell,  whose  zeal  and  faithfulness  in  the  discharge  of  his 
duties  as  Curate  of  Quebec,  had  recommended  him  to  the  atten- 
tion of  the  Society,  was  chosen  to  succeed  him  ;  but  in  conse- 
quence of  the  Stay  of  the  Rector  of  Quebec  in  England,  Al 
Vachell  was  not  able  to  commence  his  Missionary  labours  till 
the  month  of  September,  1836. 

In  the  course  of  the  summer,  however,  a  few  visits  were 
paid  by  other  Clergyman  resident  in  Quebec,  to  the  station  at 
Grosse  Isle  :  and  Mr.  Knight,  by  appointment  of  the  Bishop  of

Quebec,  again  went  down  to  Metis.    On  this  occasion  he  wont 
thirty  miles  further,  to  Matan. 

At  both  places,  as  well  at  Riviere  du  Loup,  on  the  west  side 
of  Metis,  he  was  welcomed  by  attentive  cong^re/jfptions  ;  and 
preached  to  listening  hearers,  who  seldom  for  years  had  heard 
the  word  of  life. 

On  the  16th  September,  Mr.  Vachell,  now  released  from 
his  eugagements  in  Quebec,  by  the  arrival  of  the  Bishop  of 
Montreal,  proceeded  to  Grosse  Isle,  where  he  remained  a  month, 
till  the  hospital  was  empty — preaching  three  times  on  the 
Sabbath  days,  visiting  the  sick,  reading  the  Scriptures,  distri- 
buting Tracts,  conversing  and  praying  with  all  who  were  willing 
to  avail  themselves  of  his  ministrations. 

In  tlie  beginning  of  November,  he  crossed  the  river  St. 
Lawrence  to  Liverpool,  taking  Belaire  in  his  route  ;  and  after 
visiting  the  families  in  this  district,  he  re-crossed  the  river  to 
Valcartier  and  lliviere  aux  Pins. 

In  the  beginning  of  December  he  proceeded  to  St.  Patricks, 
thence  after  seven  days  of  trying  exertion,  to  Bourg  Louis,  Cap 
Santd,  and  Port  Neuf,  taking  the  scattered  settlements  in  his 
route. 

As  soon  as  the  violent  storm  in  the  beginning  of  January 
would  allow  him  to  begin  travelling  again,  lie  crossed  the  St. 
Lawrence  to  the  settleuisnts  formerly  visited  by  Mr.  Knight, 
and  other  new  and  similar  ones,  which  had  not  yet  been  visited 
by  any  Missionary. 

In  this  tour  of  eleven  weeks  he  visited  St.  Nicholas,  St. 
Giles,  diflferent  smaller  settlements  in  the  neighbourhood  of 
Leeds,  Inverness,  Ireland,  Upper  Ireland,  Halifax,  Bonnet's 
Settlement,  and  all  the  smaller  settlements  or  concessionc  in 
this  vast  tract  of  country.  His  plan  was  to  take  up  his  residence 
in  some  central  place,  there  to  preach  to  congregations  wherever 
they  could  be  assembled  ;  and  in  the  intermediate  time  to  go 
from  house  to  house,  travelling  on  snow  shoes  when  the  road 
was  otherwise  impassable,  and  seeking  out  every  scattered 
wandering  sheep  in  the  wilderness  ; — and  from  many  interesting 
particulars  related  by  liim,  and  also  by  Mr.  Knight,  there  is 
reason  to  hope  that  their  united  exertions  have  not  been  in  vain 
— that  God  has  blessed  their  faithful  endeavours  to  the  awaken- 
ing of  some  who  were  dead  in  trespasses  and  sins — to  the 
quickening  of  others  who  were  sinking  into  religious  apathy — 
to  the  encouragement  of  many  who  were  giving  up  all  hope  of 
ever  being  able  to  join  again  in  the  worshij)  of  the  Church  of 
England,  and  so  becoming  c  ireless  to  what  system  of  error  they 
might  attach  themsel  ves. 

Such,  by  the  blessing  of  God,  have  b  3en  the  labours  already 
undertaken  and  accomplished  by  this  Society.  In  laying  them 
before  the  Society  and  the  public,  the  Committee  cannot  refrain 
from  expressing  their  thankfulness  to  Him  who  hath  put  it  into 
the  hearts  of  any  of  his  servants  to  attempt  such  a  necessary 
work,  and  hath  also  thus  far  ruled  and  overruled  the  wills  of 
others  to  the  promotion  of  it.  And  they  trust  that  the  objects 
in  view  are  such  as  require  but  to  be  stated,  in  order  that  they 
may  be  appreciated,  and  more  generally  "vomoted.

It  is  not  to  p:ive  bread  to  the  hungry,  and  bodily  comforts  to 
the  houseless  and  naked  :  it  i^  not  to  bind  up  the  wounds  and 
remove  the  diseases  of  those  who  for  want  ot  an  earthly  physi- 
cian are  readj'  to  perish  :  No  !  Tliough  the  Committee  feel  as- 
ssured,  that  if  these  were  the  objects  which  they  had  in  view, 
the  call  to  promote  them  would  not  be  made  in  vain.  But  they 
have  h'ujher  uhjects,  itm  ^  urtjent  irantf,  more  cryiiK)  dhtresses  in  view. 
Souls  are  peri.shin{,r !  Hell  is  enlarging  herself  without  measure  ! 
Sin,  ignorance,  and  error  are  yearly  slaying  their  hundreds  ! 
Nay,  s{)iritual  death  is  swallowing  up  thousands  who  have  almost 
no  man  to  care  for  their  souls,  none  to  lead  them  to  the  ^reat 
Physician,  none  to  speak  comfortably  to  them  and  tell  them  that 
there  is  remission  of  sins  through  a  Saviour,  that  they  have  an 
all  healing  balm  in  the  gospel,  an  ever  ready  physician  there. 
It  is  to  souhy  wretched,  and  n.iserable,  and  i)oor,  and  i)erishinj(, 
that  they  seek,  under  the  Divine  blessing,  to  communicate  life, 
light,  comfort,  and  salvation  ;  and  they  are  not  afraid  to  assert, 
tliat  in  the  same  proportion  as  heaven  is  more  valuable  than 
earth,  and  eternal  more  dreadful  than  temporal  misery,  so  the 
wants  of  the  soul  are  more  to  be  regarded  and  more  carefully  to 
be  supplied  than  those  of  tlie  body. 

That  the  Protestant  settlers  in  the  large  tract  of  country 
chosen  in  the  sphere  of  the  society's  labours  are  in  this  state  of 
spiritual  destitution,  may  be  seen  from  the  annexed  extracts 
from  the  Missionaries'  journals.  That  they  are  likely  to  remain 
so  for  a  considerable  time,  if  left  to  their  own  resources,  must  be 
evident  to  every  one  who  ka.  )ws  any  thing  of  the  state  of  new 
settlements.  But  then  shall  they  be  allowed  to  remain  in  such 
a  condition,  while  their  need  might  be  (at  least  in  some  measure) 
supplied  out  of  ourp'nmdauce  ? 

The  Committee  now  proceed  to  quote  some  few  extracts 
from  the  Missionaries'  journals,  transmitted  to  them  from  time 
to  time.  ,^.,;.,. 

FROM    MR.    knight's   JOURNAL. 

Sunday,  2nd  August. — I  preached  to  about  sixty  persons 
from  Renfrewshire.  On  .'iinday  9th,  performed  service  to  up- 
wards of  a  hundred  persons,  principally  from  the  neighbourhood 
of  Inverness,  and  dissenters.  It  was  upon  this  occasion,  that 
when  I  said  to  them,  the  service  is  not  that  to  which  you  have 
been  accustomed,  one  of  them  answered,  O  Sii',  that  is  no  matter, 
if  you  only  preach  the  gosi)el.  I  told  them  I  would  gladly  give 
them  an  opportunity  of  judging. 

Sunday,  6th  December. — I  jjreached  again  at  St,  Charles,  to 
a  congregation  of  between  seventy  and  eiglity  persons. 

On  Tuesday  I  proceeded  up  the  Kennebec  road,  with  Mr. 
*****,  (who  kindly  accompanied  me,)  and  preached  to 
a  small  congregation  from  the  townsliips  of  Marlow  and  Jersey  ; 
several  persons  came  in  just  as  I  had  finished  ;  I  was  sorry  to 
hear  that  general  notice  had  not  been  explicitly  given  by  the 
person  who  had  undertaken  to  do  it.  This  was  the  first  sermon 
preached  in  th.at  neighbourhood.  Before  sermon  commenced, 
I  baptized  a  child.  On  my  return  to  St.  Charles  the  next  day,  I 
met  one  of  the  persons  who  had  been  too  late  the  evening  be- 
fore, (a  dissenter,)  he  seemed  mucli  affected  while^  expressing

his  refifrot  at  their  destitution  of  the  means  of  grace,  and  at  not 
having  been  present  in  time,  owing  to  his  not  having  received 
intimation  until  I  passed  his  house.  His  feelings  impeded  his 
utterance,  and  Mr.  *****  told  me  that  t'le  tears  were 
rolling  down  his  cheeks,  as  he  turned  away  to  go.  On  the 
following  days  I  visited  most  of  the  families  in  the  neighbour- 
hood, and  on  Saturday  I  baptized  a  child  privately, 

Friday  18th.  After  much  difficulty  I  reached  Mr.  Hall's  at 
Broughton,  and  on  Saturday  I  went  to  see  a  sick  man  appa- 
rently in  the  last  stage  of  consumption. 

Sunday  20th.  I  preached  to  a  very  attentive  congregation  of 
about  seventy  persons,  after  which  I  baptized  four  children.  On 
Monday  several  of  the  inhabitants  waited  upon  me  and  ex- 
pressed a  great  anxiety  for  the  services  of  a  clergyman  at 
regular  periods,  if  it  were  only  once  in  a  quarter,  and  their  wil- 
lingness to  contribute  towards  the  maintenance  of  a  missionary 
for  this  purpose,  as  far  as  their  means  would  permit.  I  after- 
wards visited  several  of  the  families,  in  one  of  which  I  was  re- 
&lt;^uested  to  give  them  a  "  word  of  prayer,"  as  it  was  the  first 
time  a  cler^yyinan  was  in  the  house.  I  of  course  complied,  and 
oflTered  up  a  prayer  for  the  extension  of  the  gospel,  more  parti- 
cularly among  the  destitute  settlements  throughout  the  district, 
and  the  whole  diocese,  and  for  a  blessing  on  the  exertions  of  the 
society,  which  had  provided  for  them  the  present  opportunity  of 
hearing  the  word  of  life.  I  also  attended  a  sick  person.  This 
visit  was  more  satisfactory  than  the  previous  one,  which  had,  I 
trust,  been  instrumental  in  giving  him  clear  views  of  the  only 
ground  of  our  acceptance,  and  corresponding  humility  and 
comfort. 

Friday,  Christmas  day,  I  preached  to  a  congregation  of 
about  sixty  persons,  in  a  neat  little  school  house,  erected  at  the 
private  expense  of  Mr.  •  *  *  *^  one  of  the  i)rincipal  inhabi- 
tants. On  Saturday  I  visited  several  of  the  families  in  the 
neighbourhood,  and  in  Benuet's  Settlement,  and  baptized  eleven 
cliildren. 

Sunday  27th.  To  my  great  satisfaction  the  person  at  whose 
house  I  had  been  most  kindly  entertained  for  three  days,  decided 
upon  having  his  family  baptized,  and  his  household,  ten  in 
number,  were  enrolled  among  the  followers  of  Christ. 

The  adults  seemed  much  imj)ressed  with  the  solemn  nature 
of  the  obligation  they  were  entering  into  ;  and  during  the  service 
were  affected  to  tears.  I  trust  that  their  hearts  were  prepared, 
and  that  through  God's  mercy  they  will  become  members  of  the 
Church  triumphant.  For  my  own  part  I  shall  always  look  back 
upon  it  as  one  of  the  most  interesting  and  happy  of  my  ministra- 
tions. 

I  preached  in  the  Methodist  Chapel  to  a  congi'egation  of 
about  a  hundred.  After  the  service  was  over,  several  persons 
came  forward  and  addressed  me  kindly.  One  welcomed  me  to 
that  part  of  the  country,  and  another  prayed  that  God  might 
speed  my  plough. 

Monday,  28th.  I  preached  at  the  house  of  Mrs.  *  *  *,  in  the 
Dublin  range  of  Inverness,  to  between  forty  and  fifty  persons, 
and  baptized  three  children.    On  the  following  day  I  preached 


219 


in  the  Scotch  settlement  in  that  townsliip,  in  the  house  of  Mr. 
*  *  *  *,  the  principal  person  in  that  neighbourhood.  They  are 
Presbyterians,  but  received  nio  very  cordially,  and  Mrs,  *  ♦  •  • 
shook  mo  by  the  liaiid  at  the  conclusion  of  the  discourse,  and  ex- 
pressed her  gladness  to  see  any  who  preached  the  Gospel  truly. 


EXTRACTS   FROM  THE   JOrUNAI.   OF  MR.   VACHELL. 

NOVEMliER. 

Saturday  19th.  Visited  one  family,  the  head  of  which,  a 
Scotchman,  much  surprised  me  by  telling  me  tliat  ho  was  turned 
a  Roman  Catholic,  and  soon  after  saying  so,  got  up  and  left  the 
room.  Visited  nine  families,  one,  a  poor  woman,  lately  arrived 
here  with  six  small  children,  listened  to  mo  with  the  deepest 
tearful  attention  :  tlie  words  of  the  Gospel  seemed  like  the 
words  of  a  well  known  friend  suddenly  striking  upon  tlie  ear  in 
a  foreign  land,  and  were  welcomed  as  the  spring  by  Hagar  in 
the  wilderness. 

Two  heads  of  families  I  saw,  both  lying  down  to  sleep  off 
the  eflFects  of  drink,  to  which  their  houses  and  families  boro 
testimony  they  were  too  much  addicted. 

Sunday  20th.  In  consequence  of  the  frost  the  preceding  few 
days,  and  the  river  having  taken  last  night,  none  from  the 
settlement  of  the  River  aux  Pins  were  able  to  come  over,  and 
only  one  family  from  the  opposite  side  crossed  (where  the  water 
was  rapid)  in  a  canoe.  I  had  a  congregation  of  about  seventy— 
never  had  more  fixed  attention ;  and  when  I  set  before  them 
their  sinful  mode  of  life,  their  profaneness,  Sabbatli  breaking, 
neglect  of  God's  word,  their  bringing  up  their  children  in  almost 
heathen  ignorance  ;  and  when  I  told  them,  to  use  St.  Paul's 
language,  Phil.  iii.  18,  even  weeping,  that  there  were  those 
amongst  them,  enemies  to  the  cross  of  Christ,  whose  end  was 
destruction,  whose  God  was  their  belly,  whose  glory  was  their 
shame,  &amp;c.,  some  seemed  evidently  much  affected,  and  God 
grant  the  effect  be  not  as  the  early  dew  that  fadeth  away.  Had 
afternoon  service  :  about  sixty  attended  ;  the  same  marked 
attention  as  before. 

DECEMBER. 

Sunday  4th.  Had  divine  service  this  day  at  a  Settler's  house  ; 
not  more  than  twenty-five ;  they  were  very  attentive  to  the  ser- 
mon, but  their  demeanour  at  prayers  evidenced  how  long  they 
had  been  unaccustomed  to  divine  worship.  Thus,  prayer  books 
were  very  few  ;  responses  not  made  ;  I  was  obliged  to  make  signs 
when  they  were  to  rise,  sit,  or  kneel.  Just  opposite  to  the  place 
where  we  had  service,  was  a  building  that  was  begun  about  two 
years  ago,  for  the  purpose  of  holding  divine  service,  and  it  was 
yet  unfinished. 

On  a  general  review  of  my  labours  in  this  settlement,  al- 
though I  cannot  but  say  with  pleasure  there  is  certainly  more 
decidedly  spiritual  light  than  at  the  last  place,  yet  I  never  in  my 
life  was  forced  to  witness  so  much  filth,  misery,  and  wretched- 
ness, the  sure  and  certain  signs  of  a  neglected  Gospel  and  a 
slighted  Saviour. 

I  found  some  making  a  profession  of  their  religion,  and  ready 
to  speak  of  their  experience  ;  but  when  I  came  to  seek  for  the

fruit  of  faith  ;  when  I  looked  for  tlie  universally  adopted  resolu- 
tion of  truly  converted  heads  of  fuTnilies,  "  as  for  nio  and  my 
house  wo  will  serve  the  Lord,"  wo  will  assemble  round  the  family 
altar,  we  will  hear  and  read  the  word  of  God,  we  will  join  our 
prayers,  we  will  sing  His  praises.  When  I  looked  for  children 
brought  up  in  the  nurture  and  admonition  of  the  Lord,  to  love 
His  word,  His  name,  His  day,  His  ways  ;  and  sought  for  holiness 
of  life  and  convorsation.  Alas  !  against  how  many  oven  among 
those  who  have  a  name  to  live  by,  might  the  Lord  write  Tekel, 
thou  art  wcfighod  in  tlio  balance  and  found  wanting. 

Friday  Kith.  Met  with  little  of  individual  interest,  except 
in  the  case  of  two  families — a  child  in  each  I  found  to  be 
in  absolute  heathen  darkness.  In  one,  wliere  I  performed  a 
baptism,  the  cliild,  an  intelligent  boy,  stared  first  at  me,  then  at 
his  mother,  in  astonhhrnetit,  when  told  to  kneel  down  to  pray  to 
Gvd ! !  The  mother  endeavoured  to  excuse  this,  by  saying, 
"  that  the  bush  was  a  bad  place  to  bring  up  children."  I 
endeavoured  to  point  out  the  sin  phe  was  guilty  of  in  thus 
neglecting  her  child.  At  another  house,  a  sensible-looking  little 
girl  was  in  utter  ignorance  of  God,  of  Heaven,  of  Hell,  of  who 
.Tesus  Christ  was  !  !  And  yet  the  mother  affirmed  she  regularly 
said  her  prayers :  a  painful  illustration  of  John  iv.  22,  "  Ye 
worship  ye  know  not  what."  At  another,  found  all  in  complete 
ignorance  and  negligence,  except  the  eldest  girl,  about  fifteen 
years  of  a^e. 

Notwithstanding,  however,  these  cases  of  ignorance,  and 
much  dirt  and  misery  in  some  houses,  on  the  whole  I  found 
more  decided  marks  of  piety,  and  more  Scriptural  knowledge, 
than  in  any  place  I  had  before  visited.  Found  family  prayers 
kept  up  in  one  family  only. 

LEEDS — SECOND   JOURNAL. 

Visited  six  families — I  held  conversation  in  one  of  them  with 
a  child  of  about  seven.  Who  is  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  ?  child 
laughing,  I  dont  know.  To  another — Did  you  ever  hear  of  the 
Lord  Jesus  ?  No.  To  a  third,  about  ten — Did  you  never  hear  for 
what  purpose  Jesus  Christ  came  into  the  world  ?  No.  And  can 
it  be  possible  that  none  of  you  ever  heard,  that  except  ye  believe 
in  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  you  must  perish  ;  for  you  have  all  sinned 
and  need  a  Saviour  ;  Turning  to  the  mother — Have  you  never 
taught  your  children  that  they  are  sinners  ?  My  children  never 
did  any  harm,  they  are  not  sinners.  But  the  scriptures  say  that 
all  have  sinned  :  even  a  child  is  known  by  his  doings,  wnether 
his  ways  are  pure  ;  and  foolishness  is  bound  up  in  the  heart  of  a 
child.  Ah  that  is  all  very  true,  but  there  is  no  sin  in  their 
hearts  yet  poor  dears.  Then  I  much  fear  you  have  never  yet 
been  brought  to  feel  yourself  a  lost  and  perishing  sinner.  Me  ! 
I  thank  God  I  am  no  sinner,  I  never  sinned  in  my  life  ! !  To  a 
few  other  questions,  she  returned  answers  shewing  evidently  she 
wished  I  would  either  hold  my  tongue  or  go.  Prayed  for  grace 
and  strength,  and  laid  before  her  as  forcibly  and  plainly  as  I 
could,  the  awful  state  of  her  soul,  and  warned  her  to  flee 
from  the  wrath  to  come,  to  the  Saviour.  Her  husband,  coming 
in,  evinced  the  same  totally  dark  state,  left  some  tracts  and

JANUARY. 
Thursday  26th.  Visited  ei^ht  families :  found  much  tern- 

Eoral  distress,  owine  to  the  badness  of  the  crops  last  season  ; 
ut  more  spiritual  distress,  (though,  alas  !  little  felt)  owinc;  to 
the  barrenness  of  stony  hearts  :  tlie  seed  sown  (though  there 
has  been  but  little  of  that)  having  fallen  on  the  way  side^  or 
upon  rocky  ground,  &amp;o.,  so  that  the  word  preached  has  little 
profited  them,  not  being  mixed  with  faith  m  them  that  heard 
it.  After  visiting  all  the  families,  collected  them  together  in  a 
central  house  ;  read  part  of  the  evening  service  ;  preached  to 
them  ;  sung,  at  the  commencement,  a  psalm  ;  and,  at  the  con- 
clusion, the  evening  hymn ;  pmyed ;  and  returned  to  my  old 
quarters  for  the  night. 

A.mid  many  mterruptions  to  which  the  Missionary  is 
constantly  exposod  in  these  cottage  meetings ;  such  as  the 
fidgetiness  of  restless  ill  trained  children,  the  noisy  efforts  of 
parents  and  others  restraining  them,  the  quarrelling  of  intrusivt; 
strange  dogs,  and  in  this  instance  the  constant  lowing  of  a  lately 
bom  calf  in  the  cellar  just  under  my  feet ;  yet  I  was  eniiDled  (and  I 
felt  reason  to  be  thankful  for  it)  to  arrest  the  attention  of  my 
congregation  (of  which  a  good  number  were  young  people)  in 
number  about  thirty  :  and  I  trust  I  may  have  been  permitted 
to  say  something  that  shall  prove  a  savour  of  life  unto  life,  to 
those  who  heard  me. 

FEBRUARY. 

Monday  6th.  Returned  to  Leeds  township ;  visited  first  and 
second  ranges,  two  families.  Kindly  entertained  at^  a  house 
where  the  owner's  hospitality  was  beyond  his  accommodations. 
Formed  one  of  a  party  of  eleven  that  slept  in  a  room  about 
twelve  feet  by  ten. 

Tuesday  7th.  Continued  my  visiting  along  the  first  and  second 
ranges,  and  crossed  on  snow  shoes,  about  two  miles  through  a 
swamp  in  a  heavy  snow  ;  visited  six  families. 

Sunday  12th.  Preached  in  the  morning  at  what  is  called  the 
♦  *  *  *  settlement,  to  a  congregation  of  about  twenty-five  adults, 
and  nearly  as  many  children  :  so  entirely  do  they  seem  to  have 
been  neglected,  and  neglected  themselves,  that  there  wore  only 
two  prayer  books  among  them,  and  those  possessing  them  did 
not  know  how  to  use  them — not  a  soul  knew  how  to  make  the 
responses :  I  speak  this  of  the  fonns  of  the  Church:  hereafter 
when  I  visit  them,  I  shall  be  able  to  say  more  of  their  Church 
(christian)  principles.  Preached  in  the  afternoon  to  a  pretty 
good  congregation  in  the  school  house,  on  the  opposite  side  of 
the  Lake  to  that  where  I  preached  on  Sunday  last. 

Visited  in  Ireland  and  Halifax,  twenty-five  families  ;  numb'  r 
of  bibles,  twenty-four ;  number  in  families,  one  hundred  and  thiy.j- 
fi/te ;  that  can  read,  setenty-nine ;  bibles  wanted,  one ;  application 
for  eight  prayer  books ;  baptized  fourteen  children  ;  preached  six 
timis  ;  examined  one  school,  and  distributed  a  variety  of  ti-acts. 


These  extracts  ought  to  speak  for  themselves  ;  let  them, 
then,  speak  to  the  heart  of  every  man,  who  values  the  blessine;

may  have  other  and  many  calls  to  tho  exercise  of  christian  charity,

is  to  supply,  as  far  as  man  may  bo  the  humble  instrument  of

oH&lt;-  want  is  still  unsupplied  ?  If  those  to  whom  wo  give,  ha'"(f 
not,  after  all,  the  tnie  riches?  If,  supplied  with  every  earthly

an  inheritance,  incorruptible,  undefiled,and  that  fadeth  not  away,

the  late  Hon.  ami  Itiijht  liev.  Charles  James  Stewart,  Lord  Bishop  of 
Quebec. 

Dated  from  Toronto,  Uvper  Canada,  June  22, 1837- 
Rev.  Sir, — At  the  desire  of  the  Lord  Bishop  of  Montreal, 
I  write  to  int'onn  you  of  the  arranproments  which  have  been 
mudo  by  his  Lordship  and  the  society,  &amp;c.,  in  reference  to  the 
missionaries  resident  in  Canada,  whose  salaries  are  chari^ble 
to  the  funds  raised  by  your  exertions  in  England.  The  loUow- 
ini;  is  an  extract  from  a  letter  of  the  Bishop  of  Montreal  to  me 
us  their  Secretary. 

Qu^e,  AftrU  Ath,  1837. 
Dear  Grassett, — I  ought  to  have  bejinin  "  Rev.  8i,j',"  as 
it  is  in  fact  an  ofiicial  communication  whicik  I  have  to  make,  but 
I  presume  that  you  can  charge  yourself  with  officially  ascertain- 
ing whether  the  cetitral  society,  if  I  may  so  call  it,  at  Toronto, 
for  proi&gt;agating,  &amp;c.,  will  be  disposed  to  undertake  the  expendi- 
ture of  the  funds  raised  in  England  by  the  Rev.  Mr.  Wadailove, 
and  to  pay  the  missiouaries  \vliom  he  has  sent  out,  or  may  con- 
tinue to  send  out  to  the  Bishop.  Upon  the  departure  of  the 
Bishop  of  Quebec  for  England  I  wrote  to  Mr.  W.  and  told  him 
that  I  did  not  expect  that  he  would  confide  to  me  the  distribu- 
tion of  his  funds,  as  he  had  confided  them  to  the  hands  of  his 
friend  the  Bishop  of  Quebec,  and  that  I  wished  these  mission- 
aries to  draw  directly  upon  himself — to  this  he  strongly  objects, 
as  tending  in  his  opinion  to  weahen  the  bond  of  connection  and 
dependence  which  ought  to  subsist  between  the  Bishop  and  the 
niissionaries  on  the  spot,  and  he  urges  the  expediency  of  making 
the  payments  either  through  me,  or  through  the  society  at 
Toronto  acting  in  concert  with  me.  All  that  I  should  wish  is 
that  when  any  fresh  arrangements  (for  engaging  new  missionaries, 
ur  augmenting  the  stipend  of  those  already  employed,  or  making 
up  deficiencies  under  any  particular  circumstances)  I  should 
have  communication  of  them  before  they  are  made  final. 

As  Mr.  Green  is  waiting  for  information  respecting  the 
source  to  which  he  is  to  look  m  future  for  his  payments,  and  I 
am  also  desirous  of  writing  as  soon  as  possible  to  Mr.  W.,  I  shall 
be  obliged  if  you  will  take  the  earliest  opportunity  to  bring  this 
matter  under  the  consideration  of  the  society.  It  will  of  course 
follow  that  the  location  of  any  additional  missionaries  sent  out

of  layinw  before  the  Mana&lt;T;in{r  Committee  of  the  Society  for

instructioiiw  from  the  Couiinitteo  to  offer  to  yourself  and  friends 
their  warnu  st  acknowled&lt;^Tients  for  tlie  valuable  assistance 
whidi  they  have  already  received  through  your  means,  and  to 
express  their  Avilliugnessito  co-operate  wit b  you  in  future,  by 
usiup;  their  best  endeavours,  in  conjunction  with  their  Tresident, 
the  I3ishop  of  the  Diocese,  to  apjily  faithfully  and  to  the  best 
advantage,  the  funds  you  may  be  enabled  to  place  from  time  to 
time  at  their  disposal. 

I  have  written  to  Mr.  Harpur  to  ascertain  what  balance 
will  be  due  to  him  at  the  close  of  the  present  year,  up  to  which 
period  the  allowance  was  pledged  to  him  by  tlie  late  lUshop  of 
Quebec,  from  the  Ui)per  Canadian  Travelling  Mission  Fund. 

I  have  also  written  to  Mr.  Green  to  a])prise  iiim  of  your 
wishes  that  he  should  receive  his  salary  in  sterling,  and  that 
this  arrangement  should  take  CiTect  from  the  date  of  his  appoint- 
ment. As  soon  as  the  amount  of  his  claim  shall  have  been 
ascertained  and  sanct'oned  by  the  Committee,  he  will  receive 
authority  to  draw  upon  the  Treasurer  for  the  amount. 

Owing  to  the  recent- disturbances  which  have  agitated  this 
province,  and  which  lia^'e  more  particularly  affected  this  city,  a 
meeting  of  the  Commiitoe  which  was  to  have  taken  place  early 
in  ihis  mouth,  has  been  unavoidably  postponed.  The  fact  is, 
that  on  the  /ery  day  when  the  Committee  were  to  have  assem- 
bled, the  city  was  on  the  point  of  being  attacked  by  the  insur- 
gents, and  every  gentleman  (Clergy  as  well  as  others)  capable 
of  bearing  arms,  was  engaged  in  militia  duty. 

We  trust,  by  God's  lilessing,  that  tranquillity  will  shortly 
be  restored,  and  hope  that  when  the  interruption  which  has 
been  put  to  matters  of  business  shall  have  ceased,  I  shiall  be 
able  to  send  you  a  statement  of  the  Treasurer's  accounts,  and 
furnish  yon  with  any  other  information  which  may  appear 
either  necessary  or  interesting  to  yourself  and  your  subscribers. 

I  remain.  Rev.  Sir,

Copi/  of  a  Subscription  Paper  now  drculating  in  Etif/land,  for  the  pur- 
pose of  aiding  the  Society  for  Converting  and  Civilizivg  the  Indiana, 
and  Propagating  the  Gospel  among  Destitute  Settlers  in  Upper  Canada. 

York,  Upper  Canada,  Ap 'il,  1833. 
The  Society  for  Converting  and  Civilizing  the  Indians,  and 
Propagating  the  Gospel  among  Destitute  Settlers  in  Upper 
Canada,  has  already  made  its  appeal  to  the  benevolence  of  the 
British  public.  During  the  summer  of  1831,  a  subscription  upon 
a  plan  similar  to  the  present  was  set  on  foot  by  the  Lord  Bishop 
of  Quebec,  and  discontinued  only  from  his  Lordship's  return  to 
his  diocese. 

Encouraged  by  the  favourable  light  in  which  the  objects  of 
the  Society  were  then  regarded,  and  the  pecuniary  aid  then 
placed  at  its  disposal,  the  Society  have  continued  to  suyjjort  a 
valuable  Mission  to  the  Indian  tribes  assembling  rft  the  Sault  St.

Mario,  between  the  liukes  Huron  and  Superior,  and  further 
ventured  on  the  estiiblinhinont  of  a  Mission  tor  the  benefit  of  a 
portion  of  the  Settlers  in  the  Upi)er  Province,  destitute  of  the 
outward  means  of  grace.  A  Clerfjfyman  appointed  to  this  Mission 
has  been  for  some  time  making  tlie  tour  of  one  of  the  twelve  dis- 
tricts into  which  the  U}&gt;per  Province  is  divided,  and  it  is  truly 
gratifying  to  find  from  his  reports  with  what  thankfulness  his 
visits  have  been  received,  and  how  earnestly  their  repetition  has 
been  implored  :  how  desirous  the  members  of  the  Clnirch  have 
shewn  theniselves  of  being  organized  under  his  direction,  of 
erecting  places  of  worship,  and  establishing  schools  for  religious 
instruction.  The  first  experiment  has  been  so  eminently  success- 
ful, as  regards  the  single  district  in  which  it  was  tried,  that  the 
Society  are  most  anxious  to  make  a  second,  could  they  bo  en- 
abled so  to  do  ;  and  they  are  persuaded  that  their  brethren  of 
England  could  not  confer  a  boon  more  inestimable  upon  the 
Destitu^v;  Settlors  wlio  are  members  of  the  Established  Church, 
than  that  of  assisting  to  effect  this  measure.  Should  this,  by  the 
Divine  blessing  and  their  generous  co-oi)eration,  be  accomplished, 
Ten  Districts  will  still  remain  to  be  supplied  ;  and  their  necessi- 
ties are  such  as  to  be  daily  crying  aloud  for  relief  to  the  Society, 
wJiose  resources  are  altogether  inadequate  to  respond  to  the  call, 
liOt  the  benevolent  friends  of  the  Establishment  at  home  consi- 
der how  great  a  tide  of  emigi-ation  is  setting  in  for  the  Canadas, 
how  many  of  their  communion  must  necessarily  be  carried  away 
with  it  to  these  shores,  and  in  penetrating  our  forests,  leave  be- 
hind them  the  blessed  ministrations  of  the  Cluu'ch  in  which  they 
have  been  nurtured.  Let  it  also  be  generally  borne  in  mind, 
how  the  Vonrable  Society  fur  the  Propa&lt;i&lt;itwn  of  the  (losjiel  in  Foreign 
J\irts  hare  been  crippled  in  their  noble  exertions  for  the  sjnritual  benefit  of 
the  Canadas,  by  the  icithdrarcal  of  the  imud  Parliamentary  Grant;  and 
to  how  »maU  a  degree  the  British  public  now  stands  charged  with  the  main- 
tenance  of  the  Church  in  this  Prorince.  Above  all,  let  it  be  remem- 
bered, that  for  want  of  proper  nourishment  in  its  infant  state,  the 
("huroh  of  Eugland  cannot  but  suffer  ii'remediably  in  all  the 
stages  of  its  future  growth.

It  may  perhaps  be  considered  in  some  measure,  that  these 
two  lists  are  an  unnecessary  addition  to  the  expence  of  the  book, 
but  as  tho  object  of  the  publication  was  the  (/nicral  benefit  of 
Canada,  rather  than  the  advantage  of  a  fund,  conducted  by  the 
labours  of  an  individual  ;  it  was  determined,  by  tho  advice  of 
friends,  that  the  lists  formed  a  fitting  part  of  the  plan,  in  order 
to  shew  that  a  desire  to  ameliorate  the  destitution  of  the  Emi- 
grants, pervaded  maui/  and  distant  parts  of  this  country. 

As  the  publication  of  "  the  Stewart  Missions"  is  at  the  general 
expence  of  "  tho  Upper  Canadian  Stewart  Travelling  Mission 
Fund" — and  for  the  advantage  of  the  purposes  of  that  Fund,  if 
any  advantage  arises  from  the  sale,  the  subscribers  to  the  book 
may  fairly  be  considered  to  that  amount,  subscribers  to  it, 
for  the  liberal  sui)port  which  the  intended  publication  has  re- 
ceived from  them,  in  a  great  measure  secures  the  Fund  from  any 
risk  of  ultin\ate  loss. 

In  presenting  this  book  to  the  public,  a  ta.sk  which  nothing 
but  his  deep  sense  of  tlio  necessity  of  the  case,  and  an  earnest 
desire  to  shew  that  the  destitution  of  Canada  is  not  chargeable 
upon  tho  memory  of  the  late  excellent  Bishop,  would  have  in- 
duced him  to  undertake,  (and  for  which  the  Editor  feels  his  own 
unfitness,  as  well  as  ho  knows  his  want  of  inclination  to  appear 
before  the  public  in  any  matter,)  he  regiu-ds  it  hi.s  duty  to  add  his 
most  grateful  thanks  for  tiie  unlookod  for  supi)ort  which  his  en- 
deavours to  aid  tho  late  estimable  Bishop,  have  received — and 
further,  he  considers  that  support  a  bond  upoL  him  for  the  utmost 
exertions  he  can  make,  and  trusts  that  while  ii'e  and  opportunity 
are  spared  to  him,  he  will  not  be  found  wanting,  in  the  .same 
holy  cause,  should  it  be  requisite  to  continue  the  publication 
of  the  (/anadian  Journals,  or  to  take  other  steps  for  awaken- 
ing public  attention  to  this  deeply  important  and  interesting 
subject.

LATKST  POSTCniPT,  RECEIVED  MAnC'H  27. 


Eiyhth  Letter  from  the  Ree.  Tho».  Green,  Steirart  TrareUing  Miisionart/, 

Loudon  District. 

Dated  Loudon,  V.  (\,  Feb.  19, 1830. 
Deau  Sin, — I  liavo  boon  prcvontitd  writing;  sooner,  having 
been  busily  employed,  in  addition  to  my  usual  labours,  making 
np  my  second  year's  journal  for  the  forthcoming  rejmrtofthe 
Toronto  Society.  I  consider  it  much  more  interesting  than  the 
last,  and  regret  there  was  not  time  to  send  it  to  you  for  "  Tho 
btewart  Missions."  It  comprises  a  greater  variety  of  incidents 
and  details — tho  labours  of  a  more  extended  mission.  I  send 
yon,  however,  tho  letter  of  remarks  with  Avhich  I  accompanied 
It,  as  it  gives  a  succinct  account  of  tho  wants  of  the  district, 
founded  upon  the  exjjerienco  of  tho  two  years.  And  I  will  send 
you  either  the  copy  of  tho  journal  now  at  Toronto,  or  tlie  nrinted 
copy,  the  first  o])portimity.  Since  my  last  communication  wo 
have  been  threatened  with  all  tlio  evils  of  a  foul  and  unnatural 
rebellion,  from  Avhichnot  our  foresight,  but  tlie  good  jjrovidenco 
of  God  rt/one,  delivered  us.  I  suppose  you  are  aware  that  the 
Home  and  London  Districts  were  the  only  disaffected  parts  of 
the  Upper  Province.  I  was  not  much  surprised,  as  from  per- 
sonal observation  in  the  various  parts  of  the  country  which  I 
visited  as  Travelling  JNIissionary,  I  can  ascribe  the  existing 
spirit  of  insubordination  simply  to  one.  cause — the  absolute  lack 
of  sound  scriptural  education,  and  faithful  preaching.  A  largo 
body  of  the  disallected  are  Universalists,  whose  teaching  may  ho 
truly  and  briefly  dt'scribed — blessed  aro  they  who  die  in  their 
sins,  and  whose  practice  in  tl»e  various  relations  of  life,  amj)ly 
verifies  this  to  be  their  doctrine,  I  believe  nearly  two-thirds  of 
the  prisoners  at  present  confined  in  the  jail  here  aro  connected 
with  this  most  unscrii)tural  body.  Not  a  few  also  of  tlie  Quakers 
of  Norwich  township  have  been  suspected  ;  and  very  many  j)ro- 
fe$sed  Baptists  have  been  found  arrayed  in  the  ranks  against  their 
Sovereign  Liege  f^ady  tlie  Queen.  I  am  happy  to  bo  able  to  say, 
that  as  far  as  1  can  learn,  (and  I  have  pretty  good  means)  tlio 
Weskn'an  Methodists  hero,  as  connected  with  tho  British  Wes- 
leyans,  have  all  rallied  on  the  side  of  order  and  good  government, 
and  I  am  alf^o  happy  to  say  that  J  know  nut  of  one  member  of  the  Chnrch 
of  England,  nor  have  7  heard  of  an  &gt;/,  where  my  i)ersonal  know- 
ledge does  not  extend,  being  detected  in  aiding  or  abetting  this 
uuTiatural  and  unwarrantable  outbreak  ;  but  it  can  be  alleged  of 
some  who  at  home  enjoyed  the  outward  means  of  grace  under 
her  shadow,  and  yet  since  their  settlement  in  tliis  country,  being 
deprived  of  any  stated  ministrations,  have  become  totally  indif- 
ferent to  any  and  every  form  of  Christian  worship.  May  this 
fact,  coming  under  the  notice  of  the  Home  Government,  be  in- 
strumental, under  Divine  Providence,  in  directing  their  thoughts 
more  pointedly  to  the  deplorably  destitute  condition  of  the  poor 
emigrants,  and  may  it  influence  them  speedily  to  make  more  ex- 
tensive and  proportionate  provision  for  the  maintenance  and 
spread  of  true  religioTi,  than  has  been  hitherto  aiForded.     For

some  weeks  in  various  parts  of  tlie  district,  so  great  was  tlio  ex- 
citement tha(  there  was  no  travelling  with  .safety,  and  in  tho 
few  places  wiiich  I  did  endeavour  to  visit  not  mauv  came  out  to 
hear  the  word.  Some  being  called  out  to  servo  in  the  militia, 
others  being  busily  occupied  in  chopping  wood,  in  order  to  leave 
a  supply  for  tlic^r  families,  daily  expecting  to  be  themselves  also 
called  out  for  service.  Althougli  great  excitement  still  prevails, 
I  hope  that  soon  wo  shall  be  cheered  again  with  tin;  blessing  of 
undisturbed  tranrpiillity.  Each  days  resitlence  in  this  country 
makes  the  spiritual  wants  more  apparent.  Home  tiiiu*  siiic(!  re- 
turning from  a  remote  part  of  the  township  of  London,  I  tra- 
velled with  a  person  who  had  been  for  some  years  ntsideiit  in 
this  country  ;  among  the  various  topics  of  onr  conversation,  (he 
advantage  to  be  derived  from  Wabbath  schools  and  Sabbath  {ser- 
vices was  introduced  ;  on  which  he  observed  "  In  our  i)art  wo 
"  have  no  service  on  the  day  of  rest,  and  it  gi-ieves  me  to  per- 
'*  cejve  tho  manner  in  which  Sunday  is  constantly  desecrated — 
"  tho  neighbours  indeed  assemble  in  each  other's  houses,  but  it 
"  is  only  to  talk  about  their  farms  and  such  like."  Hiving 
preached  the  other  da\  near  Missouri,  I  met  with  an  aged  fe- 
male from  Hull,  who  had  come  a  considerable  distance  to  atteiul 
divine  service.  I  iiupiired  how  long  she  had  Ikm'ii  in  thecounti  y  &lt; 
She  replied  nine  years,  and  then  mentioned  the  sad  privation 
she  and  her  family  laboured  under  in  the  total  absence  of  divine 
worship.  She  al.so  stated  that  \\\)u\\  one  occasion  the  son  of  one 
of  her  neighbours  came  to  her  uj)on  a  Tuesday,  asking  whether 
that  day  was  not  Sunday,  so  completely  was  the  retui-n  of  the 
Lord's  Day  forgotten  amongst  them,  owing  to  the  want  of  stated 
services.  It  is,  however,  cheering  to  witness  the  anxiety  wit- 
nessed in  many  instances  to  attend  the  means  of  grace,  when  of- 
fered to  them.  1  was  lately  driving  towards  tlie  Huron  tract, 
to  keep  an  appointment,  and  was  recognised  upon  the  way  by  a 
person  on  horsel&gt;ack  ;  having  enquired  the  place  and  the  hour 
at  which  I  intended  to  hold  divine  service,  he  at  once  relinquished 
the  obji'ct  of  his  ride,  althougli  within  a  short  distance  of  the 
l)lace  to  which  busine:iS  was  carrying  him,  and  accompanied  me 
back,  riding  nearly  ten  miles,  to  attend  the  ])ublic  worship  of 
(rod.  On  the  (ith  of  February,  the  day  of  thanksgiving  for  our 
deliverance  from  the  evils  of  rebellion,  I  lia&lt;l  two  services;  one 
in  the  town  in  the  morning,  the  other  in  the  evening,  at  some 
distance  in  the  country.  At  the  evening  service  it  issii|)j)posed 
there  were  not  less  than  five  hundred  present  ;  among  tlie  num- 
ber from  fifteen  to  twenty  Roman  Catholics.  It  must  be  grati- 
fying to  you  and  your  fiienus  to  iinow,  tliot  owing  to  your  send- 
ing out  a  missionary  into  this  section  of  the  wilderness,  so  many 
persons  were  afforded,  under  existing  ciii  uinstances,  an  oppor- 
tunity of  oftering  up  their  public  thanks  fur  the  mercies  vouch- 
safed to  them.  Yesterday  I  preached  the  funeral  sermon  of  an 
old  man  from  England,  who  I  trust  was  a  seal  to  my  ministry. 
He  and  his  family  attended  my  ])reaching  in  their  neighbour- 
hood, and  some  months  since  he  called  ujion  me  to  officiate  at 
the  interment  of  his  son,  wlio  died  after  a  very  short  illness.  1 
then  took  occasion  to  dwell  upon  the  instability  of  tempurul 
things,  and  the  necessity  and  advantage  of  having  our  treasure

my  desire  now,  is  tho  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and  thut  1  may  be  ac- 
cepted of  him," 

I  have  lately  visited  tho  township  of  Westminster,  wiiero  I 
find  several  families  attached  to  tlie  ("luireh — tlii'V  are  from 
Knj^land  and  Ireland— and  I  purpose,  I).  \' .  to  ludd  divine  ser-

plication as  one  for  an  iinmrdtafe  a^jmntiueut,  and  I  cannot  he  too 
grateful  for  his  kind  consideration  of  me,  but  it  n(&gt;ver  was  for  a 
moment  my  intention  to  relincpiish  the  charfj;e  in  which  the  late 
dear  liisho])  ])laced  mo,  until  my  enL;a,y;euient  with  you  and  your 
friends  had  terminated,  apprehending  that  by  so  doin^  J  mi^ht 
disappoint  or  inconvenience  you,  or  even  occasion  a  temporary 
Btop  in  the  "  Stewart  ^Mission."  Althou&lt;;h  under  present  eircum 
stances  a  fixed  mission  would  be  desirable,  (indeed  iinder  an 
any  circumstances  few  constitutions  could  stand  for  a  muc 
lonp^er  period  the  travelling  dtitios)  I  should  be  extremely  sorry 
that  the  Stewart  Mission  should  want  a  labourer,  and  thero.oro, 
(should  such  be  ynir  wish)  I  shall  not  abandon  my  post  until 
you  can  procure  one  suitable  to  your  own  views,  in  my  place — 
and  believe  me,  whatever  person  you  send  out,  I  shall  feel  to- 
wards him  as  a  brother,  and  shall  render  him  all  the  assistance 
in  my  power — and  hope  to  accompany  him  through  the  district 
in  his  first  general  circuit  over  the  field  of  his  future  labours.  I 
sincerely  pray  God  may  greatly  prosper  the  work  which  ho  led 
our  revered  Bishop  and  you  to  commence,  and  out  of  a  small  be- 
ginning cause  great  things  to  spring  forth.  I  shall  eo  Mr. 
Flood  m  a  f ew  days,  and  will  acrpiaint  him  with  you  wishes 
regarding  his  letters  ;  and  in  case  you  should  determine  here- 
after to  bring  out  a  second  volume,  you  may  rely  upon  it  that  if 
spared,  I  will  not  fail  (however  circumstanced)  to  collect  and 
transmit  to  you,  all  the  details  likely  to  be  useful  or  interesting 
which  fall  within  my  own  labours,  and  also  to  supply  you  with 
any  other  matter  I  can  glean. 

Since  I  finished  this  letter  our  excitement  has  begun  again, 
in  anticipation  of  an  attack  from  the  rebels,  joined  by  the  Ame- 
ricans. It  is  noAv  said  that  they  have  crossed  the  lines  in  the 
west,  at  Port  Sarnia — if  so,  we  may  look  for  a  march  direct  upon 
London.  There  are  five  hundred  of  our  regxdar  troops  at  Maiden, 
sixty  miles  fi'om  Sarnia,  with  a  few  pieces  of  artillery,  and  also  a 
large  body  of  volunteers.  ]May  the  Lord  avert  from  us  the 
horrors  of'^war  with  the  States,  but  it  is  now  spoken  of  as  in- 
evitable. I  remain,  dear  Sir,

Rev.  Sin,— III  compliance  with  your  request,  1  foiwurd  my 
journal  for  the  nocoiuI  your;  that  f«tr  the  previous,  endiii;^  in 
M»)vembtr,  UKKJ,  I  traii^niittcd  to  Mr.  Waddilove  Home  time

mouliis,  in  a('e(ir'ilan(.'(&gt;  with  th&lt;!  iiistnirtioiis  of  our  hile  valuiible 
and  lamruted  Diocesan,  1  ronlini'd  my  labours  to  i\\v.  south-east 
portion  of  tiie  district,  wliich  he  considered  in  ^rcati'r  need  of 
the  exertions  (tf  a  travelling;  missionary  tiian  tlie  western  town- 
ships, \\  liore  tliere  were  several  resident  (hT;^ynien  of  tlie  ('hureh. 
My  circuit  embraced  ^Val|lole,  Woodhouse,  Windham,  lUirford, 
Norwich,  Dereham,  Mi(hlleton,  Uayiiam,  and  occjisionally  Uain- 
ham.  'i"lirou;,'hout  these  townsliips  I  t'stablisiied  fourteen  mis- 
sion stations,  wliiclj  1  endeavoured  to  attend  punctually  every 
third  week,  in  the  fear  that  were  my  visits  less  freiiuent  and  re- 
^'ular,  the  conf&gt;;re;,'ations  J  had  forim-d  nni&gt;ht,  in  the  absence  of 
the  ministrations  of  our  Clmrcli,  unite  themselves  to  s«)me  of 
the  slrauj^ely  varyiiijj  dissentinir  bodies  around  them.  I  was  re- 
ceived in  every  place  with  the  {greatest  apj)arent  pleusuiv,  and 
many  warmly  ex])reHsed  their  delij,dit  in  the  ant:ei|»ation  of  once 
aijairi  enjoying  tiie  services  which  they  had  attendtrd  ami  loved 
in  tlieir  mother  land.  I  never  left  them  \ij)on  any  occasion 
without  receivinj;  the  most  urffcnt  invitations  to  return  as  soon 
and  as  frefpiently  as  my  engap^enients  in  other  townships  would 
admit. 

In  some  of  their  settlements,  many  who  had  been  a  loiij^ 
time  coimecteil  with  Dissenters,  entirely  owmg  to  the  want  of 
means  sui)plied  by  the  Church,  j)rofessed  their  willinj^ness  to 
return  to  her  fold,  and  more  than  once  was  1  assured  tiiat  never 
sliould  they  have  left  it,  had  they  only  been  favoured  with  a 
clergyman  to  resiil'  amongst  them  on  their  first  Koltlenient  in 
this  country. 

In  Butford  n«'&lt;l  Dereham  the  cont;rep^tions  are  most 
&lt;llM»irou'^  to  haverbui  hes  and  ii  inisters  in  then- respective  town- 
ItHips,  and  in  Norwich  they  have  testified  a  similar  anxiety,  not 
(  ,ily  b}' j)etiti  )nin&lt;f  tlu  Governor  in  Council,  to  have  a  clergy 
reserve,  secured  to  their  hojc  d  foi  pastor,  but  also  by  oft'ering 
sufficient  lumber  fur  the  erection  of  a  Church.  However,  though 
their  desires  ai'e,  I  am  sure,  sincere,  as  new  settlei  s  with  very 
limited  means,  tlu  .  can  do  but  little  to^N  irds  the  accomplish- 
ment of  their  wish.  \s  to  Sabbath  schoiils,  I  have  exerted  my- 
self much  to  establish  them  in  many  places,  but  I  regret  that 
hitherto  (chiefly  from  want  of  ■  itable  ■  'achers)  with  \  ery  im- 
perfect success,  except  in  the  h  vvnslii^is  of  London,  Tort  iiur- 
well,  and  Vienna.  In  the  two  latter  places  the  valuable  ser- 
vices of  Atr.  Kerr,  the  catechist,  as  superintendent,  have  been 
by  the  lm.J's  blessing,  rendered  ver\  edicient.  It  having  been 
intimati'U  t&lt;  me  from  the  Lerd  Bishop  of  Montreal,  a  short 
time  pv-vicus  to  Mr.  Ci'onyn  departure  for  Kngland,  that  1 
should  t  '  charge  of  the  London  congregations;  during  hi:,

year,  I  had  regularly  visite«l  and  officiated  every  third  week, 
and  also  from  the  number  of  new  appointments,  1  found  ic 
necessary  to  make  in  this  township,  and  tiiose  adjacent,  where 
the  peoi)le  came  out  in  numbers,  whenever  an  opportunity  was 
offered,  1  was  reluctantly  obliged,  in  some  measure,  to  relinquish 
attendance  on  the  more  remote  settlements,  Vienna  and  Port 
Burwell  included  ;  but  whenever  circumstances  permit,  I  still 
ride  over  to  visit  my  first  flocks.  I  have  distributed  some 
prayer  books  and  testaments,  and  also  several  hundred  of  tracts, 
supplied  to  me  by  the  Uj&gt;per  Canadian  Travelling  Mission 
Fund,  and  from  the  manner  in  which  these,  and  some  other 
little  works  of  my  own,  have  been  received,  1  am  led  to  think, 
that  I  might,  with  much  advantage  to  the  cause,  establish  a 
lending  library,  such  as  is  usually  attached  to  Sabbath  schools  at 
home.  I  regret  that  my  own  means  do  not  permit  my  extend- 
ing the  collection,  so  as  to  render  h  of  general  avail  through 
my  circuit. 

Since  my  location  here,  my  visits  have  extended  to  the  ad- 
jacent townships  of  Biddidph,  M'Gilivray,  Osborne,  and  Mis- 
souri, in  all  of  which,  I  am  sure,  from  my  own  experience,  and 
the  professions  of  the  people,  a  resident  clergyman  could  collect 
very  large  congregations  of  Church  families  ;  their  present 
spiritual  destitution  leaves  them  most  lamentably  open  to  the 
pernicious  and  anti-christian  doctrines  which  are  daily  and 
actively  disseminated  by  the  busy  agents  of  Satan. 

On  Mr.  Cronyn's  return,  (which  is  sjiortly  expected)  the 
Lord  permitting,  1  shall  again  resume  m}'  visits  in  the  field  of 
my  first  labours  ;  and  earnestly  do  I  long  for  the  time,  Avhen  the 
numerous  settlers  there,  will  not  be  dependent  on  my  poor 
services  alone,  but  may  enjoy  supplies  proportionate  to  their 
needs.  According  to  my  own  judgment,  I  shall  say  that  at  least 
seven  resident  ministers  could  find  ample  spheres  for  their  most 
zealous  labours  in  the  townships  Avhich  I  have  already  visited, 
were  they  placed  in  the  following  manner — one  at  Port  Burwell 
(where  there  is  a  neat  church  and  parsonage  house)  and  Vienna, 
both  in  the  township  of  Bayham,  one  at  Dereliam,  one  at  Nor- 
wich, one  at  liurford,  one  at  Walpole  and  Itainham,  one  at  Os- 
borne and  M'Gilivray,  one  at  Biddulph  and  Missouri,  two  in  the 
township  of  London,  In  the  above  arrangement  I  have  not 
included  the  tomi  of  London,  as  I  trust  that  ere  long  the  Lord 
maybe  pleased  to  restore  to  the  people  of  this  place  their  absent 
pastor  built  Tip  in  all  holiness,  and  more  tlian  ever  desirous  to 
devote  the  many  talents  with  which  his  Heavenly  Father  has 
endued  him  to  his  master's  glory.  Were  these  places  which  I 
have  named  favoured  with  the  fixed  ministrations  of  our  church, 
what  vast  tracts  of  this  immense  district  would  still  continue 
destitute  of  the  outward  means  of  grace,  M'ith  their  necessities 
constantly  increasing  from  the  constant  influx  of  emigrants. 
The  harvest  truly  is  great — may  the  great  head  of  the  church 
soon  send  forth  abundance  of  labourers. 

I  have  the  honour  to  remain, 
&amp;c.  &amp;c.  &amp;c.
