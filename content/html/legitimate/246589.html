My intellectual interest is in a broad field known as <a href="http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-stat/opre/opre640.htm#rrrefBefAction">Building Data-Driven Decision Support Systems</a>, that is, the well-focused consecutive thought process based on measurable and numerical scales to improve strategic decisions in the design, operation, and controlling complex man-made systems, such as an airport.

<P>
Models transform the managerial inputs into useful information for managerial decision. I received my higher-education degrees, all concentrated on modeling, from three different continents.  My first degree is in <font  color="#DC143C">Physics</font>, which deals with the modeling of nature; the second is in <font  color="#DC143C">Management Science</font>, which consists of modeling human activities in general.  Finally, my doctoral degree is in <font  color="#DC143C">General Operations Research</font>, which covers all aspects of modeling in every scientific field of studies. 
<p>
The growing trends in <font  color="#DC143C">interventional managerial decision-making</font> increasingly utilize applications of more than one technique and involve individuals from other disciplines. Moreover, they involve a blend of"hard" and "soft" as well as a mixing of different "hard" or"soft" techniques with the increasing use of multiple methods within one piece of analysis.  <font  color="#DC143C">A creative thinking</font> must look in detail at how those from disciplines outside of Operations Research can come to work in the organizations on multi-disciplinary studies. Those who have come from such backgrounds, clearly share their perspectives and experiences, by finding the scopes and limitations.
<p>
I am myself what is called an original thinker, my business being to question and test all the established decision sciences managerial tools to see how far they are still valid and how far worn out or superseded, and even to provide unifications, easy to understand, easy to implement and provide useful information for the managers. 
<p>
The decision making framework and tools often combine <a href="http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-stat/Refop.htm" target=new>optimization theory</a>, <a href="http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-stat/RefSim.htm" target=new>discrete event simulation</a>, and

For, example during recent years, competitive pressures and short product lifecycles have caused many manufacturing and retail companies to focus on supply chain management practices and applications. Continuing shifts in the geopolitical situation and emerging markets have opened up new business opportunities, and at the same time kept companies busy revising their supply chain structures, manufacturing locations, warehouse locations, inbound logistics, and distribution operations. This has led to an increased demand in strategic supply chain planning tools, such as
supply chain simulators and location optimization tools.

My <a href="#rrinstr">teaching</a>, <a href="#rrrintPub">research</a>, and <a href="#rrproServ">professional services</a> activities are multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and  
transdisciplinary which include: <font  color="#DC143C">General Optimization</font>, <font  color="#DC143C">Systems Simulation</font>, and <font  color="#DC143C">Statistical Data Analysis</font>. My journal publications on the above topics, show <a href="http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-stat/ReseachTable.pdf" target=new>consistency without any gaps</a>, not even a single year, since 1983; the year I joined the University of Baltimore and completion of my post-doctoral studies. As for my teaching ability, I am well known for teaching difficult concepts at appropriate levels that can be understood by my students.  My ability in humanizing the complex conceptual topics enables me to convey them in a clear simple language, therefore, become transparent for my students in an understandable way. My cardinal aim in constructing model-based decision support systems is to provide models for the managers which are easy to understand, easy to use, while providing useful managerial information.

<li><b>Students' Appreciations of Humanizing Difficult Concepts and Techniques:</b> I am well known and recognized for my ability in teaching difficult concepts and technical topics at a level meaningful, relevant to and easily understood by my students.  This ability is achieved over years by the means of humanizing the difficult concepts and technical topics. To implement this approach I often ask: Is it personally relevant and significant to my student? Is the student truly interested in the question? 
<p>
 My cardinal ability to humanize the technical and often difficult concepts is always appreciated by my students.  Recently I have received the following report from my dean: 
<blockquote>
Dr. Arsham,  
<dd>....I met with a class of graduate students to solicit feedback from them about the School and their education here. I didn't ask them to name names, but one student wished out loud that all Merrick School professors might be as great as Dr. Arsham in the classroom. That comment was heartwarming, and I really appreciate all the effort and positive results you bring to all of us.
 </blockquote>
<p>
The following letter sent to the administrators:
<p>
<blockquote>
Dear Dean,  
<p>
<dd>As an engineer pursuing my MBA, I found Dr. Arsham's course on Business
Statistics to be the most useful course I've taken to date at UB in bridging the gap between the technical world and that of the managerial.  Dr. Arsham is able to bring numbers and statistics alive and give them meaning.  As an instructor he is both disciplined and understanding of student needs.  While he is uncompromising in his method of teaching and rigorous in his treatment of the material, he is also most forgiving as I grew as a student under his tutelage.  In past courses I have never had difficulties with mathematics such as calculus or differential equations, but statistics and probability courses have always vexed me.  For the first time in my life, Dr. Arsham has enabled me to grasp the elusive meaning and mechanics of statistical analysis. At this point I can honestly say that a well-founded knowledge of basic statistics may be the most important class a business student should consider taking.  I HIGHLY recommend his course to any serious student who really wants to know how to analyze and understand statistics.

<blockquote>
"<b>Hossein Arsham</B>, Harry Wright Distinguished  Professor of Statistics and Management Science at the University of Baltimore. Arsham has amassed an outstanding record of publication. Most notably, he has done pioneering work that has enabled businesses to find 'exact' or desirable' solutions to problems with efficiency and enhanced speed in 'a single simulation run'. Since he joined the UB faculty, he has published more than 70 refereed articles and chapters on a host of topics in computational probability and statistics. During the last three years, he has published 28 journal articles and book chapters on discrete-event systems simulation, optimization with sensitivity analysis, and computational probability and statistics. His work has been cited in at least five books and at least 12 journal articles/book chapters. Arsham is currently the senior associate editor of Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, the official journal of the International Association of Statistical Computing, a section of the International Statistics Institute (one of the oldest scientific societies in the world); he has been an associate editor for the journal since 1989. Since 1997, he has been an associate editor of the Journal of Statistical Reasoning and an editor of both InterStat: Statistics on the Internet and the Journal of Interdisciplinary Mathematics. Arsham's accomplishments in research and scholarship have led to his selection for the Black and Decker Corporation Research Award for contributions to simulation and optimization. Additionally, he has been named a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, a Fellow of the Operational Research Society, and a Fellow of the Institute of Combinatorics and Its Applications.
