          <p align="center"><strong>Commentary by William B. Fox</strong><br>
          (2008 commentary) </p>
          <p align="justify"><strong> Jefferson today:<a name="Jefferson_today"></a> </strong>Thomas Jefferson acquired enough books in his personal library to 
          restock the Library of Congress after it was burned down by the British 
          during the War of 1812. Today that entire library could be loaded electronically 
          on a portable PC with just a few mouse clicks. We discuss the advantages of ebooks further in our <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/OtherToolbarTopics/Value_Proposition.html">value proposition </a> section. </p>
        <p align="justify">The founder of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson also exemplified 
          a genuine Faustian search for truth and knowledge. &quot;There is not 
          a truth which I fear or would wish unknown to the world.&quot;  We discuss why dissent is patriotic and why you should not be afraid to demonstrate and openly and freely search for truth in <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/OtherToolbarTopics/Our_Relevance.html">our relevance</a> section. <br>
                    <br>
          Lastly, Jefferson tried to be scientific. Similarly, we explain in our <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/Res_Opp_Ideol/Res_Opp_Ideol-1-Intro.html">resolving ideologies</a> section how we try to be analytical rather than dogmatic. We keep our minds open to  multiple perspectives. <br>
          <br>
          <strong><a name="Thankful"></a>Why should we still feel thankful and proud to be Americans?</strong><br>
          <br>
          At this web site we try to fearlessly explain a great many negatives suppressed by controlled national media. Nevertheless, it still it is very important to keep in mind the positives. Even if we succeed in convincing you that all the negatives we discuss are completely  true, if an individual becomes exclusively focused on negatives it can begin to run him down mentally and degrade his emotional and physical health. So let us  cheer ourselves up for a moment and look at the positives.<br>
          <br>
          America still has greater freedom of speech and right to personal expression than most other countries in the world, to include Canada and Britain.  This includes the right to speak out against Zionist criminality and irresponsible Holocaust exaggerations. To the best of my knowledge, people involved in the 9-11 Truth Movement and other dissident political activities have been free to publicly protest and demonstrate. Generally speaking, people still have the freedom to peacefully protest in public against the war in Iraq and the Bush Administration's contemplated war against Iran. We are still free to speak out against U.S. Government corruption and incompetence. We are also still free to go to the place of worship of our choice or  remain skeptical and uncommitted towards all religious and political ideologies.  We are also still free to choose our occupations and where we wish to live in America. <br>
          <br>
          The American political system still has tremendous mechanisms in place for peaceful grass roots political organizing to make a real difference. Probably one of the biggest causes of evil in America is simply public apathy at the grass roots level rather than sociopathic people at the top. <br>
          <br>
          The Achilles heal for the plutocrats and other so-called &quot;Establishment elitists&quot; (often a euphemism for &quot;Zionist neo-cons&quot;) involve political offices at the  state, county and local municipality levels. This includes local draft boards, county sheriffs, county judges, city government, and <a href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/TakeBackPrecincts-Jim-Condit.html">precinct panels</a> controlling local political parties.  <br>
          <br>
          As much money and national media smear power as the &quot;elitists&quot; have on a national level, it is still not enough to compromise everyone they need to buy off at the grass roots level to keep things completely under their control.  Two good sources for tips and tricks on grass roots organizing are <a href="http://www.realnews247.com/">Jim Condit, Jr.</a> and the &quot;Dynamite Redhead&quot; <a href="http://www.devvy.com/">Devvy Kidd</a>. (Please see my <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/Site_Map/Site_Map.html">site map</a> regarding their web sites as well as links involving other activists regarding various issues). <br>
          <br>
          America still has strong memories of libertarian traditions. The American Revolution was fundamentally a libertarian revolution. Despite the best efforts of enemies of freedom in America to continuously find sneaky, incremental ways to curtail our civil liberties, there still remains a strong public sentiment in favor of liberty. <br>
          <br>
          Although the white middle class has been steadily declining as a percentage of the total population, in absolute numbers America still has a white population roughly the size of England, Germany, France and some other white countries combined within its borders. <br>
          <br>
          As much as America has lost industrial infrastructure in the past few decades, it still has tremendous infrastructure in terms of sheer size and magnitude, to include tremendous research and development infrastructure in its major colleges and universities.<br>
          <br>
          As much as the American economy has become distorted away from the production of quality tradable goods and towards services in the past few decades, it is still has a significant percentage of the world economy.
          Americans still enjoy a high standard of living relative to most of the rest of the world.  <br>
          <br>
          The continental U.S. still encompasses tremendous natural resources. America is still a very big country with a lot of elbow room and enough different groups that one is bound to find like-minded people and support groups somewhere. <br>
          <br>
          Last, but not least, we still have a free Internet. And please let me emphasize: Thank God for the free Internet! This is probably one of the most important tools in the history of mankind to permit a true free market place of ideas. With a free Internet, we stand a good chance of evolving better ideas among men of good will to identify, sort out, and solve our problems in a rational and peaceful manner. <br>
          <br>
          All of this having been said, America's positives have been steadily eroding in the past few decades. They have become increasingly encumbered with &quot;caveats&quot; and &quot;exceptions&quot; that threaten to make us die the death of a thousand knife cuts, even if our political liberties and economic base are not yanked out from under us completely. <br>
          <br>
          I feel strongly that if we do not start working much harder right now at all levels to address and turn around deteriorative trends, the positives will eventually slip completely beyond our grasp. America will become overtaken and guided by the negatives. If we do not break the <a href="http://www.adelaideinstitute.org/LEGAL2006/kaminski.htm">mindlock</a> that shackles our nation, we will in fact be destroyed. <br>
          <br>
          So please do not allow my discussion of positives make you complacent. <br>
          <br>
          <strong><a name="business"></a>Why does white nationalism makes good long term business sense for American entrepreneurs as well as for big business?</strong> <br>
          <br>
          Up until they became invaded by massive waves of third world immigration following World War II, homogeneous northern European countries such as Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the Netherlands had the highest quality work forces in the world in terms of literacy, innovativeness, technological adaptiveness, and productivity. The organizational behavior problems of businesses are similar to those of countries on a much broader social scale. They require a certain level of ethnic and racial homogeneity and cohesion to sustain real economic growth and maintain a high level of productivity. Racial &quot;diversity&quot; actually increases various forms of internal strife. Affirmative action racial politics seriously undermine real meritocracy.<br>
          <br>
          On a very broad social level, the brand of  nationalism (or more accurately &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;) that I lean towards at this web site is very similar in concept to the  <a href="http://www.12manage.com/methods_7S.html">McKinsey 7-S framework</a> advocated by Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman, Jr. in their classic work <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Excellence-Thomas-J-Peters/dp/1861977166/sr=8-1/qid=1172544420/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6882161-6909565?ie=UTF8&s=books">In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America's Best-Run Companies</a></em>. They talk about the virtues of &quot;loose-tight&quot; management that encourages local initiative, and I talk about the importance of decentralized decision nodes and individual liberty. They talk about the need for &quot;shared values&quot; (which includes shared &quot;superordinate goals&quot;), and I talk about the need for shared racial and cultural identity.  They talk about how all the different &quot;7-S's&quot; have to pull together to create an effective business team,  and similarly I address how all the elements of popular sovereignty must come together in order for a people to survive and determine their own destiny. <br>
          <br>
          Selective forms of patriotism (&quot;jingoism&quot;) that focus on limited issues do not cut it any more, if ever they did. Conservatives must stay in the fight until all the key elements of popular sovereignty work together effectively. They must also be able to clearly identify their racial and ideological enemies. <br>
          <br>
          In the long run, it is far less costly to society and far more productive for businesses if they reinvest in a homogeneous society and maintain domestic control of their most vital manufacturing infrastructure than if they outsource industry and racially mix up their own work forces.  Homogeneous countries such as the aforementioned countries up until World War II were able to show steady economic advancement for centuries. In contrast, America's mania for racial &quot;diversity&quot; following the 1965 immigration reform act has only opened up tidal waves of illegal Third World immigration. Instead of promising centuries of stability and real progress looking forward, America's multi-racial, multi-cultural, globalist policies seem to be heading our increasingly bankrupt society towards a total disaster that may be only years, if not a decade or two away. Please note my discussion of deteriorating economic and social vital signs in my <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/Critical_Issues/Critical_Issues.html">Critical Issues</a> section. <br>
          <br>
          In regard to the Establishment's contempt for &quot;nationalism&quot; in the name of &quot;free trade,&quot; multi-culturalism,&quot; &quot;globalism&quot; and other modern liberal love objects,  just wait for the day when China decides to confiscate the remainder of America's investment in its manufacturing infrastructure.    (Please see my <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/Book_Preview_Pages/Townsend-Ralph/Ways_That_Are_Dark/Ways-3-Preface.html">Preface</a> to <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=8"><em>Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China</em></a>). Please also wait for Japan, China, and other countries that hold gigantic dollar reserves from America's out of control balance of trade deficits (resulting from a loss of competitive domestic industry that can make quality tradable goods) to decide to dump  their dollars and bond holdings and send America into a hyperinflationary spiral. <br>
          <br>
          In regard to the racial diversity trend which is causing the white population to steadily decline by about 1.5% a year as a percentage of America's total population, please see my <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/Book_Preview_Pages/chittum-thomas_w/Civil_War_II/CivilWarII-4-PublishersPreface.html">Preface</a> to <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=18"><em>Civil War Two: The Coming Breakup of America</em></a> by Tom Chittum. The current demographic trends do not paint a pretty picture, to say the least.  The ultimate end game of white dispossession can be seen today in South Africa, where one third of the white Afrikaner population, or about a million whites, <a href="http://africancrisis.co.za/Article.php?ID=17522&l">are now homeless, destitute, unemployable, and oppressed by black Marxists</a>. <br>
          <br>
            Lastly, please be clear that I am speaking about a<em> libertarian</em> 
            form of white nationalism that seeks to minimize government. This 
            is the &quot;genetic bottom up&quot; version I discuss in my &quot;<a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/Res_Opp_Ideol/Res_Opp_Ideol-1-Intro.html">Reconciling 
            Opposing Political and Economic Ideologies</a>&quot; series. This 
            was in fact the ideology of America's Founding Fathers. <br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately today many libertarians, such as certain anarcho-libertarian lecturers at the Mises Institute (<a href="http://www.mises.org/">www.mises.org</a>), tend to use the term &quot;nationalism&quot; in a negative sense. They connote an authoritarian, statist, socialistic version that encourages corrupt crony capitalism.  Many of them will not even go near white racial issues, much less connect the words &quot;white racial&quot; with &quot;nationalism.&quot; Some of them are scared to death of being called &quot;racists&quot; and might even turn white and faint on the floor if labeled  &quot;anti-semitic.&quot; <br>
          <br>
            This is unfortunate because many Mises Institute lecturers make quite 
            a few very excellent points across a wide variety of topics. In fact, 
            I have listened to just about all of their <a href="http://www.mises.org/media.aspx">archived 
            lectures</a> and recommend them, subject to my aforementioned reservations. 
            However, here at America First Books we feel compelled to summon internal 
            fortitude and confront the really hard issues. The ultimate issues 
            involve hard realities <em>that must be confronted</em> head on if 
            we are to ever return to sustainable prosperity. <br>
          <br>
          Early Americans prospered from a libertarian version of white racial nationalism that was also known as 19th century classical liberalism (not to be mistaken with &quot;modern liberalism,&quot; which is often the opposite on many important issues.).  In the long run, this can simultaneously minimize the harmful effects of government intervention, guard against alien subversion, and preserve the underlying cultural and genetic integrity of ones society.  In the long run this approach can also help make America a more viable, more productive, more secure, and more humane country in its relationships with other nations around the world than the fraudulent policies advocated by modern liberals. Far from being irrelevant, this viewpoint is now more timely than ever given growing evidence of massive system dysfunction and increasing breakdown in America today.<br>
          <br>
          Just because the King and his <em>treasonous</em> Establishment compatriots   wear no clothes does not mean that you have to remain intellectually naked or look foolish as well. (For more on the real underlying nature of the &quot;treason&quot; please see <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=17"><em>Final Judgment</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=10"><em>The High Priests of War, </em></a><em><a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=12">Dirty Secrets</a>, <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=16">The Judas Goats</a>, </em>and<em> <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=15">The Viper's Venom</a></em>).

        <blockquote>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Since I  entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some  of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and  manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that  there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so  interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above  their breath when they speak in condemnation of it&hellip;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great  industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit  is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our  activities are in the hands of a few men. . . <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [W]e have come to be one of the  worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated, governments  in the civilized world &mdash; no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a  government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the  opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men&hellip;&rdquo;<strong> </strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="justify">According to the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Woodrow_Wilson">Wilson Wikiquotes</a> (as of 19 Nov 2006), these quotes come from <strong><em>The New  Freedom: A Call for the Emancipation&nbsp;of the Generous Energies of a People</em> </strong>(New York and Garden City: Doubleday, Page &amp; Company,  1913): <br>

          The current George Bush administration has done an incredible job of alienating not only artists, but also serious intellectuals and independent thinkers on both the left as well as right. As an example coming from the left, Gore Vidal commented in &quot;<a href="http://www.truthdig.com/dig/item/20060207_president_jonah_redux/">President Jonah Redux</a>&quot;:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p align="justify"> ...under the &lsquo;boy emperor&rsquo; George W. Bush (as Chalmers Johnson refers to him), we have entered the Dark Ages in earnest, pursuing a short-sighted path that can only accelerate our decline. For what we are now seeing are the obvious characteristics of the West after the fall of Rome: the triumph of religion over reason; the atrophy of education and critical thinking; the integration of religion, the state, and the apparatus of torture &mdash; a troika that was for Voltaire the central horror of the pre-Enlightenment world; and the political and economic marginalization of our culture&hellip;. The British historian Charles Freeman published an extended discussion of the transition that took place during the late Roman empire, the title of which could serve as a capsule summary of our current president: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400033802/qid=1138063412/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?n=507846&s=books&v=glance&tag2=truthdig-20">The Closing of the Western Mind</a>.&quot; </p>

        <p align="justify"><strong>The international nationalist concept<a name="The_international_nationalist_concept"></a>:</strong> This  is important because it provides an ideological formula that enables countries to grow strong from within while maintaining peaceful and mutually supportive trade relationships with their neighbors. A policy that promotes free enterprise, individual liberty, and internal development of science, technology, and industry, while simultaneously avoiding imperial growth and foreign entanglements (viewed as ultimately destructive to individual liberty) is usually identified with what is known as 19th century classical liberalism. <br>
              <br>
          We support nationalists everywhere, provided that they adhere to classical 
          liberal principles. We believe that charity must begin at home, and 
          that people must first get their own houses in order before they can 
          become good neighbors to others. We also believe that human communities 
          are biological entities that require a certain minimal level of ethno-racial 
          rootedness, cohesion, cultural coherence, identity, and altruistic self-reinvestment 
          in order to function in a healthy and productive capacity. <br>
                    <br>
          Therefore, 
          in regard to those who share our principles, we also support Canada 
          First, Ireland First, Britain First, Norway First, France First, Ukraine 
          First, Russia First, Japan First...perhaps you now get the picture.

                    <strong>Acting normal<a name="Acting_normal"></a>:</strong> Let us try to answer this question by posing two others:<br>
                    <br>
          Question 1: What should one do if one is very healthy and physically
          fit? Answer: Continue to eat right and stay on an appropriate exercise
          program.<br>
                    <br>
          Question 2: What should one do if one is extremely obese and malnourished?
          Answer: Eat right and get on an appropriate exercise program. Only one has to be more conscious of the problem and more determined about executing a plan to get healthy again.. </p>
        <p align="justify">A likely learning point here: There are positive goals we should
          remain focused on regardless of current conditions. It is often healthier
          to remain focused on positive goals than to define oneself simply by
          reacting to negatives.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now let me get to the political punch line. <br>
              <br>
          Question 1: What do people tend to do if they have a wise, benevolent government that guarantees individual liberty?  Answer:  They tend to  grow more prosperous and become more empowered on a local level.<br>
          <br>
          Question 2: What should one do if one has a government that is becoming an intolerable tyranny? Answer: One should continue to try to remain empowered and organize on a local level, even if it means forming a nation within a nation to defend  common interests that opposes the tyranny of the central government. This local grass roots organization and empowerment is a necessary prerequisite before any other actions become feasible to defy tyranny. Only one has to be more conscious of the problem and more determined about executing a plan to get healthy again. </p>

I talk about depleted uranium, runaway government, and other pressing matters in my <a href="http://www.amfirstbooks.com/IntroPages/ToolBarTopics/Critical_Issues/Critical_Issues.html">Critical Issues</a> section. <br>

          In regard to American history, please see Gary North's article &quot;<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north520.html">Monsters, Limited</a>.&quot; See also the &quot;<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig2/lincoln-arch.html">King Lincoln</a>&quot; archive at <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/">lewrockwell.com</a>. This is barely getting warmed up. <br>

          In regard to economics,  we strongly agree with the &quot;Perfect 
          Storm&quot; scenario espoused by such financial pundits as <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/transcriptions/Faber2005.html">Dr. 
            Marc Faber</a>, <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/oldupdates/main.htm">James 
              Puplava</a>, and <a href="http://www.jimrogers.com/">Jim Rogers</a>. 
          At the rate in which America's overall debt is <a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/nat-debt/debt-nat-a.htm">galloping 
            out of contro</a>l, combined with its structural inability to halt its 
          chronic balance of trade imbalances or reverse its decline in domestic 
          manufacturing, we are very likely headed towards a <a href="http://www.mises.org/story/890">hyperinflationary 
            depression</a>, perhaps more severe and convulsive than <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A15438-2003Aug2?language=printer">the 
              crisis</a> which left <a href="http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1472">half 
                the Argentinean population</a> in poverty in the 2001-2003 time frame.

        <p align="justify">How could America have maneuvered itself into such a horrible situation?
          What measures should Americans take on an individual, community, and
          national
          level
          to survive and get out of this mess?</p>
        <p align="justify">A major purpose of this ebook store is to provide realistic background
          on the basic &quot;who, what, where, why, and hows&quot; behind trends which
          ultimately
          effect your life as well as offer
          constructive strategies looking forward.</p>
        <p align="justify"> Over time we would like to expand our offerings of intellectual treasures
          currently gathering dust in the back stacks of college libraries that
          reflect a wide variety of viewpoints regarding such areas as politics,
          economics, anthropology, religion, science, technology, history, home
          schooling materials, nutrition,
          health and fitness. We would also like
          to provide a forum for intellectually honest authors who are being
          unfairly
          suppressed
          or ignored by arrogant, abusive,  corrupt, or anti-First Amendment
          mainstream media. <br>
          <br>
          Come hell or high water, we would like to remain a home port for seriously analytical contrarian thinking, and in particular for full metal jacket paleoconservative commentary.<br>
