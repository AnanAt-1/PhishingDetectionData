<h1>Ultimate webalizer.conf Project</h1>
The goal of the project is to create the ultimate webalizer.conf file.  
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">The Webalizer</a> is a fast, free web server log file analysis program. It produces highly detailed, easily configurable usage reports in HTML format, for viewing with a standard web browser. 
<br>

<a href="http://github.com/human39/webalizer-conf">Now at github!</a>
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> This webalizer.conf file relies on heavy usage on the Group* and Hide* configuration options.<br>
The following statement is included in webalizer's README file under "Known Issues":
<pre>
 o Performance.  The Hide*, Group*, Ignore*, Include*  and IndexAlias
    configuration options can cause a performance decrease if lots of
    them are used.  The reason for this is that every log record must
    be scanned for each item in each list.  For example, if you are
    Hiding 20 objects, Grouping 20 more, and Ignoring 5,  each record
    is scanned, at most, 46 times (20+20+5 + an IndexAlias scan).
    On really large log files, this can have a profound impact.  It
    is recommended that you use the least amount of these configuration
    options that you can, as it will greatly improve performance.
</pre>
In short, if you have a slow machine you might not want to use this file.
<br><br>
For example this is the output of when I run the current webalizer.conf against my 81 Meg test file.
<pre>
    453323 records in 547.01 seconds, 828/sec
