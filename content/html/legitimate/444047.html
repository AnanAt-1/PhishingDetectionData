 <p>Well, well, well. An <font face="arial, geneva">update of sorts!

There's a different cover for the two formats as well, and a couple tiny changes fromt he version we probably burned off for you back in 2001 or whenever. In fact, here are a couple of pics (LP, CD):</font></p>

What else, what else? </font>OH, we might be playing a show sometime in the future too<font face="arial, geneva">, you know -- to celebrate the record finally coming out &amp; all that.
