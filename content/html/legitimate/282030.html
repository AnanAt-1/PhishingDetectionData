<B>A brief overview of the story:</B><BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>
</P>

You have to take the young magician-apprentice Tomjohn Spellbush around the colourful world of Sedemihcra. Dismissed by his teacher Tarek because of incapacity, he is on his way to find a new master to finish his studies and finally to become a real magician. The story takes place in Ringvalley, a small valley in a country called Ardatia, one of the biggest countries in Sedemihcra. Magic is not unknown here, but it might be difficult to gain knowledge sometimes ...<BR>
