<p>In 1997, Voltaire wrote and illustrated the six-issue <a href="../Sirius_Entertainment/" title="Sirius Entertainment is an American comic book company that operated from 1994 to.">Sirius Entertainment</a> comic book series <i>Chi-Chian</i>, and created a <a href="../Flash_animated/" title="Flash animation is an animation that is created with the Adobe Animate platform or similar animation software and often ...">Flash animated</a> webseries of the same name for the <a href="../Sci-Fi_Channel/" title="Syfy is an American basic cable television channel, owned by the NBCUniversal Media Group division and business segment of ...">Sci-Fi Channel</a> website.<sup><a href="#Ref-6">[6]</a></sup> He also authored the graphic novel <i>Oh My Goth!</i> (2002), and has written such books as <i>What Is Goth?</i> (2004) and <i>Paint It Black: A Guide to Gothic Homemaking</i> (2005). The latter book led to a <a href="../YouTube/" title="YouTube is an American social media and online video sharing platform owned by Google.">YouTube</a> webseries titled <i>Gothic Homemaking</i>, in which Voltaire shares information related to gothic <a href="../homemaking/" title="Homemaking is mainly an American and Canadian term for the management of a home, otherwise known as housework, housekeeping, ...">homemaking</a> and decor.</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>In the past, when asked about his real name, Voltaire avoided the question or implied that his real name is in fact Voltaire.<sup><a href="#Ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Voltaire chose to use his middle name as his performance name because his namesake "saw through the hypocrisies of humanity and commented on them through satire. In essence, he was able to educate people about the world around them by making them laugh."<sup><a href="#Ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the <a href="../School_of_Visual_Arts/" title="The School of Visual Arts is a private for-profit art school in New York City.">School of Visual Arts</a> where he is employed as an instructor, Aurelio Voltaire's real name is Aurelio Voltaire Hernández.<sup><a href="#Ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Starting with his 2011 album, <i>Riding a Black Unicorn...</i>, Voltaire added his first name to his stage name, changing it to "Aurelio Voltaire" for the following reason: "I got tired of there being other people releasing albums as Voltaire. There's an indie band in Germany and some American guy who makes instrumental hip hop. Like, do these people not do a fuckin' Google search before naming their bands? Anyway, it was just easier to distinguish myself from them by using my first name."<sup><a href="#Ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Aurelio Voltaire's father died when he was four months old. At ten months old, Voltaire emigrated to New Jersey with his mother and sister after his mother remarried. However, he did not enjoy residing there, stating he was a victim of bullying because of his heritage and strange hobbies and interests.<sup><a href="#Ref-2">[2]</a></sup> At the age of ten, Voltaire was inspired by the films of <a href="../Ray_Harryhausen/">Ray Harryhausen</a> (<i><a href="../Jason_and_the_Argonauts_(1963_film)/" title="Jason and the Argonauts is a 1963 epic independent fantasy adventure film distributed by Columbia Pictures.">Jason and the Argonauts</a></i>, <i><a href="../The_7th_Voyage_of_Sinbad/" title="The The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is a 1958 American Technicolor heroic fantasy adventure film directed by Nathan H.">The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</a></i>), and began animating on a <a href="../Super_8_mm_film/">super 8</a> camera. By piecing together snippets of information from fanzines, he eventually was able to teach himself how to make foam rubber animation models and animate them. His stepfather was abusive, considering Voltaire's strange hobbies and interests to indicate he was homosexual. A family friend sexually molested him from infancy into his teenage years. His girlfriend at the time committed suicide, which made him consider doing the same. Before he followed through, he promised himself to live one more day, doing and saying what he wanted to do and say. This allowed him to stand up to the people who were bullying him, and instantly elevated his self-esteem. At the age of 17, he ran away from home and moved to New York City. His first job there was an animator with <a href="../Parker_Brothers/" title="Parker Brothers was an American toy and game manufacturer which in 1991 became a brand of Hasbro.">Parker Brothers</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-11">[11]</a></sup> Voltaire says that he loves New York, and that the only other place he would be happy living is Tokyo.<sup><a href="#Ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Musical style and career</h2>
<p>Voltaire's music has strong roots and connections to European <a href="../folk_music/" title="Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former ...">folk</a> as well as other influences such as the <a href="../Gothic_rock/" title="Gothic rock is a style of rock music that emerged from post-punk in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s.">goth scene</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-11">[11]</a></sup> However, many listeners find his music hard to classify. Although it has a sound reminiscent of European folk music,<sup><a href="#Ref-11">[11]</a></sup> many people claim it to be <a href="../dark_wave/" title="Dark wave is not considered an &quot;unified genre but rather an umbrella term&quot; that encompasses a variety of musical styles, ...">dark wave</a>; perhaps as this is a label often given to many other artists from <a href="../Projekt_Records/" title="Projekt Records is an independent record label established by Sam Rosenthal in 1983, the label focuses on darkwave, ...">Projekt Records</a>, and a word often used to mean many things by the label themselves.<sup><a href="#Ref-12">[12]</a></sup> His music has also been linked to cabaret, with <i>Lexicon Magazine</i> using the term "goth cabaret", possibly referring to <a href="../dark_cabaret/" title="Dark cabaret is a music genre that draws on the aesthetics of burlesque, vaudeville and Weimar-era cabaret, generally played ...">dark cabaret</a>, a term often used to describe some bands Voltaire cites as his influences.

It was not until later that he began participating in the goth scene; it did not at first occur to him that there was a goth scene at all.<sup><a href="#Ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>On September 25, 2013, Voltaire announced on his official blog, that he and his wife were to be divorced. Saying, "On October 1st of this year, my wife and I would be celebrating our 4th year wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, it's not to be. After nearly four years of marriage and a couple more of dating, we are parting ways. It saddens me so deeply that things didn't work out. It's been a difficult process for both of us to come to this decision, one that I really don't wish upon anyone. Nothing is worse than seeing your best friend in pain."<sup><a href="#Ref-29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>As of 2022, he is currently engaged to Mexican-Japanese singer, <i>Mayumi Toyoda,</i> <sup><a href="#Ref-30">[30]</a></sup></p>
