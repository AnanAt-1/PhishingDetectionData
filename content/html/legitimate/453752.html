<H2>History</H2>
It was the original monastery of the Geluk&nbsp;order, founded by Je Tsongkhapa&nbsp;himself in 1409, and traditionally considered to be the seat of Geluk administrative and political power.

He is identical with the respective abbot of Ganden Monastery...</div><br></span>&nbsp;or 'throne-holder of Ganden' is the head of the Gelukpa school.<br />
<br />
Tsongkhapa's preserved body was entombed there in a silver and gold encrusted tomb by his disciples in 1419.<br />
<br />
Being the farthest from Lhasa of the three university monasteries, Ganden traditionally had a smaller population with some 6,000 monks in the early 20th century (although Waddell reports an estimate of about 3,300 in the 1890s and there were, apparently only 2,000 in 1959. At this time there are about 170 monks.<br />
<br />
Ganden Monastery consisted of two principal original colleges, Jangtse and Shartse, meaning North Peak and East Peak respectively. The three main sights in the Ganden Monastery are the Serdung, which contains the tomb of Tsongkhapa, the Tsokchen Assembly Hall and the Ngam Cho Khang the chapel where Tsongkhapa traditionally taught.  The monastery houses artifacts which belonged to Tsongkhapa.<br />
<br />
It contained more than two dozen major chapels with large Buddha statues. The largest chapel was capable of seating 3,500 monks. Tenzin Gyatso, the present Dalai Lama (born 1935), took his final degree examination in Ganden in 1958 and he claims to feel a particularly close connection with Tsongkhapa.<br />
<H2>Destruction in 1959 and 1966 and reconstruction efforts</H2>
Ganden Monastery was completely destroyed during the rebellion of 1959. In 1966 it was severely shelled by <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("18130",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("18130")' href="/topics/Red_Guards_(China)">Red Guard</a><span class="hp" id="m18130"><div class="hpHeader">Red Guards (China)</div><div class="hpContent">Red Guards  were a mass movement of civilians, mostly students and other young people in the People's Republic of China , who were mobilized by Mao Zedong in  1966 and 1967, during the Cultural Revolution.-Origins:...</div><br></span>&nbsp;artillery and monks then had to dismantle the remains. Most of Tsongkhapa's mummified body was burned but his skull and some ashes were saved from the fire by Bomi Rinpoche, the monk who had been forced to carry the body to the fire. Re-building has been continuing since the 1980s and the "red-painted lhakang in the centre is the reconstruction of Ganden's <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> containing Tsongkapa's reliquary chorten&nbsp;called the Tongwa Donden, 'Meaningful to Behold.'<br />
