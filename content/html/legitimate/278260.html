Okay these are just some sample shots, they are not meant to be complete.
I really haven't had time to work on these at all but hopefully I'll have some 
new things to show soon.
You should also probably check out

Andreas Dilgers</a> combination of the penguin and the logo that seemed
to be doing best from the 
<a href="http://www.cs.earlham.edu/~jeremiah/linux-pix/linux-logo.html">
Linux logo competition</a>.  Andreas has done some really excellent work.

penguin and Matt Ericson's Linux 2.0 text.  
Matt has done a couple of integrated logos himself now, You should definitely check them out at Matt's <a href="http://www.webgeeks.com/linux-logo/">linux-logo page</a>
