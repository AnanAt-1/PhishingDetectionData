<h1>Mid vowel explained</h1>
<p>pronounced as /vowels/pronounced as /notice/A <b>mid vowel</b> (or a <b>true-mid vowel</b>) is any in a class of <a href="../vowel/" title="Vowel is a speech sound pronounced without any stricture in the vocal tract, forming the nucleus of a syllable.">vowel</a> sounds used in some spoken <a href="../language/" title="Language is a structured system of communication that consists of grammar and vocabulary.">language</a>s. The defining characteristic of a mid vowel is that the tongue is positioned approximately midway between an <a href="../open_vowel/" title="An open vowel is a vowel sound in which the tongue is positioned approximately as far as possible from the roof of the mouth.">open vowel</a> and a <a href="../close_vowel/" title="Close vowel is that the tongue is positioned approximately as close as possible to the roof of the mouth as it can be ...">close vowel</a>.</p>
<p>Other names for a mid vowel are <b>lowered close-mid vowel</b> and <b>raised open-mid vowel</b>, though the former phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as low as <a href="../Open-mid_vowel/" title="An open-mid vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken language s.">open-mid</a>; likewise, the latter phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as high as <a href="../Close-mid_vowel/" title="A close-mid vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken language s.">close-mid</a>.</p>
<h2>Vowels</h2>
<p>The only mid vowel with a dedicated symbol in the <a href="../International_Phonetic_Alphabet/" title="The International Phonetic Alphabet is an alphabet ic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin script.">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> is the <a href="../mid_central_vowel/" title="The mid central vowel is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken language s.">mid central vowel</a> with ambiguous rounding pronounced as /[ə]/.</p>
<p>The IPA divides the vowel space into thirds, with the <a href="../close-mid_vowel/" title="A close-mid vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken language s.">close-mid vowel</a>s such as pronounced as /[e]/ or pronounced as /[o]/ and the <a href="../open-mid_vowel/" title="An open-mid vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken language s.">open-mid vowel</a>s such as pronounced as /[ɛ]/ or pronounced as /[ɔ]/ equidistant in <a href="../formant/" title="Formant is the broad spectral maximum that results from an acoustic resonance of the human vocal tract.">formant</a> space between open pronounced as /[a]/ or pronounced as /[ɒ]/ and close pronounced as /[i]/ or pronounced as /[u]/. Thus a true mid front unrounded vowel can be transcribed as either a lowered (IPA|e̞) (with a lowering diacritic) or as a raised (IPA|ɛ̝) (with a raising diacritic).<sup><a href="#Ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Typical truly mid vowels are thus:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../mid_front_unrounded_vowel/" title="The mid front unrounded vowel is a type of vowel sound that is used in some spoken language s.">mid front unrounded vowel</a> pronounced as /[e̞]/ or pronounced as /[ɛ̝]/</li>
<li><a href="../mid_front_rounded_vowel/" title="The mid front rounded vowel is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages.">mid front rounded vowel</a> pronounced as /[ø̞]/ or pronounced as /[œ̝]/</li>
<li>mid central unrounded vowel pronounced as /[ɘ̞]/ or pronounced as /[ɜ̝]/ (most commonly written (IPA|ə))</li>
<li>mid central protruded vowel pronounced as /[ɵ̞]/ or pronounced as /[ɞ̝]/ (most commonly written (IPA|ɵ) as if it were <a href="../close-mid_vowel/" title="A close-mid vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken language s.">close-mid</a>)</li>
<li>mid central compressed vowel pronounced as /[əᵝ]/</li>
<li><a href="../mid_back_unrounded_vowel/" title="The mid back unrounded vowel is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken language s.">mid back unrounded vowel</a> pronounced as /[ɤ̞]/ or pronounced as /[ʌ̝]/</li>
<li><a href="../mid_back_rounded_vowel/" title="The mid back rounded vowel is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken language s.">mid back rounded vowel</a> pronounced as /[o̞]/ or pronounced as /[ɔ̝]/</li>
</ul>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>Few languages contrast all three heights of mid vowel, because it is rare for a language to distinguish more than four heights of true front or back vowels.</p>
<p>The <a href="../Kensiu_language/">Kensiu language</a> spoken in Malaysia and Thailand is highly unusual in that it phonemically contrasts true-mid vowels with close-mid and open-mid vowels without differences in other parameters such as backness or roundedness.</p>
