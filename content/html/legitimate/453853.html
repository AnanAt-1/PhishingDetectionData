The shootout was one of several rule changes made in 2005, as the league attempted to open the game up after the lockout.  One of the most controversial changes was the league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction penalties.  The league hoped that the game could be opened up if it cracked down on "clutching and grabbing".  The tighter regulations have met with numerous complaints about the legitimacy of some calls, that players are diving to draw penalties, and that officials are not calling enough penalties. The changes initially led to a sharp increase in scoring.  Teams combined to score 6.1&nbsp;goals per game in 2005–06, more than a full goal per game higher than in the 2003–04 season.  This represented the highest increase in offence since 1929–30.  However, scoring has rapidly declined since, approaching pre-lockout totals in 2007–08.<br />
