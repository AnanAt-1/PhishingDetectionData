<H2>After the season</H2>
First-year Head Coach Solich was new to the job title but still in his element, after having served as an assistant in varying capacities with Nebraska since 1975., Solich completed his inaugural season with a final record of 9-4 (5-3), after having lost much of the 1997 national championship team's talent to graduation.  Nonetheless, Nebraska finished tied for 2nd place in the Big 12 North Division, and tied for 4th conference-wide.<br />
<br />
The season was concluded by #14 Nebraska falling to #5 Arizona 20-23 at the Holiday Bowl.<br />
