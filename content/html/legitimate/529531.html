                    <p>For an absolutely crazy banger of a site, OhHell.com is one of those sites that never ceases to amaze you. It has an abundance of some seriously crazy shit that is seriously out there, and obviously, we at WTF.PORN don't like to kink shame or any of that stupid-ass backwards shit, but when I say that they have some crazy shit I really do mean it... it's not that I don't enjoy some shitty East Asian tranny porn here and there, or that I don't look at those mass-produced porn videos from sites like Brazzers where you get the cock-and-balls every 10 seconds, but it's the former shit, and not the latter that OhHell.com excels at, and that's why we HAD to recommend this site to you. It's the good kind of shit, and while they probably do have scat porn (lol) I can't say I went and searched for it or anything like that, I keep myself to a certain amount of fetishes and can't enjoy every kink out there... But, like I said, OhHell.com gets a 10 out of 10 from us. Visit it. Use it. Recommend it.</p>

                        <h3>GO.PORN<br></h3></a>
                    <p>I think one of the main reasons why I like GO.PORN is because it's such a good site to get your rocks off, and it does have some good shit from anal porn, to the more serious stuff like massively-produced fisting porn videos, which will probably not be everyone's cup of tea, but if your favorite pornstar is starring in it, who cares? It's not like you're fapping to some third-world country shit. The faps that are to be had on GO.PORN will be 100% halal and kosher friendly. Everything is just top notch over there, and the ads are honestly quite fine for a free porn site, so it gets some serious points from me on that, and I just can't seem to stop finding some older professionally produced videos from my favorite now-retired pornstars, so I will be coming back to GO.PORN.... Like, all of the time... it's just too good not to, and even though I'm generally into some weird shit, I think the halal faps are the best faps, so... GO.PORN is my favorite, and even though kinksters are going to hate me for saying that; Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.</p>

                    <p>Man, Smutr was my go to shit when it came to fapping to my favorite webcam models from sites such as MyFreeCams and Chaturbate. It's just nuts how much webcam shit this site has, and it has stuff going back years upon years... and it has hundreds of videos of your favorite webcam models, like truly extensive, and quite frankly -- autistic-like libraries of content that only hoarders would be able to amass and then share for free with the masses. There's not much else to say about Smutr other than that it's an extremely old... Fuck, ancient site and basically a part of the Internet history, and it's the keeper of all that good stuff like what I was talking about... all those cam girls that you fawned over years ago, and all those amateur videos that you thought would be totally gone from the Internet reside on Smutr, and I am absolutely amazed that the webmaster is still keeping it alive, and without shitty ads as well. Either way, I fucking love it... and I hope it stays online forever. Where would I go for my daily (oops!) dose of Kickaz and DelightfulHug videos? Certainly not on those normie or malware-infested websites. Thank you, Smutr! I loves you <3</p>

                    <p>I'm definitely no Jihadi John or anything like that; I quite frankly don't even care about religion all that much... if anything, I would be into racial humiliation (LMAO) if it were one of my kinks. But, during one of those long boring days when I was supposed to be working, and doing those annoying pesky invoices, I typed into my trusty FireFox: "PornMeka.com" and low and behold: IT actually fucking worked! My FireFox browser rendered a fucking porn site. Even though I didn't think it would work, and that there would be some crazy-ass fucker out there who would name their site "PornMeka", they actually fucking did it... and stayed alive! Thank Jesus that those fuckers from ISIS didn't get him and that he's sound and safe, probably somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia, doing the Lord's work and giving us some goddamn honest-to-God straight and normal porn that you would recommend to quite about any decent fella out there. I say that PornMeka.com, in spite of its weird name is probably the best site out there to fap to normal shit and to have a nice giggle at its name while you're at it. It helped me many a times, and I hope that they keep on doing their shit! Rock on! #MAGA!</p>
