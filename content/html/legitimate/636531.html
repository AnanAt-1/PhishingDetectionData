The Nevada-California-Oregon had its roots in Western Nevada in the late 1870s.  In December 1879 a group of 
investors headed by one John T. Davis formed the Western Nevada Railroad Company to build south from 
Wadsworth, NV to the Walker Lake region.  As additional investors became involved the base of operations 
shifted to Reno, and the projected railroad stretched from Bodie, CA, north through Reno to the Columbia 
River.  The company re-incorporated into The Nevada &amp; Oregon Railroad, later changed to Nevada &amp; 
Oregon Railroad.  The early history of this company is filled with corporate intrigue and shenanigans, 
including one Board of Directors meeting that ended in a gunfight between opposing factions and a period 
of time when two separate Boards claimed direction of the company.<br>
<br>
The first shovels broke ground on the new venture in Reno on 22 December 1880.  The corporate situations 
outlined above coupled with a general lack of money kept actual construction at a slow pace.  The company 
decided early on to start the line north from Reno first.  Grading progressed slowly to the north, and 
the first rails were spiked down on 28 May 1881.  Narrow gauge fever was sweeping the country at the time, 
and the allure of cheaper initial construction costs was enough to convince the N&amp;O to build its tracks 
with three feet between the rails as compared to the 4 feet, eight and a half inches between the rails found 
on standard gauge tracks.  By 8 September 1881 construction crews had finished twenty one miles of grade and 
ten miles of track.  The completed railroad stretched to Oneida, thirty miles north of Reno, by September 
1882.  The company commenced regular service over the completed track on 2 October of that year.<br>
<br>
The Moran Brothers, a New York banking firm, had been one of the early and most prominent investors in the 
Nevada &amp; Oregon.  On 17 April 1884 the Morans took full control of the railroad when they purchased the 
company at a court ordered auction.  They were the only bidders at the sale, and thus their bid of $372,534.21 
carried the day.  The original N&amp;O stockholders had six months in which to redeem the property, but they 
had no money to work with.  With the Morans the railroad finally found relatively firm financial footing and 
constant leadership, and northward construction once again picked up.  The railroad also got a new name, the 
Nevada &amp; California Railroad, in January 1885.<br>

Northward construction resumed in October 1885.  The rails reached Junction, at the foot of Beckwourth Pass, 
by the end of 1884.  Construction resumed in 1887, with the next effort carrying the railroad up along the 
eastern shores of Honey Lake.  Susanville had long wished for a railroad, and the citizens of the town 
became so disgusted with the narrow gauge's choice of route bypassing the town that many merchants chose 
to team supplies to and from Chico instead of patronizing the more local railroad.  The end of 1888 found the 
railroad at a point known as Liegan, 70 miles north of Reno.  The next extension took the railroad to the 
newly established town of Amedee, where construction stopped.  The company spent the next several years 
improving the lines already constructed and trying to build business up.  Various financial panics in the 
east also made additional construction capital impossible to find.  On 1 January 1893 the name of the 
railroad changed again, this time to the Nevada-California-Oregon, a name that would stick with the company 
through the rest of its existence.  The initials- NCO- prompted at least two nicknames for the railroad, the 
"Narrow, Crooked &amp; Ornery" and the "Northern California Outrage".<br>

The next northward extension commenced in 1899, and by June 1900 fifty additional miles of track had been 
spiked down.  The next year saw 14 more miles completed, extending the railroad to the small town of Madeline. 
Construction halted until June 1906 when the next phase started, with service extended to Likely by October 
1907 and Alturas by December 1908.  Construction pushed north from Alturas, with Lakeview, OR reached on 
10 January 1912.  It took the company 32 years to build the 238 miles of railroad from Reno to Lakeview; the 
company charter indicated plans to continue north through Prineville to The Dalles on the Columbia River, with 
one branch running through Klamath Falls to the Rogue River Valley and another running to the Eugene area in 
the Willamette Valley, but no further construction ever took place.  It is interesting to note that during 
the same time period that the N-C-O built north from Alturas the Sumpter Valley Railroad, also narrow 
gauge, pushed a line of their railroad west as far as Prairie City, OR, with the stated intentions of 
connecting with the N-C-O somewhere around Prineville.  If this had come to pass it would have been possible
for one to ride in narrow guage cars nearly all the way from Baker City, OR, to the south end of the Owens Valley 
in Southern California, with the only standard gauge portion of the trip occuring on the rails of the Virginia 
&amp; Truckee Railroad from Reno to Mound House, NV.<br>

The N-C-O survived as an intact railroad for only six years.  In 1917 the railroad sold the 64 miles south 
of Hackstaff to the Western Pacific Railroad for $700,000.  WP abandoned a portion of the N-C-O that paralleled 
its mainline and converted the rest to standard gauge to become its Reno branch.  N-C-O left Reno for good 
on 30 January 1918.  Reno had been the location of the company's headquarters and shops since the beginning, 
and the company relocated these facilities to Alturas.  The next cutback came in October 1922 when the 16 
miles between Hackstaff and Wendel came out.  By this point the railroad was in a critical financial 
situation, and the Morans were looking for a way out.<br>

Relief for the Morans came in 1925 in the form of a <a href="sp.html"target="blank">
<u>Southern Pacific</u></a> offer to purchase the company.  The two companies signed 
 an agreement on 30 April 1925, and SP took control in October 1926.  SP converted the railroad to standard 
 gauge between 1927 and 1928.  SP sent much of the N-C-O equipment they inherited south to their 
 narrow gauge system in California's Owens Valley.  SP maintained the original N-C-O name on standard 
 gauge equipment assigned to line until 1 September 1929, when the line became part and parcel of SP's system.<br>
 <br>
 Thus ended the life and times of one of the most interesting and colorful narrow gauge railroads in the west.  
 Had the N-C-O achieved its initial plans the railroading history of Oregon's high desert region may have been 
 written very differently.<br>
