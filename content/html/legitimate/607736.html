      One of the six major North American railways, known as Class 1 railways,
      Canadian National Railway Company (CN) operates the largest rail network
      in Canada and the only transcontinental network in North America. In
      Canada, the CN network encompasses 12,900 route miles in eight Canadian
      provinces, including the nation&#x0027;s five major ports&#x2014;Vancouver
      and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, on the Pacific; the key Great Lakes
      port of Thunder Bay, Ontario; and Montreal and Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
      the Atlantic. The U.S. network comprises 6,400 route miles in 16 states,
      connecting the Canadian network to the U.S. Midwest (including Chicago)
      down to the Gulf of Mexico and the ports of Mobile, Alabama, and New
      Orleans. The company is also able to offer its customers access to Mexico
      and the U.S. Southwest through a marketing alliance with the Kansas City
      Southern Railway Company, with the two networks interconnecting in
      Jackson, Mississippi. The diversified freight transported over CN rails
      are well balanced among petroleum and chemicals, grain and fertilizers,
      coal, metals and minerals, forest products, automotive products, and
      intermodal services (the movement of trailers and containers on railroad
      freight cars). CN also holds interests in two overseas railways: 42.5
      percent of English, Welsh &#x0026; Scottish Railway Holdings Limited of
      Great Britain and 33 percent of Australian Transport Network Limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      CN was formed in the post-World War I era through the integration and
      nationalization of two of the country&#x0027;s largest railroads, Canadian
      Northern and Grand Trunk. Although they were not the first railroads to
      come under government control, these two systems formed the basis of
      Canada&#x0027;s largest transportation conglomerate. After 78 years as a
      Crown corporation, CN was privatized through an initial public offering
      (IPO) on November 28, 1995. This was the largest privatization in Canadian
      history, raising CAD 2.26 billion for the government of Canada. Key
      post-privatization events included the 1999 acquisition of Illinois
      Central Corporation, the scuttling by regulators of a proposed merger with
      Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation in 2000, and the acquisitions of
      Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation (2001), the rail and marine
      holdings of Great Lakes Transportation LLC (2004), and BC Rail Ltd.
      (2004).

      <i>
        The Grand Trunk and
        <br />
         Canadian Northern Predecessors
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      CN was created as a result of the near-collapse of the Canadian Northern
      and Grand Trunk railways not long after the end of World War I. When a
      postwar economic depression undermined the railroads&#x0027; finances, the
      consolidation provided a way for the companies to avoid defaults on CAD
      1.3 billion in loans. It also gave Canada the second largest railway
      system in the world, with almost 100,000 employees and over 22,000 miles
      of track, nearly twice as much as its nearest competitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canada&#x0027;s railroads had enjoyed the support of government since the
      colonial era, when the Grand Trunk (GT) emerged as the dominion&#x0027;s
      first major railway. Incorporated in 1852, GT soon dominated the railway
      boom concentrated in central Canada between Montreal and Toronto. Close
      government cooperation came in the form of land grants, loans, and loan
      guarantees. The railway&#x0027;s first president, John Ross, also held a
      high government position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Railroad and government officials, however, envisioned disparate goals for
      GT&#x2014;profits for its British shareholders on the one hand and
      settlement of the vast western territories on the other. The public and
      private interests in the railway clashed before the end of the decade. In
      1858 British Columbia became a Crown colony and western settlement became
      government policy. A transcontinental railway would bind the colonies
      together and prevent American squatters from seizing the territory before
      Canadians had a chance, and as the Dominion&#x0027;s largest railway, the
      GT would naturally have been the vehicle of choice for this western
      movement. Expensive construction projects, however, had drained finances
      to the point that the company could not make interest payments on its
      loans, and shareholders&#x2014;who had yet to receive the dividends
      promised at the company&#x0027;s inception&#x2014;would not agree to what
      they saw as a losing venture. Under pressure from both the government and
      the company&#x0027;s investors, Ross and most of his board of directors
      resigned in 1858. GT&#x0027;s English shareholders sent Edward Watkin, a
      British railway executive who represented England&#x0027;s preeminence in
      the industry, as Ross&#x0027;s replacement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watkin and his managing director, Charles J. Brydges, continued the
      traditional mix of public and private support for the GT, but concentrated
      on financial reorganization and capital improvements. By 1865 they had
      built up traffic by 50 percent, increased net earnings, and made plans to
      replace iron rails with steel, upgrade from wood fuel to coal, and
      standardize rail gauges.
    </p>
    <p>
      As did his predecessor, Watkin had a vision of a coast-to-coast railway
      that would promote western settlement and bring about confederation. Two
      factors stood in the way: shareholders who wanted customers to be settled
      in the West before they would build a railway to serve them, and the
      Hudson&#x0027;s Bay Company, owner of the territory between the eastern
      and western colonies. In 1863 Watkin engineered the takeover of the
      Hudson&#x0027;s Bay Company by a London-based finance company, bringing
      the possibility of a coast-to-coast railway even closer. In 1869, however,
      Watkin was ousted by those shareholders, led by Captain Henry W. Tyler,
      who opposed investment in the intercolonial railway. The Canadian
      government bought out the Hudson&#x0027;s Bay Company, and Grand Trunk
      began an era of eastern consolidation under Tyler.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 1880s, Tyler oversaw the absorption of 16 railways and expanded
      freight service to the United States. His concentration on American
      markets was rewarded&#x2014;25 percent of the railway&#x0027;s earnings
      came from meat and grain traffic between Chicago and New England. In 1882
      GT took over its largest competitor, the Great Western, and in 1888 it
      assumed control of Ontario&#x0027;s Northern Railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all this consolidation, Prime Minister John A. MacDonald,
      gave up his attempts to persuade Tyler and the GT to build to the western
      coast. Instead he contracted with a new system, the Canadian Pacific
      Railway, to build a transcontinental railway from the West. This would
      turn out to be a momentous decision&#x2014;privately held Canadian Pacific
      Railway remained CN&#x0027;s largest rail competitor into the early 21st
      century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tyler&#x0027;s 18-year reign at Grand Trunk was brought to an end by
      economic recession and, as with his predecessors, 20,000 fickle
      stockholders who blamed him for the loss of government support that,
      instead, sustained the Canadian Pacific during the &#x0022;lean
      years.&#x0022; Tyler&#x0027;s successor, Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, hired
      Charles Melville Hays&#x2014;an American with railroad
      experience&#x2014;to manage the nearly 5,000 miles of Grand Trunk track.
      Hays brought American management techniques to the still British-owned GT,
      made such physical improvements as better brakes and improved grades, and
      rebuilt the suspension bridge over the Niagara River into the United
      States. All these changes improved service and, by the end of the century,
      operating expenses had been reduced by 10 percent. Hays also satisfied
      English shareholders by enabling the company to finally pay out dividends
      on its shares. He quickly realized, though, that without service to the
      west, the Grand Trunk was just a &#x0022;feeder line&#x0022; for the
      western markets served by Canadian Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formidable competition also came from the Canadian Northern railroad,
      owned by William Mackenzie and Donald Mann, partners in Mackenzie Mann
      &#x0026; Co. Limited. The men, who met when both were working for Canadian
      Pacific, acquired their first railway in 1896, after they had decided to
      branch out on their own. Concentrating on the prairies to the north,
      Mackenzie and Mann built up the Canadian Northern by consolidating many
      small &#x0022;farmer&#x0027;s railroads&#x0022; into a system that offered
      transportation to 130 communities, with the motto &#x0022;Energy,
      Enterprise, Ability.&#x0022; They built connecting lines with the help of
      provincial grants and controlled 1,200 miles of track, serving
      Canada&#x0027;s breadbasket by 1902.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1896 all of Canada was booming; Prime Minister Sir Wilfred Laurier
      heralded the arrival of &#x0022;Canada&#x0027;s century.&#x0022; That year
      Grand Trunk&#x0027;s Charles M. Hays was finally able to announce the
      railroad&#x0027;s plan to open a line to the Pacific at the port of Prince
      Rupert. Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP), created as a subsidiary, was
      Hays&#x0027;s strategy for breaking out of the corner into which the
      railroad had been backed and ensuring Grand Trunk&#x0027;s future. He had
      tried to buy out the Canadian Northern, but Mackenzie and Mann hoped to
      build their own transcontinental railroad. In 1902, however, it was
      Mackenzie&#x0027;s turn to suggest that the two exchange traffic instead
      of building duplicate track, but by then Grand Trunk was too deep into
      GTP. The competition between Grand Trunk and Canadian Northern would prove
      to be the ruin of both systems.

      The Grand Trunk Pacific line was completed in 1914, but it was an empty
      victory. The Panama Canal opened that same year, drawing a steady stream
      of traffic from Vancouver and making that city into a major port, while
      Prince Rupert languished. 
       In addition, British ships no longer enjoyed the strong presence in the
      North Atlantic that they once did, further reducing traffic for Prince
      Rupert and GTP. The event that might have helped to keep Grand Trunk in
      private hands had it been undertaken 20 years earlier was now contributing
      to its failure. Meanwhile, Canadian Northern completed its
      transcontinental line from Vancouver to Montreal in 1915.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <i>
        Post-World War I Formation of Canadian National
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      By 1916 both Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk were on the brink of
      receivership. Overextension had stressed finances: Canada had at least
      twice as many railway miles per capita as the United States, much of it
      duplicating service. A royal commission recommended nationalization of the
      two, including Grand Trunk&#x0027;s subsidiary, GTP. It took four years to
      bring the former competitors together&#x2014;in addition to the National
      Transcontinental and the Intercolonial, two government lines&#x2014;to
      form one of the country&#x0027;s first Crown corporations, the Canadian
      National Railway Company Limited, created on June 6, 1919.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amalgamation brought together over 90 different railways to form a
      system divided into four geographical regions: the Atlantic, with
      headquarters in Moncton; the Central, headquartered in Toronto; the Grand
      Trunk Western, a U.S. system with headquarters in Detroit, Michigan; and
      the Western region, headquartered in Winnipeg. Each region had its own
      general manager and superintendents. CN&#x0027;s officers were all drawn
      from the various systems, which helped to unify the previously rival
      railways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reorganization was directed by David B. Hanna, former vice-president
      of the Canadian Northern. Despite the CAD 1.3 billion debt assumed by the
      newly formed system, Hanna began a program to rehabilitate the
      railroad&#x0027;s physical property and bring it up to par with that of
      the Canadian Pacific. His task was made more difficult by a postwar
      industrial recession, a flu epidemic, and history-making bad weather, but
      the program was supported by Prime Minister Mackenzie King&#x0027;s
      Liberal government and the healthy economy of the 1920s. Hanna also began
      to focus on new markets for CN, especially Asia and Europe. The Canadian
      Government Merchant Marine, a shipping arm of the CN created in 1919,
      helped open Asian markets and increased the level of competition with
      Canadian Pacific, which was already well established in the Pacific basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1923 Grand Trunk had been officially assimilated into the Canadian
      National system and Sir Henry Thornton became president. Now fully formed,
      CN stood as one of the world&#x0027;s largest railroads with more than
      22,000 miles of track and more than 100,000 employees. CN also operated
      express services, a telegraph company, a chain of hotels, and a steamship
      line. On the railroad side, Thornton continued to improve lines,
      equipment, and service and also reduce expenses. To entertain train
      travelers he established the first radio network in both Canada and North
      America in 1923. Ten years later the network was sold to the federal
      government, and it would evolve into the Canadian Broadcasting
      Corporation.
    </p>
    <p>
      CN began to compete with Canadian Pacific for the Asia-to-New York silk
      trade in 1925. Competition between the two was fierce&#x2014;every hour
      saved between the two coasts meant higher profits, because insurance on
      raw silk, a perishable commodity, ran as high as 6 percent per hour. The
      CN&#x0027;s &#x0022;silkers,&#x0022; trains carrying the precious cargo,
      traveled at speeds up to 90 miles per hour and took precedence over all
      other trains, including express passenger lines. They averaged just four
      days to cross the continent. The largest CN silker ran in October 1927.
      The 21-car train carried 7,200 bales of silk worth CAD 7 million. The
      success of CN&#x0027;s Asian freight service was encouraging, but the
      worldwide depression that began in 1929 brought an end to that optimism.

        1930s Through 1950s:
        <br />
         Financial Travails, Wartime, and Labor Strife
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Caught in the midst of trying to increase both the quality and quantity of
      services, the railway was shocked by the severity of the unexpected
      depression. In 1930 the support of the Liberal government was lost and by
      1932 Thornton was forced to resign and business had been curtailed. By
      that time the system&#x0027;s earnings had fallen 40 percent below those
      in its peak year of 1928, and CN was carrying only half the traffic it had
      two years earlier. A smaller-than-normal grain crop and a drop in the
      Japanese silk trade worsened the effects of the Great Depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1932 was the low point of the depression for Canadian National,
      with operating revenues decreasing a further 20 percent from those of the
      previous year. The depression was not the only force moving against the
      CN: new modes of transportation were quickly being developed to compete
      with the outdated railway system. Passengers preferred the convenience of
      buses, cars, and airplanes; shippers preferred the lower-cost, specialized
      services of the trucking industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trade picked up after 1932, when the British Empire employed such
      protectionist measures as quotas and increased customs duties on
      non-empire trade. Although business was generally improving by 1936, the
      depression and decreased Asian trade brought about the demise of the
      Canadian Government Merchant Marine. A brief trade war with Japan was
      settled in 1935, and CN enjoyed good trade relations with that country
      until 1941, when the United States, Britain, and Canada froze all Japanese
      assets during World War II.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, in another quirky aspect of CN&#x0027;s history, the
      Canadian government in 1937 established Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA) as a
      national airline and made it a subsidiary of Canadian National Railway.
      TCA, renamed Air Canada in 1964, remained a CN subsidiary until 1977 when
      it became a direct subsidiary of the federal government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years of World War II provided a boom in transportation that enabled
      Canadian National to make interest payments on all of its publicly held
      debt and to make its first profits. At the close of the 1940s, however,
      the company&#x0027;s debts began rising, freight volumes were falling, and
      passenger service appeared doomed. Donald Gordon, a banker and chairman of
      the World War II War Prices and Trade Board, was selected as president of
      CN. Gordon invested in the conversion from steam to diesel and
      modernization of the aging railway&#x0027;s physical
      properties&#x2014;three-fourths of the system&#x0027;s locomotives were
      over 30 years old. In 1952 the Canadian government gave Gordon the debt
      relief he needed. Recapitalization cut the system&#x0027;s interest
      charges by more than CAD 22 million per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the financial difficulties facing CN, there were growing
      problems on the labor front. Technological advances made within the rail
      industry cut staffing requirements: automation of train control and
      clerical operations decreased the need for office staff, while diesel
      locomotives and higher capacity freightcars allowed carriers to operate
      longer and heavier trains and lengthened the distance between service
      stops, affecting train and repair personnel. While rail management worked
      to maximize productivity gains, rail labor unions fought to save their
      members&#x0027; jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tensions between management and labor came to a head several times during
      the 1950s. A strike by 120,000 Canadian railway workers in August 1950
      brought rail transport to a halt, shutting down traffic from coast to
      coast. A government injunction sent the strikers back to work within two
      days. Other strikes were threatened during the 1950s, but arbitration kept
      the trains running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon accomplished many goals during the 1950s and 1960s. These
      achievements included decentralized management, replacing old rolling
      stock with new specialized containers, adding road transport to
      CN&#x0027;s roster of services, introducing computerized processes, and
      improving employee training. In spite of these measures, the railroad was
      still commonly viewed as a tool for national development, rather than a
      profit-making venture. As technology continued to diminish the role of
      railways, Canadian government and CN officials allowed the system to
      become mired in deficits. Changing regulations, irregular funding, and
      other political machinations were often caused by party changes. These
      issues limited CN&#x0027;s ability to grow and diversify in an age when
      the company could not afford to be confined to rail transport.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <i>
        Deregulation and Increasing Autonomy: 1960s&#x2013;80s
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the late 1960s deregulation and revision of government support put CN
      on the road to stability and increased profits. The National
      Transportation Act of 1967 removed nearly all the constraints on rates
      that had bound both the CN and Canadian Pacific. The legislation also
      compensated railways for unprofitable passenger services and branch lines
      that had been deemed necessary for the public welfare. CN was able to end
      its unprofitable passenger service in Newfoundland in 1969 as a result of
      the new law.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 1970s, CN&#x0027;s management concentrated on increasing
      autonomy and profitability. The organization of profit centers improved
      managerial accountability and highlighted areas of government-enforced
      losses. CN also concentrated on diversification, spreading the
      company&#x0027;s interests into telecommunications, hotels, and oil
      exploration. This measure took pressure off the company&#x0027;s slowing
      railway business.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1976 the Canadian government formed Via Rail Canada Inc. as a
      nationwide passenger rail service. Via Rail gradually began taking over
      responsibility for passenger train operation from both CN and archrival
      Canadian Pacific, a process largely complete by 1979. This relieved both
      railroad companies of the burden of running unprofitable passenger
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the railway&#x0027;s success in the 1980s was credited to
      increased independence from government constraints. The 1983 Western Grain
      Transportation Act brought an end to the 84-year-old Crow&#x0027;s Nest
      Pass Act, which had fixed shipping rates at 1925 levels. Only 20 percent
      of the actual transportation expenses had been covered, costing
      Canada&#x0027;s railways CAD 300 million per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legislative changes freed capital for investment in such technical
      improvements as double tracks that prevented bottlenecks, speeded rail
      traffic, and improved the system&#x0027;s ability to compete with U.S.
      railroads. The late 1980s also saw CN enter the stack-car market. Having a
      stack of two freight containers required hefty investments in new lift
      equipment and higher tunnel clearances, but the added capacity increased
      efficiency and helped CN compete for lucrative contracts to transport
      Asian auto parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1987, 46-year CN veteran Ronald Lawless was appointed president and CEO
      of the transport company. Over the course of his five-year tenure, the
      executive oversaw a series of massive cutbacks, slashing employment from
      100,000 to 40,000; eliminating over 40 percent of the railway&#x0027;s CAD
      3.4 billion debt, and divesting (per a 1988 government order) the
      corporation&#x0027;s hotel, telecommunications, and trucking operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two major strikes in the late 1980s marred a decade-long record of good
      labor relations. The Associated Railway Union&#x0027;s 
       50,000 members walked out over wages, pensions, and job security in
      August 1987. By the sixth day of the strike, government legislation that
      levied fines against workers who stayed off the job ended the stoppage.
      The legislation came in handy less than a week later, when 2,500 members
      of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers threatened to strike. In an
      effort to head off labor disputes, CN established a forum for labor and
      management in 1991.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early 1990s proved to be less financially stable for Canadian National
      than the previous decade. A recession reduced traffic that had already
      been siphoned off by competitors in the trucking and U.S. rail industries.
      Lingering regulatory constraints and high taxes further hampered the
      company&#x0027;s fiscal performance. To improve profitability, Canadian
      National&#x0027;s gas and oil subsidiary, CN Exploration, was privatized
      in 1991 and the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the federal
      deficit. Early in 1992 the railway combined its U.S. subsidiary, the Grand
      Trunk Corp., with its Canadian rail interests, thereby creating CN North
      America. The reorganization was part of an effort to exploit continental
      markets, provide more efficient, cost-effective service to CN&#x0027;s
      shippers, and increase cross-border business, which stood at about 25
      percent of annual sales.

        1992&#x2013;95: Cost Cutting and
        <br />
         Privatization Under Tellier
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      But in spite of Lawless&#x0027;s various cutbacks and reorganizations, an
      internal study completed in 1990 showed that CN was still one of North
      America&#x0027;s least competitive railways. Revenues declined 22 percent
      from 1988 to 1992, when the company suffered a CAD 893.7 million loss.
      When Lawless was called away to wield his budget axe at Via Rail in 1992,
      CN hired Paul M. Tellier as president and CEO. It did not take the new
      executive long to assess the situation. In 1993, he warned that the
      company&#x0027;s annual losses would continue to surge, reaching CAD 1.5
      billion by 1998, unless drastic measures were taken. Although some
      questioned this career civil servant&#x0027;s knowledge of the rail
      industry, Tellier was able&#x2014;by 1994&#x2014;to effect CN&#x0027;s
      first profit since 1990. It was not an easy task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tellier first cut employment at all levels. To show fiscal leadership and
      decentralize management, he slashed administrative layers by half in some
      cases. By 1993, he had reduced overall payroll to 32,700 employees.
      Although these layoffs cost CN CAD 80 million in 1993 alone (the company
      was obliged to buy out unionized workers&#x0027; employment security
      contracts at an average of CAD 80,000 each) they promised increased
      productivity in the years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tellier even initiated merger negotiations with longtime rival CP Rail in
      1992. When those talks broke down, the two firms tried to work out a deal
      to combine their beleaguered eastern operations, which together had lost
      over CAD 2 billion in recent years. More than one industry analyst had
      noted that overcapacity, especially east of Winnipeg, was a serious and
      ongoing threat to both players&#x0027; profitability. A 1993 review by the
      National Transportation Act Review Commission asserted that
      &#x0022;oversized rail networks&#x0022; had plagued the industry in
      general since the 1920s; at CN in particular, 90 percent of its tonnage
      traversed only one-third of its total trackage. Nonetheless, late in 1994,
      Transport Minister Douglas Young put the brakes on CP Rail&#x0027;s CAD
      1.4 billion offer to purchase CN&#x0027;s eastern assets, noting that the
      purchase price undervalued the property by at least 50 percent and
      threatened to reduce competition as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      After years of denying that CN was being groomed for a launch on the
      public markets, legislation to that very effect was introduced in May
      1995. The bill proposing Canadian National&#x0027;s privatization
      restricted individual share ownership to 15 percent and called for the
      creation of an employee stock option plan. In light of Quebec&#x0027;s
      flirtations with succession, the legislation also required the company to
      maintain its headquarters in Montreal and remain bilingual. Unlike
      previous IPOs of nationalized businesses, this one did not restrict share
      ownership to Canadians. The sheer size of the offering, at least CAD 1.6
      billion, was expected to overwhelm the Canadian stock market. The federal
      government anticipated an estimated CAD 1 billion return on the sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before being ready to go to market, however, CN still required some
      &#x0022;primping.&#x0022; As part of an effort to cut debt by 50 percent,
      and therefore make its massive stock flotation attractive to domestic and
      international investors, the firm sold to the government its real estate
      holdings, which included the CN Tower in Toronto and 85,000 acres of
      property, for about CAD 500 million. Thus, prior to the offering, the
      company&#x0027;s only significant nonrail holding was wholly owned
      subsidiary Canac, which was involved in worldwide consulting on
      transportation and in project management.
    </p>
    <p>
      These final moves enabled CN to proceed with the offering, which was
      completed on November 28, 1995. All of the company&#x0027;s shares were
      sold to investors via the Toronto, Montreal, and New York stock exchanges.
      Through an employee stock ownership plan, 42 percent of the shares went to
      CN employees. The offering raised CAD 2.26 billion ($1.65 billion) for
      government coffers, representing the largest privatization in Canadian
      history.

        Post-Privatization Efficiency Drive and
        <br />
         Acquisition of Illinois Central
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although CN suffered a CAD 1.08 billion loss in 1995 stemming from special
      charges of CAD 1.45 billion&#x2014;primarily representing a writedown of
      the value of assets, most notably in the troubled eastern Canadian part of
      its network&#x2014;1996, the firm&#x0027;s first full year as an
      investor-owned company, was its most profitable year in history. CN was
      able to post an operating profit of CAD 610 million and a net profit of
      CAD 142 million on revenue of CAD 4.16 billion, despite a special charge
      of CAD 381 million taken in the fourth quarter. The charge was taken in
      connection with plans to lay off an additional 2,250 workers in 1996 and
      1997. A reduction in labor costs of CAD 95 million helped CN lower its
      operating ratio to 85.3 percent in 1996, compared to the 89.3 percent
      figure for the preceding year. Tellier had placed an emphasis on lowering
      CN&#x0027;s operating ratio, a key yardstick of a railway&#x0027;s
      efficiency, and profitability, that compared expenses with revenues (the
      lower the figure the better).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another aspect of Tellier&#x0027;s efficiency drive was to eliminate
      unprofitable track and reduce the amount of overcapacity in the railway
      system. Thousands of miles of track were sold or 
       abandoned in the mid- to late 1990s. He also invested heavily in
      information technology to allow CN to cut turnaround times, improve
      service, and operate with thousands fewer railcars. By 1997 Tellier had
      cut the operating ratio to 78.6 percent, which while much improved was
      still higher than those of the top U.S. railroads. In October 1998 CN
      announced plans to cut an additional 3,000 jobs, earning Tellier the
      enmity of many workers and union leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tellier also staked the future of Canadian National on the growth in
      north-south traffic of industrial products, automobiles, and commodities
      such as forest products engendered by the North American Free Trade
      Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in 1994. He told 
      <i>
        Barron&#x0027;s
      </i>
       in 1999, &#x0022;We want to be the NAFTA railroad.&#x0022; To that end,
      he engineered the $2.4 billion acquisition of Illinois Central Corporation
      (IC), completed in July 1999. The Illinois Central had been chartered in
      1851 as the first land grant railroad in the United States. By 1999 it had
      grown into a 3,450-mile railroad, and the most efficient one in North
      America, its operating ratio in 1997 standing at 62.3 percent. Its
      trackage extended south from Chicago to New Orleans. This made a perfect
      fit with CN&#x0027;s system, which traversed Canada from Vancouver to
      Halifax and reached into the United States as far as Chicago. Combined,
      the two systems totaled 18,700 miles&#x2014;the fifth largest in North
      America&#x2014;and comprised the only railway on the continent connecting
      the three coasts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and the Gulf of Mexico. The
      resulting Y-shaped system had little overlap, which eased the concerns of
      regulators troubled by other recent rail combinations that had disrupted
      rail service and upset customers. It also meant that no significant
      layoffs were necessary from the combined workforce of 24,600.
    </p>
    <p>
      In April 1998, after the merger had been announced but well before its
      completion, CN and IC entered into a deal that extended the reach of the
      combined system to the U.S. Southwest and into Mexico. The two companies
      reached a marketing alliance with the Kansas City Southern Railway Company
      (KCSR) through which CN could offer its customers coordinated interline
      train service throughout the three networks. The KCSR system ranged from
      Springfield, Illinois, where it could interchange with CN/IC, through
      Kansas City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and then into the south, where another
      major interchange was established in Jackson, Mississippi. KCSR track also
      ranged west into Texas, including both Dallas and Houston, and the
      alliance also offered shippers access to Mexico&#x0027;s largest rail
      system, Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo TFM),
      which was in a separate alliance with KCSR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the acquisition of IC, Tellier remained president and CEO of CN,
      but he ceded control of day-to-day operations of the railroad to the
      former head of Illinois Central, E. Hunter Harrison, who was named
      executive vice-president and chief operating officer. Unlike Tellier,
      Harrison was a veteran railroad man, having entered the industry in 1964
      as a carman/oiler. He was given much of the credit for making IC such an
      efficiently run railroad, particularly by implementing &#x0022;scheduled
      railroading,&#x0022; whereby freight trains were operated on a more
      precise schedule than had been typical. Under Harrison, CN too would
      become a scheduled railway, enabling it to considerably increase its usage
      of locomotives, freight cars, and train crews.

        <br />
         Several More Acquisitions
      </i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The impact of the IC deal was immediately felt as CN posted record profits
      of CAD 751 million in 1999, up from CAD 266 million the previous year. The
      operating ratio was down to 70.7 percent by the end of that year. It was
      from this position of strength that Canadian National agreed to combine
      its rail systems with those of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation
      (BNSF) in a $6 billion deal that would have created a new holding company
      called North American Railways Inc. and the largest railroad on the
      continent with a network covering more than 50,000 route miles. In March
      2000, however, the U.S. regulatory authority over the rail industry, the
      Surface Transportation Board (STB), issued a 15-month moratorium on rail
      mergers. The STB was concerned that the CN-BNSF merger could cause
      irreparable harm to the industry, setting off a &#x0022;final
      round&#x0022; of rail consolidation, the eventual result of which could be
      just two transcontinental railways. After a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld
      the moratorium in July, CN and BNSF called off the merger rather than
      endure a lengthy delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointed that the deal was blocked but undeterred from his
      determination to see CN grow, Tellier completed the acquisition of
      Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation (WCTC) in October 2001 for
      about $800 million in cash plus the assumption of $400 million in debt. CN
      thereby added about 2,150 miles of track, the key addition being a stretch
      of track running between Chicago and the twin port cities of Duluth,
      Minnesota/Superior, Wisconsin, that enabled CN to secure a main link
      between western Canada and the U.S. Midwest. CN also inherited
      WCTC&#x0027;s interests in several overseas railroads, including 42.5
      percent of English, Welsh &#x0026; Scottish Railway Holdings Limited of
      Great Britain and 33 percent of Australian Transport Network Limited.
    </p>

      In the last major moves of his tenure at CN, Tellier announced in November
      2002 that the company would slash its workforce by 5 percent, or 1,146
      jobs, and take a $173 million charge to settle growing personal injury and
      asbestos claims in the United States. The reasons for the job cuts were
      twofold: a drought in western Canada that reduced CN&#x0027;s grain
      shipping revenue and the efficiency drive that cut the number of
      locomotives and railcars the company needed, leading in turn to a reduced
      need for workers. At the end of 2002, Tellier left CN to become president
      and CEO of Bombardier Inc., the Canadian maker of transportation
      equipment. Harrison was the choice to succeed Tellier at CN.

      The leadership transition was a smooth one as CN posted sharp increases in
      both profits and revenues in 2003 and 2004, culminating in the latter year
      in record net income of CAD 1.26 billion ($1.08 billion) on best-ever
      revenues of CAD 6.55 billion ($5.46 billion). The CAD 17.8 million lost as
      a result of a monthlong strike in early 2004 by 5,000 CN workers, all
      members of the Canadian Auto Workers union, was more than offset by the
      completion of two more significant acquisitions. In May 2004 CN acquired
      the rail and marine holdings of Great Lakes Transportation LLC (GLT) for
      CAD 547 million ($395 million). GLT was a group of rail and water carriers
      that catered particularly to the needs of the steel industry in the
      Midwest and that provided CN with additional links between western Canada 
       and Chicago. It included the 200-plus-mile Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range
      Railway Company, an iron ore carrier; the Bessemer &#x0026; Lake Erie
      Railroad Company, a transporter of coal, iron ore, and limestone between
      the port of Conneaut, Ohio, and steel mills in Pittsburgh; and Great Lakes
      Fleet Inc., a firm that owned and operated eight vessels carrying bulk
      commodities on the Great Lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July 2004 CN finalized its purchase of BC Rail Ltd. from the government
      of British Columbia for CAD 1 billion. The deal gave CN ownership of the
      BC Rail franchise and the right to operate over its more than 1,400 miles
      of track under a long-term lease. The province retained ownership of the
      track itself, but CN assumed responsibility for track maintenance. The BC
      Rail trackage ran from North Vancouver to Fort Nelson in the far northern
      reaches of the province. CN immediately announced plans to cut BC
      Rail&#x0027;s workforce to 950 employees, from 1,380, sparking a great
      deal of criticism. This acquisition strengthened CN&#x0027;s position in
      forest products shipping and also enhanced its access to the U.S. West
      Coast. Industry observers suggested that additional acquisitions were
      possible given CN&#x0027;s success in integrating the deals, its strong
      profits and cash flow, and its continued position as the most efficient
      railroad among the North American majors.
