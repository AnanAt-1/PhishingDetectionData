Jada: multiple object spaces for Java<sup>tm</sup>
</h3></center>

<b>Jada</b> is a package for Java that allows distributed Java applications (or
even applets) to acces a shared object
space for coordination and data sharing purposes (just like
Linda<sup>tm</sup> does).<br>
Using <b>Jada</b>, applications can access as many object spaces as they like; 
each object space can be either local or remote (local object spaces can be
shared between threads; remote tuple spaces can be shared between java
application or applets).<br>
Using <b>Jada</b> you can easily build distributed applications for the WWW,
just download the package and watch at the demos that come with it.
<hr>
The current version of <b>Jada</b> is 3.0 beta and its use is reserved for 
research projects and applications. Any user should register (I would really
appreciate if do so) sending me an e-mail message.
This version of <b>Jada</b> is not backward compatible with the previous ones 
(but just little changes are required), if you're using an old version of
<b>Jada</b>, please update your programs.<br>
Since this is a beta version I also encourage you to send me bug reports,
thanks.<br>

I'm writing the wrapper code
for a breakthrough demo application for <b>Jada</b>: a
distributed WWW based hearts card game. It should be available in the net
within the end of the year; in the
meanwhile you can give a look to

preview.
