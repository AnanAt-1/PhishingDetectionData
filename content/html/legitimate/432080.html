<p><b>Optimus Prime</b> is the awe-inspiring <a href="/wiki/Prime_(rank)" title="Prime (rank)">leader</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Autobot" title="Autobot">Autobot</a> forces. Selfless and endlessly courageous, he is the complete opposite of his mortal enemy <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a>. Originally a mere civilian known as <b>Orion Pax</b> or <b>Optronix</b>, he was chosen by the <a href="/wiki/Matrix_of_Leadership" title="Matrix of Leadership">Matrix of Leadership</a> to lead, the first in a number of heavy burdens he has been forced to bear. Another is his bringing of the <a href="/wiki/Transformer" title="Transformer">Transformers</a>' conflict to Earth. Every casualty, <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a> or Cybertronian weighs heavily on his <a href="/wiki/Spark" title="Spark">spark</a>. He does not show this side to his soldiers and never succumbs to despair. The Autobots need a decisive, charismatic leader and that is what he gives them. It was that leadership which turned the tide of the <a href="/wiki/Great_War_(G1)" title="Great War (G1)">Great War</a>.
</p><p>On the battlefield, there are few who rival Optimus Prime's prowess. He is easily the strongest of any Autobot his <a href="/wiki/Scale" title="Scale">size</a>. When teamed with his <a href="/wiki/Combat_Deck_(G1)" title="Combat Deck (G1)">Combat Deck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roller_(G1)" title="Roller (G1)">Roller</a> drone, his <a href="/wiki/Ion_blaster" title="Ion blaster">ion blaster</a> and <a href="/wiki/Energon-axe" title="Energon-axe">energon-axe</a> are deadly weapons. He would sacrifice his life to protect his fellow Autobots or those under their care and <a href="/wiki/The_many_deaths_of_Optimus_Prime" title="The many deaths of Optimus Prime">does so on a regular basis</a>. His compassion for other sentient beings is his only real weakness, and one the Decepticons have taken advantage of time and again... though it's also the source of his strength!

<p>During a Decepticon attack, Cliffjumper pleaded with Optimus to let him jump into the fray. Optimus denied his request, telling him that they already had the Decepticons on the run. In the battle's aftermath, the Decepticon's activity seem to vanish altogether. Grateful for the quiet, Optimus decided to head out and fetch extra fuel for the Autobots with Sparkplug. He returned just in time to find his Autobots in the middle of a battle with the Decepticons. With Sparkplug and Prowl's help, Optimus refuelled his troops, and once more drove the Decepticons back. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Decepticons" title="Revenge of the Decepticons">Revenge of the Decepticons</a></span>

Realizing his only hope for survival lay with Cybertron, Optimus then boarded the ship the Autobots were repairing, and travelled back to his home planet.

Optimus then met an old Autobot codger who pleaded that he return to Earth to gather a force that could overthrow the Decepticon's regime. Optimus remorsefully told the old Autobot that there could be no reinforcements from the planet Earth. The two Autobots were then swarmed by Decepticon police officers, who Optimus fought until his dying breath...
</p><p>Only for Optimus to awaken for real, back on Earth and surrounded by his troops. Realizing that his trip to Cybertron was a dream, Optimus instructed his Autobots to redouble their efforts in fixing up their ship, certain that they would soon need to return to Cybertron. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Return_to_Cybertron_(sticker_book)" title="Return to Cybertron (sticker book)">Return to Cybertron</a></span>

<p>When Optimus captained an Autobots spacecraft with the intent of clearing an asteroid field headed for Cybertron, he found his ship and crew attacked by the Decepticons. Rather than allow his Autobots to be taken prisoner, he deliberately crashed the Ark on Earth into a volcano.
</p><p>Millions of years later, Optimus was one of the thirty-five Autobots rebuilt into modern machines by the ship"s computer. Some time later, Jazz reported that he had spotted Decepticon activity at a nearby construction site. Optimus decided to take a proactive angle to their war with the Decepticons, and led the entirety of his troops to the Decepticon base. Once there, they found themselves allowed in by Megatron, feigning a friendly demeanor. Not fooled by Megatron's claims that he was making an honest living heading a construction company, Optimus engaged the evil robots in combat, before being blasted out of the Decepticon base. Optimus and his troops were sent tumbling down the cliffside beneath their feet. The Autobots suffered only minor damage from the fall, and after getting patched up, moved out once more to stop Megatron's plan, now well under way. Megatron was holding millions of humans hostage in a bid to get the Earth to surrender unconditionally to the Decepticons.
</p><p>The two sides found themselves equally matched until the Constructicons merged into The Devastator. The tables were turned once more when the Dinobots appeared, and mercilessly slaughtered the Constructicons. The Decepticons' plan foiled, Optimus decided that the Autobot-Decepticon war had come to an end, despite Megatron's protests to the contrary. He and his Autobots then drove away victorious. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Battle_for_Earth" title="Battle for Earth">Battle for Earth</a></span>

<p>Optimus pondered <a href="/wiki/Sunstreaker_(G1)" title="Sunstreaker (G1)">Sunstreaker</a>'s whereabouts after noticing that he had been absent from Autobot headquarters for longer than expected. The answer came through <a href="/wiki/Blaster_(G1)" title="Blaster (G1)">Blaster</a>, who relayed a message from <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a>; Sunstreaker was the Decepticons' captive. Megatron demanded that the Autobots surrender, or else Sunstreaker would be destroyed and rebuilt as a Decepticon! The Autobots refused to give up without a fight, but Optimus took care to explain the threat they were up against before a rescue party headed out. Optimus told <a href="/wiki/Sideswipe_(G1)" title="Sideswipe (G1)">Sideswipe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slag_(G1)" title="Slag (G1)">Slag</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sludge_(G1)" title="Sludge (G1)">Sludge</a> of <a href="/wiki/Devastator_(G1)" title="Devastator (G1)">Devastator</a>'s combiner nature, and warned them not take the danger he posed lightly. The rescue squad failed in liberating Sunstreaker, and were captured themselves. The Autobots were shaken by this turn of events, but Optimus was able to think up a new plan to trick the Decepticons. He ordered his Autobots to build a hollow statue of Devastator for him and his soldiers to hide within. Optimus then wrote a letter explaining that the statue was a peace offering for the Decepticons, and the completed decoy was placed before the Decepticons' base. The ruse worked, and Optimus and his troops burst forth from the false Devastator after the Decepticons had let down their guard. An all-out brawl between Autobots and Decepticons followed. The fight came to an end when Megatron attempted to down Optimus with his fusion cannon, only for Optimus to deflect Megatron's beam back at him by bouncing it off a reflective piece of metal. With the Decepticons defeated, Optimus ordered his troops to retrieve their wounded and return to Autobot headquarters. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Autobots%27_Secret_Weapon" title="The Autobots' Secret Weapon">The Autobots' Secret Weapon</a></span>

Optimus was tasked to hunt down and deactivate Sideswipe, though the task proved to be easy as Sideswipe did not run, hide or resist. After Optimus had deactivated Sideswipe, he was approached by Prowl, who pointed out that Sideswipe's actions made little sense, as he had committed the crime in broad daylight before many witnesses. Agreeing that the Decepticons might be behind the situation, Optimus allowed Prowl to take a team of Autobots to <a href="/wiki/Carob_Island" title="Carob Island">Carob Island</a> to clear Sideswipe's name while Optimus and Jazz stayed behind to continue working on human/Autobot relations. Prowl returned with evidence that it was indeed a Decepticon-controlled clone of Sideswipe that had committed the crime. Optimus then presumably reactivated Sideswipe when his name was cleared. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Deadly_Paradise" title="Deadly Paradise">Deadly Paradise</a></span>

Optimus Prime and <a href="/wiki/Leader-1_(GoBots)" title="Leader-1 (GoBots)">Leader-1</a> shook hands as a symbol of the transdimensional friendship, and the Autobots returned to their home reality, secure in the knowledge that they had allies in places as distant as alternate realities. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Source:Ask_Vector_Prime/Facebook#September_30.2C_2015" title="Source:Ask Vector Prime/Facebook">Ask Vector Prime, 30/09/2015</a></span>

Prowl and Red Alert followed with the Spy Changers team, although they didn't end up on the 22nd Strata as expected. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Source:Transformers:_Renegade_Rhetoric#May_2.2C_2016" title="Source:Transformers: Renegade Rhetoric">Renegade Rhetoric (2), 02/05/2016</a></span> The Decepticons made several raids against local human facilities, and the Autobots were unable to stop them or rescue Optimus Prime. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Source:Transformers:_Renegade_Rhetoric#May_5.2C_2016" title="Source:Transformers: Renegade Rhetoric">Renegade Rhetoric (2), 05/05/2016</a></span>
</p><p>Wheeljack eventually located the Decepticon Earth Base by tapping into their communications network. It was a trap, for the Decepticons had recreated Spy Changer technology for themselves, becoming second generation Go-Bots. What's more, their captured <a href="/wiki/Brainwave_Scanner" title="Brainwave Scanner">Brainwave Scanner</a> was used to reprogram Optimus, turning him into the Decepticon <a href="/wiki/Nemesis_Prime_(G1)" title="Nemesis Prime (G1)">Nemesis Prime</a>.

</p><p>Autobot morale crumbled as the Spy Changers split into two factions between the feuding Prowl and Red Alert. Megatron soon discovered the inevitable result of draining all compassion, remorse, and inhibition from Optimus Prime, though. Nemesis Prime made a play for Decepticon leadership and convinced Frenzy and <a href="/wiki/Crash_Test" title="Crash Test" class="mw-redirect">Crash Test</a> to support him against Megatron and his loyalists, Soundwave, Rumble and <a href="/wiki/Nightracer_(G1)" title="Nightracer (G1)">Nightracer</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Source:Transformers:_Renegade_Rhetoric#May_19.2C_2016" title="Source:Transformers: Renegade Rhetoric">Renegade Rhetoric (2), 19/05/2016</a></span>
</p><p>Nemesis Prime and the Decepticons attempted to hijack the D-5 supertrain out of Jasper, Nevada. Prowl's Autobots confronted them, but failed to elicit any signs of Optimus Prime' true personality as they battled. Prowl triggered the emergency "Red Mode" to destroy the D-5 once the Decepticons seized it. Furious, Nemesis Prime grabbed an <a href="/wiki/Kelly_(RID)" title="Kelly (RID)">innocent human</a> and threatened to kill her if the Autobots didn't comply. Prowl laid down his weapon and stated he knew Optimus would never go through with hurting her. Indeed, Nemesis struggled internally until his real mind broke free, and Optimus Prime returned to defeat Frenzy and Crash Test. Red Alert's team also dealt with Megatron's minions, and Optimus reunited Prowl and Red's squads under his command. They chased down the lone Megatron, only to witness him disappear through a Reality Bridge that self-destructed behind him. The entity known as <a href="/wiki/Waspinator_(BW)" title="Waspinator (BW)">Thrustinator</a> arrived, and the Autobots prepared to follow him on the trail of Megatron. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Source:Transformers:_Renegade_Rhetoric#July_14.2C_2016" title="Source:Transformers: Renegade Rhetoric">Renegade Rhetoric (2), 14/07/2016</a></span>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Dinobots_Strike_Back">Dinobots Strike Back</span></h4>
<p>In the first nexus, when <a href="/wiki/Swoop_(G1)" title="Swoop (G1)">Swoop</a> reported back to Autobot HQ that the other <a href="/wiki/Dinobot_(G1)" title="Dinobot (G1)">Dinobots</a> were being controlled by <a href="/wiki/Bombshell_(G1)" title="Bombshell (G1)">Bombshell's</a> <a href="/wiki/Cerebro-shell" title="Cerebro-shell">cerebro-shells</a>, Optimus had to decide whether to stop them with an immediate full-scale assault, or consult the Ark's computer. If he led an immediate attack, the cerebro-shells were jolted loose when his troops carried out his order to, "Bring them down fast and hard". If he consulted the computer, he then had to choose between its plan to have <a href="/wiki/Windcharger_(G1)" title="Windcharger (G1)">Windcharger</a> remove the shells from a distance with his magnetic powers, or go with <a href="/wiki/Mirage_(G1)" title="Mirage (G1)">Mirage's</a> idea to lure the Dinobots over <a href="/wiki/Bandit%27s_Bluff" title="Bandit's Bluff">Bandit's Bluff</a> with an Optimus Prime hologram. If he chose Mirage's plan, the Dinobots charged over the cliff and into the ocean, where they were salvaged for repairs back at base. If he let Windcharger lead operations at the bluff so he could confer with <a href="/wiki/Skids_(G1)" title="Skids (G1)">Skids</a> about some strange activity near <a href="/wiki/Dolphin%27s_Bay" title="Dolphin's Bay">Dolphin's Bay</a>, it was out of his hands whether Windcharger accidentally tore the Dinobots to bits, or harmlessly removed the cerebro-shells. The latter outcome led to <a href="/wiki/Grimlock_(G1)" title="Grimlock (G1)">Grimlock</a> telling Optimus that Bombshell said controlling them was just part of a larger plan, and the Autobot leader realized that it might tie in to Skids's report. Skids and <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)" title="Bumblebee (G1)">Bumblebee</a> could investigate in <a href="/wiki/Wheeljack_(G1)" title="Wheeljack (G1)">Wheeljack's</a> new mini-sub, but should he send <a href="/wiki/Sludge_(G1)" title="Sludge (G1)">Sludge</a> along with them?
</p><p>If he didn't send Sludge with them, the odds were 2 to 1 that the Autobots would all be destroyed as part of Operation Black Coral. The one possible positive outcome ended with Optimus fighting a duel against <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a> atop <a href="/wiki/Mount_Lomas" title="Mount Lomas">Mount Lomas</a> in which Prime (somehow) split into his three components to surround his archenemy.

<p>Suspicious at the lack of recent Decepticon activity, Optimus Prime sent Bumblebee out on a scouting mission. When Bumblebee did not return for some time, Optimus began to worry, and sent out Prowl, Hound and Swoop to check up on the little Autobot.
</p><p>In several versions of the events that unfolded next, Swoop would return to the Autobots' headquarters, and inform Optimus and his troops that the rest of his group was under Decepticon attack, and Optimus would subsequently lead his troops to rescue them.
</p><p>In an alternate version of the following events, Bumblebee would return to base, reporting that the Decepticons were planning to destroy the humans' farmlands in an attempt to starve mankind and force them into submission. Upon hearing these news, Optimus gathered a squad of Autobots and headed out to stop the evil robots. However, once they found themselves in the open country, they found themselves at the mercy of a Decepticon ambush; Bumblebee had been fed false information! In one iteration of the events that followed, Optimus could have avoided his death if only he had listened to <a href="/wiki/You" title="You">your</a> warning! In another iteration, Optimus had to decide whether he should send his Autobots away to the safety of a nearby bridge while he fended off the encroaching Decepticon horde, or if he should remain by the side of his troops as they all made a break for the bridge. Remaining as a single unit would spell their doom, but by sticking together, the Autobots could make it back to the safety of their base. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Battle_Drive" title="Battle Drive">Battle Drive</a></span>

<p>In the third nexus, Optimus oversaw <a href="/wiki/Ironhide_(G1)" title="Ironhide (G1)">Ironhide</a> testing <a href="/wiki/Sparkplug_Witwicky" title="Sparkplug Witwicky">Sparkplug</a>'s latest invention, the <a href="/wiki/Sun-Pak" title="Sun-Pak">Sun-Pak</a>, a miraculous device capable of fuelling a Transformer for an entire Earth day after being charged for only an hour in sunlight. As the trial-run wound down to an end, the Decepticons suddenly burst into the Autobots' secret underground testing facility, forcing Optimus to decide whether to order a tactical retreat, or have his Autobots fight the intruders despite his troops' low energy reserves. If he chose to stand and fight, he had the additional choice to either make the Autobots concentrate on Starscream, who is leading the charge against the Autobots, or divide his troops' attention onto all of the Decepticon assailants. If Optimus chose to attempt to eliminate Starscream once and for all, the Decepticon Seeker would beg for mercy, forcing Optimus into a choice yet again: accept the snivelling Decepticon's surrender, or continue his attempt to end Starscream's evil once and for all. Accepting Starscream's surrender spells victory for the Autobots, whereas ignoring Starscream pleas ultimately leads to Sparkplug being kidnapped by the Decepticons, necessitating Optimus to send Buster, Blaster and Bumblebee on a perilous retrieval mission while the other Autobots recharge at the Autobots' home base.
</p><p>Alternatively, if Optimus chose to retreat either when initially confronted with the overwhelming Decepticon threat, or after realizing that his troops are too weak to fight after ordering them to concentrate their firepower equally amongst the intruding Decepticons, the ensuing underground adventure can have multiple outcomes; the Autobots become the captive of the Insecticons, forcing Optimus to either entrust Beachcomber with the fate of his troops, or to bargain with the Insecticons for the safe release of his Autobots; or dealing with the theft of the Sun-Pak by either duelling Megatron for the device's ownership, stealing the Sun-Pak back from the Decepticons or charging Mirage and Buster with the device's retrieval. If Optimus duels Megatron for the device, he either wins through brute force or by being more "cunning" than Megatron and destroying the device before the Decepticons can claim it as their victory prize. If Optimus attempts to steal the Sun-Pak under the Decepticons' noses, Optimus is shot by Megatron when the Decepticon leader notices Optimus and Smokescreen skulking towards the Sun-Pak. The Autobots nonetheless retrieve it when Smokescreen blots out the sun with his emission fumes, forcing Megatron to pass the Sun-Pak towards Buzzsaw in order to bypass the Autobots' smog cover, only for Optimus to intercept Megatron's pass and drive away with the Sun-Pak in Autobot possession. Finally, if Optimus has entrusted the Sun-Pak's retrieval to Mirage and Buster, the Autobot leader makes the duo swear not to engage the enemy for fear of their safety. If his Autobots keep their promise to him, Optimus is called in alongside the rest of the Autobots when the Insecticons are discovered, and Optimus leads a successful ambush towards the Insecticons, at the cost of the Sun-Pak itself. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Attack_of_the_Insecticons" title="Attack of the Insecticons">Attack of the Insecticons</a></span>

<p>Optimus was enjoying the lull in Decepticon activity along with the rest of his Autobots, when he recommended that Beachcomber take a vacation. Beachcomber gladly accepted.
</p><p>In one possible scenario, Optimus was surprised to see Beachcomber return to Autobot headquarters soon after his departure. Beachcomber informed Optimus that he had uncovered the Decepticon's newest hidden fortress, and he suspected that the Decepticons were up to something big. Optimus sent out Beachcomber once more, this time along with Powerglide and Windcharger to investigate the Decepticons' plot further.
</p><p>Optimus then stood at the ready to send over reinforcements when called upon by Beachcomber's squad.
</p><p>In one possible sequence of events, Powerglide was captured and reprogrammed by the Decepticons, leading their army to Autobot headquarters. Taken by surprised, the Autobots were felled one by one until only Optimus remained. As Megatron gloated that he would not kill Optimus, only alter him so as to make him the bane of humanity, Optimus activated the Ark's self-destruct sequence, taking all of the Decepticons with him in a fiery explosion.
</p><p>In another possible sequence of events, the trio returned to Autobot headquarters to relate their findings to Optimus Prime. The Decepticons planned to use a Destruction Beam to create a fault line near Center City, which would in turn be exploited by Rumble's earthquake-inducing abilities to destroy the entire area. The Autobots then decided to split up in two groups, one to attack the Decepticons’ fortress, the other to stop Rumble in Center City. Optimus headed the lead team.
</p><p>If Optimus decided to send the lead team to attack the Decepticon headquarters, the team managed to infiltrate the Decepticon headquarters by using Beachcomber's knowledge of the secret doors’ location, and Brawn's strength to keep the doors opened. The Autobots then stormed the fortress, and Optimus maimed Megatron himself with a shot of his rifle. He then grappled the Decepticon leader, and forced him to lead himself, Inferno and Beachcomber to the Decepticons’ lab. There, the Autobots disabled and destroyed the Destruction Beam device, captured Megatron, and left many Decepticons permanently maimed. Though they later traded Megatron back to the Decepticons for the safe relief of the Autobots captured in Center City, the Autobots were ultimately victorious that day.
</p><p>If Optimus decided to send the lead team to defend Center City, he carries Cosmos in his trailer, so as not to cause a panic amongst the humans. Miserable in his current position, Cosmos asked Optimus to let him join the secondary team's attack on the fortress, where he felt he would be more helpful.
</p><p>If Optimus insisted that Cosmos stay with the group, the Autobots’ next objective would be to meet up with Sparkplug, with whom they consulted on whether the Autobots should enter Centre City in their <a href="/wiki/Robot_mode" title="Robot mode">robot modes</a> or in their <a href="/wiki/Alternate_mode" title="Alternate mode">vehicle modes</a>.
</p><p>If Sparkplug suggested that the Autobots not worry about subtlety, the entire squad transformed and began prowling the streets in search of Decepticons. Oblivious to the panic they were causing, Optimus assumed that the Decepticons were spotted nearby when a police officer declared that the city was under siege by giant robots. Unable to restore order in time to halt the Decepticons’ plot, Optimus and the rest of his team were destroyed in the ensuing earthquake.
</p><p>If Sparkplug suggested that the Autobots remained in their vehicle modes, he would concoct a plan where the Autobots would help evacuate the entire town in their vehicle modes. With no more than four trips in and out of the city, Optimus and the rest of the team carried out the plan without incident. The Autobots then transformed and engaged the approaching Decepticons, whom they easily dispatched. With the city safe, the Autobots moved out to help their comrades at the Decepticon fortress.
</p><p>In an alternate scenario, wherein Beachcomber, Windcharger and Powerglide were captured by the Decepticons while snooping around the secret fortress, Optimus was tricked into leading his troops to their doom by a false S.O.S. sent out by Megatron.
</p><p>In yet another possible scenario, Beachcomber returned from his day off early to inform Optimus that Jessie had been taken prisoner by the Decepticons. Optimus deployed a team of Autobots to go to the girl's rescue. Shortly before arriving at their destination, the Autobots had to choose their next course of action; they could either storm the Decepticon fortress by force, or try to sneak in through a secret passage Buster had previously discovered.
</p><p>If they decided to storm the fortress, Beachcomber would become nervous, and urge his fellow Autobots to find a more peaceful way to resolve the situation. Optimus sternly told him that this was not the time for one of his anti-war speeches. This moment of hesitation ultimately cost the Autobots the battle, and the Decepticons triumphed that day.
</p><p>If they decided a stealthier approach, the Autobots quietly entered the Decepticon base, and set out to shoot down any Decepticons they encountered, save Megatron, whom they planned to capture. After encountering some resistance from their foes, the Autobots came upon branch in the passageway, and had to choose to go left or right.
</p><p>If they took the right passageway, the group soon happened upon Jessie, whom they freed. Telling them she knew the location of the Decepticons’ lab, Jessie then led the group into a Decepticon trap; she had been brainwashed. The Autobots were captured and Megatron's plan to destroy Center City came to fruition.
</p><p>If they took the left passageway, the group happened upon Megatron's lab. Though Megatron attempted to trick Optimus into activating the Fortress's self-destruct sequence, Optimus was too clever to be duped. After deactivating both the Destruction beam and the Decepticons themselves, the Autobots found Jessie tied up in a cell. The Autobots then celebrated their victory by guzzling a few quarts of fine-grade oil.
</p><p>In a final possible path, wherein the Decepticons attempted to turn Beachcomber into a Decepticon double agent but fumbled the process, Optimus made Beachcomber into an Autobot double agent. With his help, the Autobots hoped to soon win their war with the Decepticons. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Earthquake_(book)" title="Earthquake (book)">Earthquake</a></span>

<p>When the Autobot-Decepticon civil war had yet to expand beyond Cybertron, Optimus had encountered a Decepticon weapon that weakened the gravitational pull within a confined area. The weapon being unreliable, Optimus had always assumed the Decepticons would not bother attempting to use it again.
</p><p>Now on Earth, Optimus was leading a group of his best scouts on a fuel-finding mission when they heard a tremendous explosion go off nearby. Optimus recognized the sound of the explosion as being Dirge's concussion missiles. Though Powerglide offered to go investigate the explosion, Optimus opted to send out Cosmos instead.
</p><p>If Cosmos radioed his findings to Optimus immediately, Optimus's convoy moved in to investigate a nearby Decepticon base. En route, the Autobots passed near a human town, but began floating in mid-air before being able to reach it. Optimus quickly deduced that this phenomenon was caused by an anti-gravity beam, courtesy of the Decepticons. Worried about the nearby humans also being affected by the lapse in gravity, Optimus had to decide whether he would order his troops to stop and help the townspeople, or to continue forward and attack the Decepticon base.
</p><p>If Optimus ordered his troops to come to the humans’ aid, they found themselves taking part in a struggle in futility, as the entire town was near-weightless, meaning they couldn't put the humans anywhere where they wouldn't float away once more. Then, the Autobots heard Decepticons approaching. Helpless in their current position, the Autobots were quickly eradicated by the Decepticons.
</p><p>If Optimus ordered his troops to attack the Decepticon base, they soon reached an area free of the anti-gravity beam's influence. They were then attacked by a small fleet of Decepticons. Optimus targeted their squad leader, Dirge, knowing that by downing him, the Decepticons would be significantly demoralized. Dirge was forced to break-off his attack when his back-up was taken out, knowing he wouldn't be able to take Optimus on without it. Losing their advantage quickly, the Decepticons retreated. But with the battle over, the Autobots noticed a small human boy at their feet. The boy was <a href="/wiki/Buddy" title="Buddy">Buddy</a>, a stowaway from the nearby town, and though Optimus was displeased with the tag-along, the Autobots could not spare the time to bring him home. Arriving at the Decepticon base, Megatron delivered an ultimatum; if the Autobots did not surrender Optimus Prime to the Decepticons immediately, he would use his gravity beam to have the nearby humans float off into space.
</p><p>If the Autobots decided to continue with their initial plan to simply attack the Decepticon base, their advance was halted by a force field. Megatron then fired his beam in all directions, causing a ripple effect that sent everything not fastened down to the Earth's surface to float helplessly out into space.
</p><p>Alternatively, the Autobots could concoct a plan where Optimus would pretend to allow himself to be taken prisoner, per Buddy's suggestion. The Decepticons, fooled into thinking they've won, took Optimus Prime into their base. Having hidden his troops inside his trailer, Optimus and the Autobots then led a surprise attack on their unsuspecting foes.
</p><p>In the event that Windcharger successfully turned the Decepticons’ forcefield off, reinforcements burst into the base just as Megatron was strike Optimus from behind. A wayward shot from Megatron then revealed the location of the gravity gun to the Autobots. Optimus ordered his troops to charge the weapon. Hook caught Optimus in the gravity gun's sights, and sent the Autobot leader floating upwards.
</p><p>If Buddy came to Optimus's rescue and toyed with the gravity gun's control panel just as Hook turned the weapon to full power, the weapon would swivel and catch Megatron in its beam, tearing the Decepticon leader to pieces instead of Optimus. The Autobots then proceeded to defeat the remaining Decepticons and claim victory.
</p><p>If Buddy instead cowered away, Cosmos came to Optimus's rescue. Optimus then instructed Cosmos to send him flying towards Hook; the pair took out the Constructicon, and gained control of the gravity beam.
</p><p>If Buddy and Tracks entered a space-time anomaly created during the battle, the Autobots would lose their stand-off against the Decepticons, and Optimus would be taken prisoner by Megatron.
</p><p>If Tracks decided that Beachcomber could wait, he helped Optimus overload the anti-gravity gun, starting a chain-reaction that would cause the weapon to explode in a tremendous explosion. Optimus instructed both Tracks and Buddy to run away as he finished tampering with the weapon.
</p><p>If Buddy lingered in wait for Optimus Prime to finish his task, Dirge flew by and dropped a missile onto Optimus, damaging his leg. Thankfully, Buddy assisted Optimus in repairing his leg. The pair then ran to safety as the anti-gravity gun self-destructed, taking a number of Decepticons with it.
</p><p>If Buddy ran off as Optimus sabotaged the anti-gravity gun, the boy was captured by Laserbeak, prompting Optimus to turn the gravity beam on the Decepticon to free Buddy.
</p><p>In a completely different possible sequence of events, wherein Cosmos had taken off to explore the Decepticon base on his own, Optimus was surprised to see two Cosmoses flying back towards his convoy some time later. Both Cosmoses declared themselves to be the real one, and urged Optimus to destroy the other.
</p><p>If Optimus destroyed the wrong Cosmos, the duplicate obliterated Optimus and his squad with the <a href="/wiki/Proton_bomb" title="Proton bomb">proton bomb</a> it housed within its body.
</p><p>If Optimus destroyed the duplicate Cosmos, the real one would inform the Autobots of the Decepticons’ schemes, and the convoy would roll out to take on their adversaries. They were soon met by a squad of flying Decepticons, but were at a strict disadvantage against their adversaries as their vehicle modes possessed no weapons. The Autobots nonetheless managed to fight their way to the Decepticons’ base, one way or another, and defeated the Decepticons by using their own gravity weapon against them. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Desert_Flight" title="Desert Flight">Desert Flight</a></span>

<p>Optimus was amongst the Autobots about to be topped up with their latest batch of fuel when Red Alert burst into Autobot headquarters, warning everyone about Ramjet being spotted nearby. Red Alert's warning came in just in time, as the Autobots’ fuel had been poisoned, and Optimus would have been left unable to transform had he ingested any of it.
</p><p>Optimus was advised of two plans; Perceptor suggested that the Autobots stay on the defensive while the scientist attempt to come up with a cure, while Prowl wanted the healthy Autobots to go out and try to find out what the Decepticons were up to.
</p><p>If Optimus went along with Perceptor's plan, he sent out Sparkplug to fetch the Autobots’ secret stash of emergency fuel. Putting all of his faith in the Autobot scientist to uncover a cure swiftly, Optimus attempted to comfort his troops as they all began to experience sickness pains. Then, Red Alert informed Optimus of a Decepticon attack force moving in on their position, prompting Optimus to ask Perceptor to dispense whatever cure he had been able to concoct, despite it being untested. Perceptor suggested another course of action to Optimus; the tainted fuel the Autobots had left untouched could be used to create a poisonous smog if lit aflame. The Autobots could attempt to poison the Decepticons with their own concoction, or they could risk the untested antidote, despite whatever side-effects it may have.
</p><p>If Optimus decided to risk Perceptor's antidote, he stood by as the Autobot scientist attempted to figure out how much antidote was a safe amount to give out to each Autobot.
</p><p>If Perceptor gave out the right amount of an antidote, the poisoned Autobots were cured. Optimus ordered his troops to ready themselves for the incoming squadron of Decepticons. Perceptor's antidote did have a side-effect on the Autobots, however; it gave them a fierce battle-fever, making them eager to take on the Decepticons head-on. Prowl suggested to Optimus that they instead opt for a more conniving counterstrike against the Decepticons, and ambush them instead.
</p><p>If Optimus allowed the cured Autobots to charge headlong into battle, he and the rest of the Autobots who were still running low on fuel stayed behind as back-up to the main charge. The Autobots’ first wave of warriors were quickly overpowered by the arrival of Megatron, prompting Optimus to lead the energy-depleated Autobots into the fray. Optimus's opening volley struck down Shockwave. Optimus and his troops soon found themselves running on empty, and Optimus called for a retreat. Thankfully, the Decepticons were damaged enough through the course of the battle, causing them to retreat as well.
</p><p>If Optimus instead followed Prowl's plan, he instructed his troops to transform into vehicle mode and play dead. The Decepticons, believing the Autobots’ ruse, disarmed themselves in order to carry out the Autobots’ “carcasses.” Now with the element of surprise against unarmed opponent, the Autobots Transformed and were able to easily defeat the evil robots.
</p><p>In another possible turn of events, Perceptor gave out too much of his antidote to each Autobot. The Autobots who received the antidote soon found themselves falling apart, leaving Optimus and the rest outmatched against the greater number of Decepticons.
</p><p>Alternatively, if Optimus chose to use the tainted fuel against the Decepticons, he ordered Grapple to carry out the vat outside of headquarters. He then instructed Grapple to lower the vat into a nearby pit, and instructed Jazz to torch the fuel with his flamethrower. He and Jazz waited until the last possible moment to carry out their plan, and once the fuel was lit, they dived to safety inside the Autobot base with the other Autobots. As the toxic cloud successfully turned away the Decepticons, Optimus was surprised to see Sunstreaker once more fully operational. Having been bought enough time, Perceptor was able to successfully cure the poisoned Autobots. Their ranks fully replenished and the Decepticons turning tail meant the Autobots had earned themselves another victory.
</p><p>In a completely different scenario, Optimus agreed to Prowl's plan to go on the offensive and try and discover the full extent of the Decepticons’ plans. Optimus nominated Prowl, Bumblebee and Mirage to go along with him on the mission. The group refuelled with the gas that Sparkplug brought back from the Autobots’ secret storage area, and took off. The group soon happened upon the Decepticons’ lab in the middle of a barren, polluted wasteland.
</p><p>If all four Autobots ventured together into the Decepticons’ lab, they first encountered Laserbeak, only to quickly dispatch him. Venturing further into the lab, the group soon spotted the antidote they were after, and sent Mirage to fetch it. Mirage returned with the beaker and news; he had heard Ramjet and Starscream talking about using a new poison to turn humans into mindless slaves.
</p><p>In light of this news, if Optimus decided to nonetheless head back directly to Autobot headquarters, his squad returned to find their comrades nearly dead from the poison. But with Ratchet's help, the antidote was quickly distributed, and the Autobots sprung back to life. Now cured, the Autobots discussed their next course of action; they had to prevent the Decepticons from poisoning the nearby water reservoir.
</p><p>If Optimus led his troops back to the Decepticons’ poison lab, the convoy happened upon the Decepticons hauling barrels of poison out of the poison lab. Windcharger and Ironhide suggested two different plans to Optimus: Windcharger wanted to use his magnetic powers to cause a confusion, while Ironhide wanted to simply go in for a full frontal assault.
</p><p>Whether Optimus decided to go with Windcharger or Ironhide's plan, the Autobots successfully destroyed the Decepticons’ lab and returned to base victoriously.
</p><p>Alternatively, if Optimus decided to head to the water reservoir instead of the Decepticons’ lab, the Autobots reached their destination only to find it already swarming with Decepticons. Powerglide then decided to go ahead on his own to lead the Decepticons away from the reservoir, but Optimus objected.
</p><p>If Powerglide did not heed Optimus orders, he indadvertedly caused the water supply to be poisoned anyways. If however, Powerglide listened to Optimus's orders, the Autobots attempted to lure the Decepticons away from the reservoir and into some nearby woods, where the Autobots would have some cover against the Decepticons. Finding themselves under heavy fire before they could reach the treeline, the Autobots were forced to fight back in the open. With Autobots falling beside him, Optimus gritted his teeth and took careful aim at the poison containers the Decepticons were carrying. After taking out both of the planes carrying the poison, Optimus continued to battle Megatron and his Decepticons until nightfall, until the Autobots were finally victorious.
</p><p>If however Optimus ordered his troops to deal with the Decepticons before returning to base with the antidote, Prowl suggested that he use his <a href="/wiki/Incendiary_missile" title="Incendiary missile">incendiary missiles</a> to destroy the poison first, but Optimus thought that course of action might be too risky. He considered dealing with Ramjet and Starscream first.
</p><p>If the Autobots went along with Prowl's strategy, the resulting heat from the explosion caused the Autobots’ circuits to overheat, rendering them unconscious. Upon reawakening, the Autobots found themselves captives of Megatron, who informed them that their fellow Autobots would soon perish, and that the humans would be conquered by the Decepticons shortly after.
</p><p>If Optimus instead decided to deal with Ramjet and Starscream first, his troop easily overpowered the pair, and made them watch as they destroyed their work. Optimus then taunted Ramjet and Starscream, telling them that the Autobots would soon be at full fighting force, before returning to Autobot headquarters with the antidote.
</p><p>If instead of all heading into the lab together, the Autobots had sent in Bumblebee alone, and Bumblebee subsequently managed to escape with the antidote to the Decepticons’ poison, the Autobots escaped from the <a href="/wiki/Decepticon_Poison_Lab" title="Decepticon Poison Lab">Valley of Poison</a> and returned to Autobot headquarters. Once the other Autobots were cured, they all drank a toast to Bumblebee, to celebrate his part in the mission <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Decepticon_Poison" title="Decepticon Poison">Decepticon Poison</a></span>

<p>After the Decepticons declared war, junior officer Optimus managed to turn the tide against them in a battle over <a href="/wiki/Iacon_(polity)" title="Iacon (polity)">Iacon</a>, and rose up in rank to become Autobot leader. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Official_Transformers:_Generation_2_Annual" title="The Official Transformers: Generation 2 Annual">Optimus Prime's <i>The Official Transformers: Generation 2 Annual</i> profile</a></span> His second-in-command, <a href="/wiki/Jazz_(G1)" title="Jazz (G1)">Jazz</a>, once saved his life after a surprise attack rendered him temporarily non-functional on the battlefront. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Official_Transformers:_Generation_2_Annual" title="The Official Transformers: Generation 2 Annual">Jazz's <i>The Official Transformers: Generation 2 Annual</i> profile</a></span> The war raged for centuries, with Cybertron's fuel sources steadily decreasing. Optimus ordered the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Ark_(G1)" title="Ark (G1)">Ark</a> to seek out new sources of energy, unaware that Megatron was building a ship of his own. The Ark's first foray into space was interrupted by a Decepticon attack, and all involved were too distracted to notice as they entered an asteroid belt. A collision between two meteorites sent the Transformers crashing into Earth. After countless eons of slumber, the Autobots awoke to a world populated by humans, and once more took up the fight against the Decepticons. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/From_Cybertron_to_Earth_the_War_Continues..." title="From Cybertron to Earth the War Continues...">From Cybertron to Earth the War Continues...</a></span>
</p><p>After a long period of stalemate, Prime grew frustrated at the lack of progress his troops were making against Megatron's forces. To remedy the situation, he ordered the creation of several new Transformers who would be perfectly adapted for combat on Earth. The first among these was <a href="/wiki/Manta_Ray_(G2)" title="Manta Ray (G2)">Pirhana</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Official_Transformers:_Generation_2_Annual" title="The Official Transformers: Generation 2 Annual">Piranha's <i>The Official Transformers: Generation 2 Annual</i> profile</a></span> But one of the Autobots' great victories came not through superior numbers or firepower, but trickery and cunning. As part of a plan devised by Optimus Prime's new second-in-command Prowl, the Autobots allowed <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)" title="Starscream (G1)">Starscream</a> to "overhear" that they had uncovered an ancient Cybertronian ship with the means to return to Cybertron. They then stationed themselves around the vessel, atop of <a href="/wiki/Table_Mountain" title="Table Mountain">Table Mountain</a> in <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, and awaited the inevitable Decepticon attack over its possession. Optimus met Megatron in battle, but ordered his troops to withdraw after a brief skirmish, declaring the Decepticons too powerful to hold back. Once the Decepticons claimed their prized and entered the ship, they found themselves locked inside it. The ship then shot up away from the planet, leaving the Decepticons without the means to control it. Though the Autobots knew this wouldn't rid them permanently of the Decepticons, they were satisfied with a brief period of calm while they were off-world. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Day_of_the_Decepticons" title="Day of the Decepticons">Day of the Decepticons</a></span>
</p><p>When the Ark's sensors picked up two Transformer power emissions in the <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> rain forest of non-Decepticon origin, Optimus headed into the field to investigate, bringing along <a href="/wiki/Jazz_(G1)" title="Jazz (G1)">Jazz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fizzle" title="Fizzle">Blaze</a>. Though their search went poorly at first, the surrounding vegetation interfering with their energy trackers, one of the mystery Transformers soon found them! The source of the readings turned out to be two terrifying <a href="/wiki/Dinobot_(G1)" title="Dinobot (G1)">robot dinosaurs</a>! As Optimus charged one of them, <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a> and his troops turned up, and blasted the Autobot leader unconscious.

<p>Under the eerie shadows of a full moon Optimus Primal, a gigantic bat, <a href="/wiki/Cheetor_(BW)" title="Cheetor (BW)">Cheetor</a>, a swift-stalking cheetah, and <a href="/wiki/Razorbeast" title="Razorbeast">Razorbeast</a>, a fearsome wild boar, hunted purposely through the depths of a jungle.

His motion sensors registered what appeared to be a harmless <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> creature below.
</p><p>Before Optimus realized his mistake, the crocodile lashed out with as smashing swipe of its tail, knocking Optimus into the swampy waters. The beast transformed and <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(BW)" title="Megatron (BW)">Megatron</a> towered above him. The building ahead was the Predacons' genetics lab and he'd never let Optimus reach the secrets inside. He ordered his troops to attack and everyone transformed to robot mode. The gigantic arthropods Tarantulas and Waspinator engaged Razorbeast and Cheetor respectively while Optimus and Megatron faced off.

Megatron responded that his side did all that too, so nan-neh, but used the DNA of Earth's most vicious predators. When Optimus noted that the Maximals seemed to be getting the upper hand, Megatron immediately detonated the lab and escaped, vowing to return with new forms and new plans when the Maximals least expected it.

</p><p>After passing the Matrix to Ultra Magnus and expiring in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Autobot_City" title="Battle of Autobot City">battle of Autobot City</a>, Optimus Prime found himself in <a href="/wiki/Maccadam%27s_Old_Oil_House" title="Maccadam's Old Oil House">Maccadam's Old Oil House</a>.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Dreamwave_Generation_One_continuity" title="Dreamwave Generation One continuity">one reality</a>, while the Autobots were boarding the Ark, Optimus voiced his lack of confidence in his leadership, before welcoming aboard <a href="/wiki/Geosensus" title="Geosensus">Geosensus</a>, who was incapable of transforming to <a href="/wiki/Robot_mode" title="Robot mode">robot mode</a>. Four million years later, Prime and <a href="/wiki/Prowl_(G1)" title="Prowl (G1)">Prowl</a> found the Ark was under attack and defended it with deadly force. In examining the wreckage of the attackers, they realised that the robot Optimus had destroyed was not a Decepticon but Geosensus, who had forced himself to transform in an attempt to fight off the Decepticons.

<p>Having been caught unaware by a surprise attack launched by the Decepticons, Optimus led his troops in a losing battle against their mortal enemies. Though Optimus managed to dispatch a few Decepticons, namely Thrust, whom he punched through the chest, he soon found himself crippled and surrounded by enemy forces. Praying to Primus as the Decepticons readied their weapons, Optimus heard Grimlock calling out to his fellow Dinobots to combine, prompting the Autobot leader to yell out a plead to Grimlock to stop. It was too late, however, and <a href="/wiki/Beast_(G1)" title="Beast (G1)">The Beast</a> began rampaging, killing Autobots and Decepticons alike. Taking advantage of the situation nonetheless, Optimus tackled Megatron and began beating on the Decepticon leader. The tide of the battle now shifted, Optimus attempted to reach Grimlock's consciousness within The Beast so that its mindless carnage could come to a halt. It didn't work. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Beast_Within" title="The Beast Within">The Beast Within</a></span> 
</p><p>As the battle wore on, Optimus attempted to drive the Autobots too wounded to outrun the Beast themselves to safety, carrying them within his trailer. Jetfire showed up in time to rescue most of his passengers, leaving Optimus to deal with The Beast on his own. Seeing a city coming closer over the horizon, Optimus attempted to reach the Dinobots one last time from within The Beast. As his former troops remained unresponsive, Optimus led The Beast to its doom, blasting it a few more times before leading it to fall into a chasm. Optimus himself was rescued from the fall at the last possible moment by Jetfire's timely return. As the two of them looked on at the Beast's inert form, Optimus wondered out loud if their battles would truly ever come to an end. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Beast_Within_Part_2,_Consequences" title="The Beast Within Part 2, Consequences">The Beast Within Part 2, Consequences</a></span>

<p>As he and Prowl discussed the wisdom of evacuating, a huge explosion obliterated the <a href="/wiki/Forum_of_Enlightenment" title="Forum of Enlightenment">Forum of Enlightenment</a>. Optimus led a team there, realising that the destruction was a message from Megatron. Leaving his team, he ventured underground, encountering <a href="/wiki/Shrapnel_(G1)" title="Shrapnel (G1)">Shrapnel</a>, who blasted him into a pit. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_War_Within_issue_2" title="The War Within issue 2">The War Within #2</a></span> Exploring the underground, Prime had a strange vision of a transparent version of himself, which warned that he had to grasp Cybertron's significance. Then he was attacked by <a href="/wiki/Soundwave_(G1)" title="Soundwave (G1)">Soundwave</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Insecticon_(G1)" title="Insecticon (G1)">Insecticons</a>, whom he was able to easily best by using the labyrinthine environment to his advantage.

Before he could look for a way out, Megatron found him, and informed him about the true nature of the Matrix, telling Optimus how it could be used to power Cybertron's planetary engines, transforming it into a space-faring war-world. This spurred Optimus to fight back, but before long, Megatron took control of the battle, smashing his fist into Prime's chest to get at the Matrix. A blaze of light enveloped the pair, who found themselves abruptly on 20th century <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_War_Within_issue_4" title="The War Within issue 4">The War Within #4</a></span>

The nature of their surroundings established, Megatron resumed the scheduled beating, but a series of setting shifts ended with Optimus reunited with <a href="/wiki/Grimlock_(G1)" title="Grimlock (G1)">Grimlock</a>.

Though he did not slay Megatron, he inflicted enough damage onto him to expunge from his memory the visions the Matrix had granted him. A short time later, Optimus joined the other Autobots in attacking the Decepticons who were trying to use Cybertron's planetary engines. Grimlock was finally impressed with Prime. Thanks to the combined efforts of Optimus and Grimlock's squad, the Decepticons were driven away and the engines were destroyed before they could tear the planet apart. Afterwards, Optimus's group arrived back at <a href="/wiki/Iacon_(polity)" title="Iacon (polity)">Iacon</a> to find it destroyed.

<p>Following the awakening of the Transformers on Earth, the Autobots protected the planet from the Decepticons. Over the next fifteen years, the Autobots befriended the humans, particularly the <a href="/wiki/Witwicky_(surname)" title="Witwicky (surname)">Witwicky family</a>. The Autobots finally allied with humankind and eventually defeated the Decepticons at the turn of the century. They planned to return to Cybertron aboard the newly constructed <i><a href="/wiki/Ark_II" title="Ark II">Ark II</a></i>, along with <a href="/wiki/Magnificent_Seven" title="Magnificent Seven">seven humans</a>, including Witwicky patriarch <a href="/wiki/Sparkplug_Witwicky" title="Sparkplug Witwicky">Sparkplug</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_1" title="Prime Directive issue 1">Prime Directive #1</a></span> Before the ship departed, Prime gave a piece of the Matrix to <a href="/wiki/Spike_Witwicky_(G1)" title="Spike Witwicky (G1)">Spike Witwicky</a>, Sparkplug's son and <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)" title="Bumblebee (G1)">Bumblebee</a>'s closest human friend. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_2" title="Prime Directive issue 2">Prime Directive #2</a></span> But the ship was destroyed as part of a military conspiracy to take control of the Transformers.
</p><p>Optimus Prime's body was hauled out of the Arctic Ocean by the US military. While a terrorist organization run by the enigmatic <a href="/wiki/Lazarus" title="Lazarus">Lazarus</a> was able to seize control of several of the other Transformers that fell back to Earth, the military worked unsuccessfully to reactivate Prime. They eventually called in Spike Witwicky. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_1" title="Prime Directive issue 1">Prime Directive #1</a></span> Spike was forced by the project chief, General <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hallo" title="Robert Hallo">Robert Hallo</a>, to use his piece of the Matrix to reactivate Prime. Functional again, Prime used the Matrix to reactivate more of his fallen comrades. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_2" title="Prime Directive issue 2">Prime Directive #2</a></span>
</p><p>The Autobots helped repair a <a href="/wiki/Smitco_Oil_Refinery" title="Smitco Oil Refinery">Smitco Oil Refinery</a> site which the Lazarus-controlled Transformers had attacked. Optimus had no answer for Spikes accusation that the Transformers' presence on Earth was responsible for the destruction. When Megatron's activities at Lazarus's base were spotted by the military, Optimus insisted on the Autobots going in without backup. They discovered Megatron in the middle of a plan to reformat Earth into a new Cybertron using a <a href="/wiki/Cyber-virus" title="Cyber-virus">cyber-virus</a>. Optimus rejected Megatron's suggestion he should just let it happen, but while the two factions fought, the human military unleashed <a href="/wiki/Operation_Clean-Up" title="Operation Clean-Up">Operation Clean-Up</a>, dropping a bomb on them. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_3" title="Prime Directive issue 3">Prime Directive #3</a></span>
</p><p>The energy of the explosion absorbed by the virus, the Autobots dug themselves out and set about recovering their fellows whom Megatron had used to power the cyber-virus in its early stages. <a href="/wiki/Ironhide_(G1)" title="Ironhide (G1)">Ironhide</a> passed on a message from Megatron — there was a surprise in store for the Autobot leader.

<p>Never one to give up, Optimus managed to down Devastator in return, only to find himself at Megatron's mercy. The Decepticon leader pointed out to him the humans' self-obsessed behavior in the face of the devastation, suggesting the fleshlings were worthless, and the Autobots should join the Decepticons in wiping them out. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_5" title="Prime Directive issue 5">Prime Directive #5</a></span> The heroic actions of a team of firefighters and other humans proved to Optimus that the humans were worth saving, and the Autobots delivered a smackdown on the Decepticons. The fight was interrupted by the news that a nuclear missile was inbound, and despite Prime's protests, Superion sacrificed himself intercepting it. Prime recovered from the shock wave to find that the Decepticons had fled. He appealed to Grimlock to return to the Autobot ranks, an offer turned down by the Dinobot. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive_issue_6" title="Prime Directive issue 6">Prime Directive #6</a></span>

<p>Optimus started to feel a sense of unease, as if something bad was looming on the horizon for the Autobots. He was discussing these feelings with Spike when he suddenly suffered a seizure and fell off a cliff. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_Volume_2_Preview" title="Transformers Volume 2 Preview">Transformers Volume 2 Preview</a></span> Following this, Prime began to experience subconscious urgings, leading both the Autobots and the Decepticons to the Arctic Circle, where Shockwave arrived to greet them—and arrest them as war criminals. Shockwave had succeeded in ending the war on Cybertron, and brought a team of <a href="/wiki/Triple_Changer" title="Triple Changer">Triple Changers</a> to apprehend them. As Optimus stared down <a href="/wiki/Blitzwing_(G1)" title="Blitzwing (G1)">Blitzwing</a>'s cannon barrel, he was saved by Grimlock, though he subsequently had to order a retreat. Prowl convinced him to let a small team stay as recon while the others returned to the <a href="/wiki/Ark_(G1)" title="Ark (G1)">Ark</a> and discussed the change in situation. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/New_World_Order" title="New World Order">New World Order</a></span> Though Optimus was puzzled by <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)" title="Ultra Magnus (G1)">Ultra Magnus</a> having fallen in with Shockwave, he had little other choice, and surrendered to Magnus. Despite being bound, he took the first opportunity he got to make his feelings clear.

</p><p>Stewing in a cell, Optimus blamed himself for their predicament, but he and the Autobots were soon rescued by <a href="/wiki/Broadside_(G1)" title="Broadside (G1)">Broadside</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sandstorm_(G1)" title="Sandstorm (G1)">Sandstorm</a>.

<p>Optimus was able to rally Autobot factions from across Cybertron to the cause and launch an all-out attack on Shockwave's fortress. He headed the assault himself, but broke rank when he saw the image of Shockwave blasting Ultra Magnus upon one of the many monitor screens planted around the Decepticon's headquarters. Optimus charged in to confront Shockwave, beating down all opposition along the way. Coming upon Shockwave's throne room, Prime was greeted by Ultra Magnus, who pointed him towards a secret passage through which Shockwave had absconded. Leaving his wounded brother to rest, Optimus barged into Shockwave's secret chambers, only to be overpowered and have the Matrix ripped from his chest.

</p><p>Several Autobots and Decepticons, including Optimus Prime, were reformatted into will-less war machines under the control of <a href="/wiki/Cobra" title="Cobra">Cobra</a>. During an initial attack on a human peace conference, Cobra's remote control of Optimus (whom they had nicknamed "<a href="/wiki/HISS_tank" title="HISS tank" class="mw-redirect">HISS-14</a>") mysteriously failed. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/G.I._Joe_vs._the_Transformers_issue_1" title="G.I.

<p>After the Transformers and humans were returned to present-day Cybertron and the Decepticons were vanquished by the recently arrived <a href="/wiki/Dinobot_(G1)" title="Dinobot (G1)">Dinobots</a>, Prime made an agreement with the Joes to destroy the technology that started the whole mess in order to protect Earth. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/G.I._Joe_vs._the_Transformers_II_issue_4" title="G.I.

</p><p>On Cybertron, Optimus Prime kicked back to do a little bit of paperwork and reminisce. With Shockwave defeated, Cybertron was enjoying a new era of peace. He was interrupted by Hot Rod, who reported that a group of "pesky humans with their peashooters" were giving an Autobot team on Earth a hard time. Prime suspected Cobra's involvement and counseled Hot Rod not to be so dismissive of the humans. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_War_issue_1" title="The Art of War issue 1">The Art of War #1</a></span> When the team returned to Cybertron and mysteriously vanished in the <a href="/wiki/Gladiator_Zone" title="Gladiator Zone">Gladiator Zone</a>, Prime was prepared to go search for them, but was convinced by Hot Rod to stay behind and organize a peace ceremony. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_War_issue_2" title="The Art of War issue 2">The Art of War #2</a></span>

Serpent O.R. offered Optimus a trade: hostages and peace if he handed over the Matrix. Optimus agreed.
</p><p>In his stronghold, Serpent O.R. questioned Prime about his own worthiness to carry the Matrix, but Optimus broke free of his chains and aggressively ordered him to surrender. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_War_issue_4" title="The Art of War issue 4">The Art of War #4</a></span> A group of Decepticons broke in and nearly took Prime apart, but not before Serpent O.R. took the Matrix for himself and changed into the massive Serpentor Prime. The Matrix showed Serpentor Prime the error of his ways but as he was about to commit suicide Cobra Commander tripped a device and took over Serpentor Prime's body. Moments before he crushed Arcee, a severely damaged Optimus Prime threw Hawk toward the Matrix but warned the human not to touch the artifact. Hawk did so anyway and through a quasi-mystical transfer of power Serpentor Prime was vanquished.
</p><p>Later repaired by a <a href="/wiki/Paradron_Medic" title="Paradron Medic">female nursebot</a>, Optimus went back to finishing his paperwork.

</p><p>Sensing a new, yet old, danger to planet Earth, Prime elected to send himself to earth on an investigation, and gave Hot Rod a glare when the young Autobot accused his leader of taking an unnecessary risk to atone for the death of a <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)" title="Bumblebee (G1)">close friend</a>.

Prime whacked him with his <a href="/wiki/Energon-axe" title="Energon-axe">energon-axe</a> and in return Bludgeon bearhugged him and coated him in metal-eating slime. Hawk, still carrying power from the Matrix, helped Prime break free. Optimus then shot his way into the hidden kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Cobra-La" title="Cobra-La">Cobra-La</a>.

<p>While they wandered through the tunnels, the Joes and Prime found cave paintings that described the last visit to Earth by the planet-eating god <a href="/wiki/Unicron" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>. They were attacked again by Bludgeon and Cobra-La minions, but were led away by a ragged <a href="/wiki/Joe_Colton" title="Joe Colton">Joe Colton</a>, prisoner of Cobra-La for the last 25 years. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Black_Horizon,_Part_1_of_2" title="Black Horizon, Part 1 of 2">Black Horizon, Part 1 of 2</a></span> Bludgeon managed to find them again and during a second battle Prime tore open the Pretender's shell, revealing Bludgeon's robot form inside. Bludgeon tripped and dangled dangerously over a chasm, but rather than let Optimus Prime save him, Bludgeon forced Prime to drop him to his death laughing all the way down.
</p><p>The Joes discovered a cavern where the people of Cobra-La were growing <a href="/wiki/Metal-eating_spore" title="Metal-eating spore">metal-eating spores</a> as a last defense against Unicron. Flint and <a href="/wiki/Cosmos_(G1)" title="Cosmos (G1)">Cosmos</a> took a load of the spores into space just as Unicron appeared in Earth orbit. Prime, Hawk and Colton headed deeper into Cobra-La to rescue <a href="/wiki/Firewall" title="Firewall">Firewall</a> and kick butt.

He then took the machine-hating Cobra-La leader <a href="/wiki/Golobulus" title="Golobulus">Golobulus</a> to task with a single punch.

<p>Optimus Prime was originally known as Orion Pax, a police captain from <a href="/wiki/Rodion" title="Rodion">Rodion</a>. An encounter with a pre-<a href="/wiki/Decepticon" title="Decepticon">Decepticon</a> <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)/2005_IDW_continuity" title="Megatron (G1)/2005 IDW continuity">Megatron</a> would change the course of his life, teaching him that freedom was not just the right of all "civilised" beings, but of all <i>sentient</i> beings, and causing him to publicly reclaim the name "Autobot", previously used only at Cybertronians as a derogatory term, before the corrupt Senate.
</p><p>After the rise of the Decepticons and the death of the merciless <a href="/wiki/Zeta_Prime_(G1)" title="Zeta Prime (G1)">Zeta Prime</a>, he became the Prime, and entered what would become a millions-of-years-long war of attrition with the Decepticons, which would lead to the death of <a href="/wiki/Cybertron_(planet)" title="Cybertron (planet)">Cybertron</a> and the spreading of the Cybertronian civil war far beyond their homeworld in a push for resources. With the end of the war and the emptying of the <a href="/wiki/Matrix_of_Leadership" title="Matrix of Leadership">Matrix of Leadership</a> to restart <a href="/wiki/Vector_Sigma" title="Vector Sigma">Vector Sigma</a> and rebirth Cybertron, he found himself rejected by the returning civilian population, and - secretly gladly - abdicated his rank and returned to his original name of Orion Pax as he travelled through the galaxy.

After killing <a href="/wiki/Nova_Prime" title="Nova Prime">Nova Prime</a> he proudly retook the mantle of Prime, convinced by Rodimus that he had redeemed it, and seemingly destroyed Shockwave to save all of time and space.

Despite having learned from the sins of his ancestors, Prime found himself confronted by the ultimate example of their hubris: the threat of <a href="/wiki/Unicron/Generation_1" title="Unicron/Generation 1">Unicron</a>, a wepaon created by "<a href="/wiki/Onyx_Prime" title="Onyx Prime">Onyx Prime</a>—" in reality, a time-travelling Shockwave, who had deliberately engineered the rise and fall of the entire Prime lineage. Despite Prime's best efforts, Cybertron was destroyed, and Orion—shedding the title of "Prime" in his final moments—sacrificed his life to end what Shockwave had begun all those years ago, allowing both humans and Cybertronians to begin anew on Earth.

<p>When the legendary <a href="/wiki/Energon_Cube" title="Energon Cube" class="mw-redirect">Energon Cube</a> was lost to the reaches of space, Optimus Prime led a small team of Autobots in pursuit of it. The giant energy source crashed on Earth in the Japanese town of <a href="/wiki/Hoshinoch%C5%8D" title="Hoshinochō">Hoshinochō</a>, where it shattered into fragments that were scattered far and wide. Prime and the other Autobots set up a subterranean base below the Cube's impact crater and began their search for the shards, taking the forms of local vehicles to hide their activities. Despite their attempts at remaining unseen, glimpses of the Autobots only magnified the reputation the crash of the Cube (believed by humans to be a meteor) had given Hoshinochō: that of a hotbed of rumored alien and UFO activity, Japan's answer to <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">America</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Roswell" title="Roswell">Roswell</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Giants" title="Kingdom of Giants">Kingdom of Giants</a></span>

Prime opened fire, but Megatron merely used the defeated Starscream for a shield, then turned his cannon on the younger duo.

</p><p>Prime invited Wataru to visit the Autobots' subterranean base, and he gave the boy a personal tour as he carried the injured Bumblebee to the infirmary. Telling him the story of the Energon Cube and the Autobots' coming to Earth, Prime showed Wataru the large chunk of the cube that they had managed to recover. He then turned his attention to repairing Bumblebee's wounds, and as such, did not notice Wataru reaching out to touch the cube sliver. A bizarre energy discharge resulted that not only showed the Autobots images of <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Generation_1_cartoon_continuity" title="Japanese Generation 1 cartoon continuity">Another Time &amp; Place</a>, but also healed both Autobots' wounds.

Prime and Wataru headed out to investigate a local relic that Kihara suspected was a cube shard, and Wataru's powers soon confirmed the doctor's findings. Just as Prime was about to report back to Kihara, however, Megatron struck, demanding that Prime hand over both the shard and Wataru. Prime attempted to feign ignorance of Wataru's powers, but Megatron ignored his bluff and encouraged him to hand the boy over, lest he cost <i>another</i> Booster their life. Driven into a rage by the stinging barb, Prime violently attacked Megatron with his energon-axe, but as the duel raged, Megatron continued to question Prime's beliefs and his attitude. Unable to deny Megatron's accusation that he had hoped to use Wataru's power to defeat him, Prime lost his concentration and was taken down by the Decepticon leader. Despite what he had learned about a previous Booster dying, Wataru stayed true to Optimus and activated his powers, healing the Autobot's wounds and powering up his energon-axe into a huge sword. Summoning all his energy, Prime took down Megatron with one almighty slash, then collapsed into <a href="/wiki/Stasis_lock" title="Stasis lock">stasis lock</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime%27s_Secret" title="Optimus Prime's Secret">Optimus Prime's Secret</a></span>

With his men taking a pummeling, the unconscious Prime had a vision of Akira, who spurred him on to awaken and rejoin the battle. With another power boost from Wataru, Prime unleashed a super-charged shot from his ion blaster that took down the fleeing Decepticons. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Time_of_Resurrection" title="Time of Resurrection">Time of Resurrection</a></span>

<p>In 2007, the Optimus Prime of <a href="/wiki/Universal_stream" title="Universal stream">universal stream</a> <a href="/wiki/Primax_109.0_Beta" title="Primax 109.0 Beta">Primax 109.0 Beta</a> encountered a mysterious messenger from another world: <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)/Generation_1_cartoon_continuity#Alternity" title="Optimus Prime (G1)/Generation 1 cartoon continuity">another incarnation of himself</a> from <a href="/wiki/BT_World" title="BT World">a parallel dimension</a> who left him with a warning. Two years hence, Megatron would bring the terrifying super-dimensional lifeform known as the "Beast of Time", the <a href="/wiki/Hytherion" title="Hytherion">Hytherion</a>, into their dimension to destroy Earth. The only thing that could battle the Hytherion was the power of the super-evolved multi-dimensional race of Cybertronians known as the <a href="/wiki/Alternity_(species)" title="Alternity (species)">Alternity</a>. Prime agreed that when the danger appeared, he would join the Alternity in the fight.
</p><p>Sure enough, in 2009, when the Hytherion's colossal claw-marks appeared on planets throughout the solar system, Prime's other-dimensional incarnation returned, bringing with him a "Vibrant Red" Vector 109 <a href="/wiki/Auto-avatar" title="Auto-avatar">auto-avatar</a> with which Prime fused. In that instant, he was reborn as part of the Alternity, a manifold being who encompassed all the different incarnations of Optimus Prime through the multiverse at once. Prime reached his hands heavenward and peeled back the layers of reality, exposing the gargantuan fanged maw of the Hytherion looming above the Autobots. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/From_Here_to_Alternity" title="From Here to Alternity">From Here to Alternity</a></span>
</p><p>Optimus battled alongside the Alternity to fend off the beast, when unexpectedly, <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)#Alternity" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a> overwrote the beast's higher functions with his own. At first, it seemed that the Hytherion had been killed, but a newly empowered Megatron (in two bodies) appeared and declared that, now possessing a power that rivaled the Alternity's, he challenged his opponents to take him on or see the multiverse itself burn. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/To_Mega_Therion" title="To Mega Therion">To Mega Therion</a></span>
</p><p>As battles between numerous different Primes and Megatrons erupted quite literally all across time and space, another member of the <a href="/wiki/Convoy_Aggregate" title="Convoy Aggregate">Convoy Aggregate</a> was later seen battling <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)#Alternity" title="Starscream (G1)">Starscream</a>, who had been empowered by Megatron to serve as leader of his <a href="/wiki/Questor" title="Questor">Questors</a>. This Prime was so surprised by Starscream's uncharacteristic sports car alternate mode that he left himself open for a blast from Starscream's Retroactive Nullifer cannon, which erased him from the timestream. As he faded out of existence, Prime responded to Starscream's taunts about the death of the Alternity by telling him that they were already well aware of their prophesied end and were well prepared. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Foreshadows" title="Foreshadows">Foreshadows</a></span>
</p><p>Optimus was providing cover-fire for a cross-universal battle when he suddenly seized up. Though he rebooted momentarily, he had terrible news for his Protector allies: using the power of the lower-dimensional <a href="/wiki/Planicron" title="Planicron">Planicrons</a>, Megatron had succeeded in sundering the Alternity's aggregate! Optimus urged his subordinates to not lose hope however, reassuring them that events were still unfolding within the parameters they had foretold. Sure enough, the battle swayed back in the Autobots' favor when <a href="/wiki/Thundercracker_(G1)#Alternity" title="Thundercracker (G1)">Thundercracker</a>, disgusted by Megatron's reckless use of their power, freed the Planicrons and robbed Megatron of his most powerful weapon. Optimus then tasked <a href="/wiki/Arcee_(Energon)" title="Arcee (Energon)">Elita Seven</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nemesis_Prime_(Universe)" title="Nemesis Prime (Universe)">the black Convoy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)/Generation_1_cartoon_continuity" title="Bumblebee (G1)/Generation 1 cartoon continuity">Bumblebee</a> to track down the <a href="/wiki/Critias_Gate" title="Critias Gate">doorway</a> that would allow the Planicrons to ascend to the higher-dimensions, putting them on the path to supersede the Alternity as multiversal protectors. While they attended to this task, the rest of the now-former Alternity busied themselves by destroying Megatron's auto-avatars, weakening the villain and disallowing him from interfering further with the Planicrons' destiny.

While Bumblebee and Cyclonus fought, Prime made a surprise attack and took out Cyclonus with his Ion-axe, before turning his attention to Megatron.

<p>In a world where the Transformers' war settled into a series of friendly competitive races known as the <a href="/wiki/Transformers_GT_(race)" title="Transformers GT (race)">Transformers GT</a>, Optimus Prime became the <a href="/wiki/GT_Transformer" title="GT Transformer">GT Transformer</a> known as <b>GT-R Prime</b>.

<p>Optimus and his Autobots were aboard the Ark, on the run from the Decepticons. With him, Optimus had what Megatron was forever seeking; the <a href="/wiki/AllSpark" title="AllSpark">AllSpark</a>! With the ship taking heavy damage from the Autobots' pursuers, Optimus ordered Jazz to take them into an emergency quantum jump. Jazz informed Prime that the jump would take longer to initiate than the time the Decepticons would need to board their vessel. As such, Optimus entrusted the AllSpark to Bumblebee while he and the rest of the bridge crew steeled themselves to hold off their enemies. Thanks to Starscream breaking rank in the Decepticons' formation, Optimus was able to hold back Megatron, and with <a href="/wiki/Heatwave_(G1)" title="Heatwave (G1)">Heatwave</a>'s help, repel them from the ship just as it initiated the quantum jump. However, at that moment the AllSpark tumbled off-ship, falling into the quantum tunnel and seemingly being lost for good... <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Angry_Birds_Transformers_issue_1" title="Angry Birds Transformers issue 1">Angry Birds Transformers #1</a></span>
</p><p>Optimus led the search for the AllSpark through space, but he and his troops were unable to locate the artifact.

At that moment, a <a href="/wiki/Minion_Pig" title="Minion Pig">strange green pig</a> crashed through one of the ship's windows, with the AllSpark in tow.

</p><p>At the final battle against the <a href="/wiki/Decepticon_Empire" title="Decepticon Empire">Decepticon Star Empire</a> on <a href="/wiki/Mirtonia" title="Mirtonia">Mirtonia</a>, Prime and his <a href="/wiki/Firestormer" title="Firestormer">Firestormer Squadron</a> emerged victorious, though the battle concluded with an experimental energon refinery exploding and blasting the General and <a href="/wiki/Hound_(G1)" title="Hound (G1)">Sergeant Hound</a> out of their own reality into <a href="/wiki/Nexus_208.0_Epsilon" title="Nexus 208.0 Epsilon">Nexus 208.0 Epsilon</a>. 
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Axiom_Nexus" title="Axiom Nexus">Axiom Nexus</a>, General Optimus Prime found himself inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Convoy_(group)" title="Convoy (group)">Convoy</a>, a group of Optimus Primes and their kin dedicated to safeguarding the <a href="/wiki/Multiverse" title="Multiverse">multiverse</a>. While the other Convoy members tended to stay in the upper reaches of Axiom Nexus, the General was able to use his unusual appearance for an Optimus Prime to venture in the Offworlder zones without suspicion, a great help to <a href="/wiki/Axiom_Nexus_Security_Administration" title="Axiom Nexus Security Administration">Offworlder Zone Security Administration</a> Commander <a href="/wiki/Cheetor_(TransTech)" title="Cheetor (TransTech)">Cheetor</a>. The General was also assisted in his new mission by his longtime scout, Sergeant Hound. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)/toys#Timelines" title="Optimus Prime (G1)/toys">General Optimus Prime profile card</a></span> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Hound_(G1)/toys#Timelines" title="Hound (G1)/toys">Sgt.

</p><p>When Sergeant Hound apprehended a criminal going by the name "<a href="/wiki/Megatron_(Movie)" title="Megatron (Movie)">C-81</a>", rumors that the prisoner was in reality a "Megatron" that had gotten past the TransTechs' <a href="/wiki/Dux_non_Intruitus" title="Dux non Intruitus">security procedures</a> piqued General Optimus Prime's interest. Though Cheetor assured him that it was impossible for a "Megatron" to have been allowed in Axiom Nexus, the General's concerns did not fade. More pressing concerns took over, however, when the entirety of Axiom Nexus, and nearly all of the TransTechs suffered a sudden shutdown due to a surge in the Global Net. General Optimus Prime tasked <a href="/wiki/Bruticus_(RID)" title="Bruticus (RID)">Bruticus</a> with keeping guard over the prison while he and Hound went to investigate the source of the surge, the planet's core.
</p><p>When Optimus and Hound eventually made their way there, they found that C-81 and his gang of criminals had escaped prison and were combating the <a href="/wiki/Waruder" title="Waruder">Waruder</a> soldiers responsible for the planetary shutdown. Optimus mistakenly assumed that C-81 and his goons were there on purpose, and joined them in fending off the invaders. They were soon joined by <a href="/wiki/Burn_Out_(Diaclone)" title="Burn Out (Diaclone)">Burn Out</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lift-Ticket_(Diaclone)" title="Lift-Ticket (Diaclone)">Lift-Ticket</a>, who informed the Cybertronians that they had stumbled across the Waruders' main hive. Lift-Ticket explained the Waruders could be repelled if he managed to get a sample of the hive's venom. Optimus was willing to go along with Lift-Ticket's dangerous plan, despite C-81's skepticism. However, the battle came to an end when C-81 managed to grab a hold of the Waruders' <a href="/wiki/Beet-Chit" title="Beet-Chit">leader</a>, and forced the bug into peaceful negotiations. Optimus agreed to allow the Waruders to migrate to another Cybertron via C-81's illegal interuniversal gate, in exchange for a venom sample that would be used to create an anti-toxin to revive the TransTech. The General nonetheless impounded C-81's gate afterwards, though he did let the criminals "slip away" as thanks for their part in thwarting the Waruder invasion.
</p><p>General Optimus Prime later attended a meeting of the Convoy held by <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(TransTech)" title="Starscream (TransTech)">Starscream</a>. There, he assured the others present that he had been mistaken about the rumored Megatron's identity. Starscream was convinced, but the rest of the Convoy were savvy to the truth. The other Optimuses supported General Optimus Prime's decision, stating that if C-81 had earned the General's trust, that was good enough for the rest of them.

<p>As the two Titans battled, Optimus found Megatron watching the fight and demanded he assist them, but Megatron refused.

<p>Four million years ago, Optimus Prime launched the <a href="/wiki/Ark_(G1)" title="Ark (G1)"><i>Ark</i></a> to clear a path through an asteroid field that threatened Cybertron as his homeworld drifted through space. However, Megatron's forces attacked, boarded their ship, and sent it crashing down onto <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> where both factions fell into <a href="/wiki/Stasis_lock" title="Stasis lock">stasis lock</a>. In the 1980s, the two factions reawoke and began a secret war for the planet's supply of <a href="/wiki/Energon" title="Energon">energon</a> that only ended when the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_III" title="World War III">World War III</a> in the mid-21st century threatened to destroy both Cybertronian factions. With Earth inching ever closer to Cybertron's fate, Optimus led his troops back into space aboard the <a href="/wiki/Titan_(group)" title="Titan (group)">Titan</a> <a href="/wiki/Fortress_Maximus_(G1)" title="Fortress Maximus (G1)">Fortress Maximus</a> so they could scout for new energon deposits; after decades of searching, their vessel detected energon on the remote moon of <a href="/wiki/Cygnus_Seven" title="Cygnus Seven">Cygnus Seven</a>. They were unaware that the Decepticons had pursued them aboard their own Titan, Trypticon; their vessel boarded once again, the two damaged Titans crashed on two separate moons in the system and went dormant, buried underground for many years.
</p><p>Centuries later, the <a href="/wiki/Federation" title="Federation">Federation</a> established a mining outpost on Cygnus Seven, and while examining a <a href="/wiki/Dilithium" title="Dilithium">dilithium</a> mineshaft the surveyors discovered Fortress Maximus and accidentally tripped his autonomous systems. By the time that Fortress Maximus brought Optimus back online, the Decepticons who had boarded the vessel had already attacked the surface, prompting Prime to selflessly rush after them before the ship could resuscitate his fellow Autobots. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime%27s_Directive,_Part_Two" title="Prime's Directive, Part Two">Prime's Directive, Part Two</a></span> When Optimus arrived above ground, he used his <a href="/wiki/Alternate_mode" title="Alternate mode">alternate mode</a> to shield <a href="/wiki/James_T._Kirk" title="James T.

<p>Finding Prime's brain chemistry to be similar to that of the average humanoid, <a href="/wiki/Spock" title="Spock">Spock</a> utilized a <a href="/wiki/Vulcan" title="Vulcan">Vulcan</a> mind meld to successfully rouse him back to functionality. Once Prime had gotten acquainted with the organics, he ferried them back to the mine shaft to meet with Kirk and the other Autobots inside Fortress Maximus, only for the Seekers to bombard the mineshaft and trap their allies underground. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime%27s_Directive,_Part_Two" title="Prime's Directive, Part Two">Prime's Directive, Part Two</a></span> The Decepticons soon revealed themselves to have allied with the <a href="/wiki/Klingon_Empire" title="Klingon Empire">Klingon Empire</a>, and their combined might proved too great for the meager surface force to overcome. As Prime and Spock surrendered themselves to <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)" title="Starscream (G1)">Starscream</a>, Maximus suddenly burst free of the ground, now reformatted into a copy of the <i>Enterprise</i>, and opened fire on <a href="/wiki/Kuri" title="Kuri">Kuri</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Warbird_(Star_Trek)" title="Warbird (Star Trek)">warbird</a>, which revealed itself to be Trypticon. The sight of "Fortress Tiberius" distracted Optimus enough for Megatron to teleport in and blast his foe with his <a href="/wiki/Fusion_cannon" title="Fusion cannon">fusion cannon</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime%27s_Directive,_Part_Three" title="Prime's Directive, Part Three">Prime's Directive, Part Three</a></span>
</p><p>As a result of Starscream sneaking off, Prime regained enough strength to stand against Megatron until Jazz and Windblade arrived to reinforce him; realizing that Starscream had abandoned the fray to conquer <a href="/wiki/Kronos" title="Kronos">Kronos</a>, capital of the <a href="/wiki/Klingon_Empire" title="Klingon Empire">Klingon Empire</a>, the Decepticons made a hasty retreat while the heroes regrouped to pursue their foes, which included beaming Optimus and the other Autobots to the cargo hold of the real <i>Enterprise</i>, so that their knowledge of Cybertronian engineering could speed up the repairs. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime%27s_Directive,_Part_Four" title="Prime's Directive, Part Four">Prime's Directive, Part Four</a></span>
</p><p>Once the <i>Enterprise</i> had been repaired, the two ships warped for <a href="/wiki/Kronos" title="Kronos">Kronos</a>, while Kirk and Optimus discussed their mutual burdens of leadership—but while Kirk adhered to <a href="/wiki/Starfleet" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a>'s "Prime Directive" that forbade interfering with other civilizations, Optimus announced that the crew of the <i>Enterprise</i> would have to respect "Prime's Directive"—refusing to stand idly by while the Decepticons ravaged another unaffiliated civilization. Their conversation inspired Kirk to use the ship's <a href="/wiki/Replicator" title="Replicator">replicators</a> to create the "<a href="/wiki/Crewbot" title="Crewbot">Crewbots</a>"; using this advanced tech, a revitalized Optimus and Kirk spearheaded the combined Autobot-Starfleet force, battling Decepticons until <a href="/wiki/Soundwave_(G1)" title="Soundwave (G1)">Soundwave</a> brought all opposition to their knees with audio disruptor waves. Soundwave failed to take Klingon biology into account, however; deaf to Soundwave's frequency, the aliens deployed a fleet of warbirds that easily overpowered the Decepticons. In the aftermath, both Autobots and humans were allowed to go free. Prime turned down Kirk's offer of refuge on Earth, however, preferring to travel the galaxy aboard Fortress Tiberius, but pledged that he and his team would remain on call if Kirk ever required their assistance. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Prime%27s_Directive,_Part_Five" title="Prime's Directive, Part Five">Prime's Directive, Part Five</a></span>

He fought alongside <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)" title="Ultra Magnus (G1)">Ultra Magnus</a> during a great uprising. They were all mentored by <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Trion_(G1)" title="Alpha Trion (G1)" class="mw-redirect">Alpha Trion</a> before Megatron turned on them and killed Alpha Trion. Optimus was entrusted with the Autobot <a href="/wiki/Matrix" title="Matrix" class="mw-redirect">Matrix</a> of leadership. 
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Wheeljack_(G1)" title="Wheeljack (G1)">Wheeljack</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)" title="Bumblebee (G1)">Bumblebee</a> were about to be executed by the Seekers, when Optimus Prime arrived to protect them. Megatron emerged from the shadows and demanded Optimus accept his treaty, but Optimus declined and the two engaged in battle. Before Megatron could overtake him, a trap laid by <a href="/wiki/Elita_One_(G1)" title="Elita One (G1)">Elita-1</a> gave Optimus and the other Autobots an opening to retreat. At the Autobot base, Ultra Magnus implored Optimus to accept the treaty, but Optimus refused, unable to bear the thought of Cybertron under Megatron's heel. Later, Optimus implored Bumblebee to join the Autobot ranks, only for Bumblebee to decline. Though the others attempted to stop Bumblebee from leaving, Optimus ordered them to let him go. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Siege_episode_1" title="Siege episode 1">Siege episode 1</a></span> 
Optimus revealed to the Autobots that Ultra Magnus had let himself be taken captive by the Decepticons. He promoted Elita-1 to Military Commander. Ultra Magnus sent a message to Autobot base that Megatron is looking for the <a href="/wiki/AllSpark" title="AllSpark">Allspark</a>. Optimus realized the danger if Megatron gets his hands on the Allspark first and organized Autobots into groups to search for it. Elita-1 questioned Optimus' decision to look for the Allspark, believing it to be a long-lost relic. Optimus told her that if Megatron found the Allspark first, the Autobot cause was doomed. The two shared a lovingly look before an alarm goes off. Another report came in from Magnus that gave them the "co-ordinates" of the Allspark. Optimus sent a team of Autobots led by Elita-1 to find it. Elita-1 aired her suspicions that the coordinates were likely a trap, but Optimus pushed on with the mission trusting Magnus' intel. Optimus arrived as the Autobots were being attacked by the Decepticons, who were indeed hidden in an ambush. Optimus fought <a href="/wiki/Impactor_(G1)" title="Impactor (G1)">Impactor</a> and managed to tie him up with his own weapon cable. He fought off <a href="/wiki/Flywheels" title="Flywheels">Flywheels</a> and blasted a Seeker into a tower, which tumbled down on top of Impactor. In the dust that was stirred up, the Autobots retreated, with Optimus transporting off an injured Cog from the battlefield. A dogmatic Optimus told Wheeljack to keep searching for the Allspark, even though the search was draining much of the Autobots reserves. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Siege_episode_2" title="Siege episode 2">Siege episode 2</a></span>
</p><p>Optimus began to hypothesize that the Allspark could be taken off Cybertron. Wheeljack informed Optimus that a Spacebridge could be used to transport the Allspark, and that Ratchet, an old friend of his could fix the rundown Spacebridge. Optimus was part of a group that attacked a Decepticon guard post, while searching for Ratchet. He fought <a href="/wiki/Spinister_(G1)" title="Spinister (G1)">Spinister</a> during the skirmish, ending it by impaling him on a spike. Optimus tried to convince Ratchet to help repair the Spacebridge, but Ratchet wanted nothing to do with it. Optimus was about to walk away when Wheeljack appealed to Ratchet to listen. Optimus told Ratchet of Megatron's planning to weaponize the Allspark, which finally convinced Ratchet to go along with Prime's plan. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Siege_episode_3" title="Siege episode 3">Siege episode 3</a></span>
Optimus detected that the Alpha Trion protocols had been activated, meaning Ultra Magnus had been deactivated. Elita-1 again tried to appeal to Optimus about his plan of taking the Allspark off-world, but Optimus remained fixed on it. He then traveled to the Guardians to inform them of Magnus' demise. While there Optimus informed the Guardians of Megatron's plan with the Allspark and tries to appeal for their help in the war. The Guardians remained steadfast in their neutrality. A dejected Optimus returned to Autobot base, where Bumblebee was brought before him. Optimus realized that the Alpha Trion Protocols had chosen Bumblebee. He explained what these are to Bumblebee. After Bumblebee's vision with Alpha Trion, he assured Optimus of Trion's belief in him, which reassured Optimus. Bumblebee also knew where the Allspark was kept. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Siege_episode_4" title="Siege episode 4">Siege episode 4</a></span> Optimus was part of the group that questions a captive Jetfire. Wheeljack located the Allspark in the <a href="/wiki/Rust_Sea" title="Rust Sea">Sea of Rust</a>. Elita-1 was heavily against the idea of sending a team to retrieve it, but Optimus was again persistent with the Allspark plan. Optimus allowed Jetfire to lead the Autobots through the <a href="/wiki/Rust_Sea" title="Rust Sea">Sea of Rust</a>, once the process of <a href="/wiki/Core_override" title="Core override">core override</a> was applied.

<p>Moonracer was damaged fatally by the Sparkless and fell lifeless in Optimus' arms. Optimus then spotted the Allspark and managed to grab it before any of the others sustained heavy damage. All the Sparkless then disintegrated into a pile of rust. Elita-1 contacted Optimus about the Decepticon attack on the Ark. He sent Prowl and Jetfire to assist in the battle and made his way to the Spacebridge. Optimus was intercepted by Megatron on his way to the Spacebridge. Even Megatron was shocked that Optimus would try to take the Allspark off Cybertron. Jetfire arrived and attacked the Decepticon force, giving Optimus time to escape. Optimus cut down a few Seekers that attacked him with his hand-axe and ordered Ratchet to activate the Spacebridge. As he climbed upwards he was attacked by Megatron. Optimus gained the upper-hand but was blasted by Decepticon forces on the ground and drops the Allspark. Megatron was distracted by Bumblebee, allowing Optimus the chance to again recover the Allspark and throw it into the Spacebridge. Under the cover of attack from Omega Supreme, Optimus ordered all Autobot forces back to the Ark. Elita-1 informed Optimus that she was staying behind on Cybertron. He ordered Ironhide to activate the <i>Ark</i> engines for take-off. The Ark entered the Spacebridge and it appears that it explodes. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Siege_episode_6" title="Siege episode 6">Siege episode 6</a></span>

<p>Optimus ordered Bumblebee to stand-down, after he became conscious and saw that they were surrounded by <a href="/wiki/Doubledealer" title="Doubledealer">Doubledealer</a> and his crew. A captured Optimus was brought before <a href="/wiki/Deseeus" title="Deseeus">Deseeus</a>. Deseeus explained the history of the Cybertronian race and that they need something from Optimus. Deseeus shed it's other four faces leaving it with a singular hostile face. Deseeus ordered Bumblebee to be executed when Wheeljack managed to free the shackles holding the Autobots. Doubledealer and his men also attacked the <a href="/wiki/Quintesson" title="Quintesson">Quintesson</a> and its guards, allowing the Autobots to escape in the chaos.

Optimus was reflecting on his decision to jettison the Allspark from Cybertron when Bumblebee approached him. Bumblebee comforted Optimus and showed his commitment to the Autobot cause by displaying the new red Autobot symbol on his chest. Wheeljack and Ratchet explained to Optimus that the <i>Ark</i> and the Allspark had been separated by a vast distance. There was a Spacebridge that someone had left-on activated in the <a href="/wiki/Nebulos" title="Nebulos">Nebulon</a> that they could use to travel through to get closer. Optimus agreed to the plan and to brace for a possible trap. The <i>Ark</i> arrived at the station to find that half the station is trapped inside the Spacebridge. They boarded the station searching for signs of life. Wheeljack hatched a plan to break the station apart so that the Ark could then fit through the Spacebridge. Optimus and Bumblebee had to go through the portal to set their charges at the other end of the station. Through the portal they found that they were above a beautiful, lush planet, bereft of any lifeforms. Optimus then received Wheeljack's distress call. They set the charges and rushed to his aid. Optimus rolled in and automatically attacked <a href="/wiki/Scorponok_(G1)" title="Scorponok (G1)">Scorponok</a>. He managed to deflect attacks from Scorponok's tail and ordered the Autobots to retreat back to the <i>Ark</i>. Optimus attacked Scorponok with his axe, forcing his opponent to push back, and then eventually falling off the walkway behind him. Scorponok then transformed and reappeared in robot-mode, forcing the Autobots to flee him. They made it to a hall-way and sealed the door behind them, separating them from Scorponok. However, they were then trapped. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Earthrise_episode_3" title="Earthrise episode 3">Earthrise episode 3</a></span>
</p><p>Scorponok broke through the door, forcing the Autobots to attack him again. Optimus tried to fight Scorponok by himself but was grabbed and picked up by the Titan. He was saved by an unlikely ally in Megatron, who blasted Scorponok's hand, forcing him to drop Optimus. The Decepticons also begun to attack Scorponok. Optimus grabbed one of the explosive charges with the intent of using it on Scorponok when he was attacked by Megatron. Megatron easily defeated Optimus and planned to destroy him with his fusion cannon when Scorponok attacks both of the leaders. Optimus threw his charge at Scorponok and shot it with a laser-blast, detonating it. The explosion knocked everyone to the ground. Optimus gained consciousness in a cut-off area with only him and Megatron, who was pinned by a metal-girder through him. Optimus admitted that he should not have ejected the Allspark off-world. Megatron informed Optimus on how he arrived at the station, and the means that it took to get there through Project <a href="/wiki/Nemesis_(G1)" title="Nemesis (G1)"><i>Nemesis</i></a>. Optimus was horrified and asked about Elita-1. Megatron replied that she is most probably dead. Optimus could not bring himself to let Megatron die and decided to take Megatron with him. Megatron scoffed at the idea and told Optimus that without Megatron, the Autobots cause would most likely become victorious. Optimus retorted that without Optimus, Megatron would not have had a target to unite the Decepticons. The two leaders agreed to work together to bring back the Allspark to Cybertron. Optimus then pulled out the girder out of Megatron. Megatron, who was supported by Optimus, orders his forces to cease fire after they were engaged in battle with the Autobots. After Soundwave opened the hatch doors, Optimus the Autobots to escape, but is cut off by an attacking Scorponok. He caught a falling Megatron and then ordered his troops to attack Scorponok. Optimus asked a hesitant Wheeljack to repair Megatron. Optimus then jumped onto Scorponok holding a cable. He then wrapped it around his head and started riding him. Optimus was about to be stung by Scorponok's tail when Megatron blasted Scorponok, forcing him to retreat. Megatron then decided that the truce was over and condemned the Autobots to death. Optimus compared Megatron to the Quintessons, which caused an inquiring Scorponok to come back and attack the Decepticons. The Autobots managed to escape in all the chaos. Optimus ordered the <i>Ark</i> to leave the station. Before that could happen, the <i>Nemesis</i> attacked the station causing the <i>Ark</i> to be transported somewhere else. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Earthrise_episode_4" title="Earthrise episode 4">Earthrise episode 4</a></span>

<p>Orion Pax was forged at some point before the end of the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Threefold_Spark" title="War of the Threefold Spark">War of the Threefold Spark</a>, and was apprenticed to the archivist <a href="/wiki/Codexa" title="Codexa">Codexa</a>. Following the end of the war, he was one of the many Cybertronians who helped rebuild <a href="/wiki/Iacon_(polity)" title="Iacon (polity)">Iacon</a>. During this period, he befriended another young Cybertronian, Megatron, and the two eventually became good friends. However, Megatron soon fell in with the ambitious <a href="/wiki/Termagax" title="Termagax">Termagax</a>, who sought to revitalize a postwar Cybertron that she felt was growing increasingly stagnant.
</p><p>On the eve of the opening of the <a href="/wiki/Winged_Moon" title="Winged Moon">Winged Moon</a>, Codexa, who was nearing retirement, sent Orion to visit the <a href="/wiki/Tether" title="Tether">Tether</a> in Iacon, where the archivist met up with Megatron, who had helped build the moon along with his fellow miners. Orion explained to Megatron that he planned to take a leave of absence from his job and tour Cybertron's various colony worlds. However, Megatron deliberately stopped the elevator midway up the shaft, so as to show Orion everything that Termagax had taught him: that <i>true</i> equilibrium was but a myth, and that the only way true stability could be ensured was through constant change. The pair plummeted towards Cybertron a suborbital trajectory, and after splashing down in the <a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=Lechate_Lagoons&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lechate Lagoons (page does not exist)">Lechate Lagoons</a>, Orion grumbled about Megatron's erratic behaviour. Megatron, outraged that Orion had not been able to see what he had been trying to show him, snapped at him that he could do what he liked and tour the colonies, while Megatron would do what <i>he</i> did best and work to change Cybertron for the better. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Orion_Pax:_Free_Fall" title="Orion Pax: Free Fall">Orion Pax: Free Fall</a></span> After returning from his voyage, Orion spoke to Codexa who still planned to go <a href="/wiki/Immersant" title="Immersant">immersant</a>. Though both could see that Orion no longer intended to become Chief Archivist, Codexa assured her mentee that she was proud of him. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/End_of_Time" title="End of Time">End of Time</a></span> Orion was one of the many in the intra-war era to mistake <a href="/wiki/Cliffjumper_(G1)" title="Cliffjumper (G1)">Cliffjumper</a> for <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)" title="Bumblebee (G1)">Bumblebee</a> as he commended Cliffjumper's sanitation work. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Wannabee,_Part_1" title="Wannabee, Part 1">Wannabee, Part 1</a></span>

<p>Three hundred kilocycles later, Orion Pax had left his job as an archivist behind and worked to become a senator in the Cybertronian <a href="/wiki/Senate" title="Senate">Senate</a>, a representative of the <a href="/wiki/Autobot" title="Autobot">Autobots</a> under incumbent ruler <a href="/wiki/Sentinel_Prime_(G1)" title="Sentinel Prime (G1)">Sentinel Prime</a>. As a Senator, Orion would help out <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)" title="Bumblebee (G1)">Bumblebee</a> at some point, to the point where the yellow 'bot owed him a favor. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Cracks_Beneath_Your_Feet_Part_Five" title="The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Five">The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Five</a></span> However, as the years went by, an increasingly dissatisfied group of Cybertronians arose, who called themselves the <a href="/wiki/Decepticon" title="Decepticon">Ascenticons</a>... a faction led by none other than Megatron. Before long, a violent splinter group known as <a href="/wiki/The_Rise" title="The Rise">The Rise</a> manifested, which sought to make themselves known through violence and vandalism, while Megatron's Ascenticon rallies grew increasingly controversial.

<p>When Sentinel Prime left Cybertron to embark on a tour of Cybertron's colony worlds, Orion was left in charge of the Senate while he was away. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_World_In_Your_Eyes_Part_One" title="The World In Your Eyes Part One">The World In Your Eyes Part One</a></span> When a new Cybertronian was to be forged, Pax nominated Bumblebee to serve as their <a href="/wiki/Mentor" title="Mentor">mentor</a>. At the unveiling ceremony of the newborn, Pax provided Bumblebee with some words of encouragement, <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Lord_of_Misrule:_Swindle%27s_II" title="Lord of Misrule: Swindle's II">Swindle's II</a></span> before he welcomed <a href="/wiki/Rubble" title="Rubble">Rubble</a> into the world. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_World_In_Your_Eyes_Part_Four" title="The World In Your Eyes Part Four">The World In Your Eyes Part Four</a></span> Roughly forty cycles later, Orion met with his old former friend Megatron to discuss the nature of Megatron's increasingly volatile movement and the costs that his speeches were incurring; however, he was unable to dissuade Megatron from holding his latest rally in <a href="/wiki/Tarn_(polity)" title="Tarn (polity)">Tarn</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_World_In_Your_Eyes_Part_One" title="The World In Your Eyes Part One">The World In Your Eyes Part One</a></span> Shortly afterwards, Orion was forced to intervene when <a href="/wiki/Chromia_(G1)" title="Chromia (G1)">Chromia</a> reported that the energon specialist <a href="/wiki/Brainstorm_(G1)" title="Brainstorm (G1)">Brainstorm</a> had been murdered by an unknown assailant; however, Orion ordered her to send more ground forces to Megatron's rally in Tarn in case things got ugly. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_World_In_Your_Eyes_Part_Two" title="The World In Your Eyes Part Two">The World In Your Eyes Part Two</a></span>
</p><p>The next morning, Orion and his inner retinue of 'bots watched with consternation as Megatron announced the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Ascenticon_Guard" title="Ascenticon Guard">Ascenticon Guard</a>, a private organization designed to keep security at Megatron's Ascenticon rallies. While on the way to the Senate, Orion met with <a href="/wiki/Froid" title="Froid">Froid</a>, who warned him that the Ascenticon Guard recruit <a href="/wiki/Quake_(G1)" title="Quake (G1)">Quake</a> was a sociopath with a violence addiction— although Orion was only able to get Froid on his way after promising to investigate the matter. Despite being the nominal leader of Cybertron until Sentinel Prime returned, however, Orion and the 'bots of <a href="/wiki/Security_Operations" title="Security Operations">Security Operations</a> were unable to deduce Brainstorm's killer. Realizing the best way to keep tabs on Megatron's organization, Orion sought out Codexa for guidance, <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_World_In_Your_Eyes_Part_Three" title="The World In Your Eyes Part Three">The World In Your Eyes Part Three</a></span> and after reminiscing about his long relationship with Megatron, the somnolent Cybertronian agreed that he would have to do what was necessary in order to keep the increasingly fragile peace on the planet. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Orion_Pax:_Free_Fall" title="Orion Pax: Free Fall">Orion Pax: Free Fall</a></span>
</p>
<div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><a href="/wiki/File:TheWorldInYourEyesPart4-OrionPax.jpg" class="image"><img alt="TheWorldInYourEyesPart4-OrionPax.jpg" src="/mediawiki/images2/thumb/a/af/TheWorldInYourEyesPart4-OrionPax.jpg/200px-TheWorldInYourEyesPart4-OrionPax.jpg" width="200" height="318" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:TheWorldInYourEyesPart4-OrionPax.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/mediawiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div></div></div></div>
<p>At some point after this, Orion met with Bumblebee, and asked him to join the Ascenticon Guard as an undercover mole that would keep tabs on activity within the organization. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_World_In_Your_Eyes_Part_Three" title="The World In Your Eyes Part Three">The World In Your Eyes Part Three</a></span> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Cracks_Beneath_Your_Feet_Part_Five" title="The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Five">The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Five</a></span> In between these illicit dealings, he continued to serve as Cybertron's <i>de facto</i> leader; in this role, he welcomed <a href="/wiki/Gauge" title="Gauge">Gauge</a> into the world at the <a href="/wiki/Forge_Pyramid" title="Forge Pyramid">Pyramid</a> at a forging ceremony and was responsible for organizing Brainstorm's funeral, though the Autobot senator despaired at the fact that he was forced to compromise with the fanatically fervent <a href="/wiki/Reversionist" title="Reversionist">Reversionists</a> to keep the peace, and thus was obligated to hire a fundamentalist 'bot to oversee the funeral of the notoriously atheistic Brainstorm. At the funeral, Orion once again requested that Megatron tone down his ever-more inflammatory rhetoric, pointing out that Termagax would likely disapprove of his behaviour, though Megatron once more declined to do so. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_World_In_Your_Eyes_Part_Four" title="The World In Your Eyes Part Four">The World In Your Eyes Part Four</a></span>
</p><p>Following the death of Bumblebee's young mentee <a href="/wiki/Rubble" title="Rubble">Rubble</a>, Orion arrived to offer his condolences to his friend, but Bumblebee wasn't interested in his words and stormed off. A subsequent call from <a href="/wiki/Ironhide_(G1)" title="Ironhide (G1)">Ironhide</a> informed him that Sentinel Prime had finally learned of the two murders, and was cutting his trip short to return to Cybertron. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Cracks_Beneath_Your_Feet_Part_One" title="The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part One">The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part One</a></span> At a subsequent emergency meeting of the Senate, Orion's calls for the Senate to denounce The Rise as one were denied by Megatron, who snarled that, despite Orion's various condemnations of the increasingly violent Ascenticons, the Autobots couldn't simply <i>force</i> people to agree on things. Again ignoring Orion's request for Megatron to disband the Ascenticon Guard and denounce The Rise, Megatron stalked from the room. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Cracks_Beneath_Your_Feet_Part_Four" title="The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Four">The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Four</a></span>
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><a href="/wiki/File:TheCracksBeneathYourFeetPartFive-donotgoback.jpg" class="image"><img alt="TheCracksBeneathYourFeetPartFive-donotgoback.jpg" src="/mediawiki/images2/thumb/d/d4/TheCracksBeneathYourFeetPartFive-donotgoback.jpg/250px-TheCracksBeneathYourFeetPartFive-donotgoback.jpg" width="250" height="299" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:TheCracksBeneathYourFeetPartFive-donotgoback.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/mediawiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div></div></div></div>
<p>Following Sentinel Prime's return to Cybertron, Orion filled in the Autobot leader on everything that had gone down since his absence, including a recent police standoff outside of <a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=Ascenticon_headquarters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ascenticon headquarters (page does not exist)">Ascenticon headquarters</a>. Countering Sentinel's notion to simply use overwhelming force, Orion promised that he'd be able to peacefully de-escalate the situation instead. In the meantime, Orion received a data-jack from Chromia, which revealed the identities of forty Ascenticons affiliated with The Rise. Later that day, Orion met with Bumblebee, warning him that the situation within the Ascenticons had grown to dangerous levels and instructing him to get out while he still could. To his surprise, Bumblebee refused: Rubble died because of him, and Bumblebee now saw the Ascenticon Guard as a way to put things right on the planet. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Cracks_Beneath_Your_Feet_Part_Five" title="The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Five">The Cracks Beneath Your Feet Part Five</a></span>
</p><p>Sentinel continued to contradict Orion's better judgment. Orion had hoped to bring the Autobots and Ascenticons together for a joint statement denouncing the Rise. Instead, Sentinel Prime publicly painted the Rise and the Ascenticons with the same brush, lumping them together to the exclusion of many public sympathies. A stand-off between the Rise and Security Operations at an immersant Titan led to the decapitation of that near-holy figure in an explosion. Although the public statement was that the Rise committed suicide, Bumblebee secretly reported to Orion and Chromia that Senator Soundwave killed them to cover up the Rise's activities. Sentinel's responses only got worse from there. He authorized extreme actions towards the capture of most wanted Rise members, and was prepared to arrest and interrogate Senator Soundwave for his actions. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Change_In_Your_Nature_Part_Three" title="The Change In Your Nature Part Three">The Change In Your Nature Part Three</a></span> Orion was unable to dissuade Sentinel Prime from a plot to lure the Ascenticons to the Senate under false pretenses and arrest Soundwave within the senate precincts. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Change_In_Your_Nature_Part_Four" title="The Change In Your Nature Part Four">The Change In Your Nature Part Four</a></span>
</p><p>When the Ascenticons failed to take the bait and the Rise severed the Tether, causing massive damage to the planet, Sentinel was livid. He planned to cut energon rations even further and possibly storm the Ascenticon building to drag Soundwave out into the street. Orion continued to counsel reason and moderation, trying to remind Sentinel Prime that millions still supported the Ascenticons. Sentinel openly rejected Orion Pax's counsel on all points, and went so far as to say Orion would never lead the Autobots, even after he was gone. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Rise_of_the_Decepticons:_All_Fall_Down" title="Rise of the Decepticons: All Fall Down">All Fall Down</a></span> Orion later visited <a href="/wiki/Polyhex" title="Polyhex">Polyhex</a>, where the <a href="/wiki/Titan_(group)" title="Titan (group)">Titan</a> <a href="/wiki/Lodestar_(Titan)" title="Lodestar (Titan)">Lodestar</a> was being repaired, ordering the <a href="/wiki/Cityspeaker" title="Cityspeaker">cityspeaker</a> <a href="/wiki/Lightbright_(G1)" title="Lightbright (G1)">Lightbright</a> to take the Titan to the <a href="/wiki/Black_Hub" title="Black Hub">Black Hub</a> for a weaponized refit. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Rise_of_the_Decepticons:_Swindle%27s" title="Rise of the Decepticons: Swindle's">Swindle's</a></span>

<p>When Megatron later broadcasted another message, Orion informed Chromia of Sentinel's plan to denounce the Ascenticons while warning that, unlike the Autobots, Megatron had a clear endgame planned. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Rise_of_the_Decepticons:_Tremors" title="Rise of the Decepticons: Tremors">Tremors</a></span> Soon afterwards, Quake was captured with Orion unable to dissuade Sentinel from turning the arrest into a public spectacle, simply ordering <a href="/wiki/Nautica_(G1)" title="Nautica (G1)">Nautica</a> to find the missing <a href="/wiki/Voin" title="Voin">Voin</a> Asserter and contain it. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Rise_of_the_Decepticons:_Prisoners" title="Rise of the Decepticons: Prisoners">Prisoners</a></span> As Sentinel's secret Senate meeting commenced, the Ascenticons marched towards the building. With no legal recourse, Orion let them pass, after one last failed attempt at deterring Megatron's demagoguery, and ordered security beefed up. Entering the Senate chambers, Orion bore witness to Megatron renaming his movement as the "Decepticons" and declaring himself ruler of Cybertron. Before Orion could do more than order the doors sealed, the ceiling collapsed, with <a href="/wiki/Ion_Storm" title="Ion Storm">Ion Storm</a> rendering all Senators unconscious. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Rise_of_the_Decepticons:_We_Have_Deceived_You" title="Rise of the Decepticons: We Have Deceived You">We Have Deceived You</a></span>
</p><p>Locked in a cell, Orion attempted to speak to Megatron once more only for the <a href="/wiki/Decepticon_leader" title="Decepticon leader">Decepticon leader</a> to bluntly say he had no respect for Orion following his planting Bumblebee as a spy. When Ironhide's group broke the Senators out, Sentinel Prime flew off ahead, forcing Orion and Chromia to follow from the ground. Catching up with the Prime at <a href="/wiki/The_Slaarg_%26_Turbofox" title="The Slaarg &amp; Turbofox">The Slaarg &amp; Turbofox</a>, Orion found the First Senator had been fatally wounded by the <a href="/wiki/Rainmaker" title="Rainmaker">Rainmakers</a>. In his last moments, Sentinel ordered Orion to warn <a href="/wiki/Perceptor_(G1)" title="Perceptor (G1)">Perceptor</a>, kill <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)" title="Starscream (G1)">Starscream</a> and bring the Matrix of Leadership to Ultra Magnus before his spark faded. When the talisman ejected itself from Sentinel's chest, Orion seized it only for the Matrix to unexpectedly activate and bond itself to him.
</p><p>His consciousness brought within the Matrix, Orion was greeted by its <a href="/wiki/Mediator" title="Mediator">Mediator</a> program, in the guise of <a href="/wiki/Codexa" title="Codexa">Codexa</a>, who informed him of the Matrix's history while warning that the coming conflict would be fought to save civilization. Making his choice, Orion accepted the burden and was rebranded by the Matrix as Optimus Prime. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/War_World:_Prime" title="War World: Prime">Prime</a></span>
</p><p>With Ultra Magnus still missing and <a href="/wiki/Strika_(BM)" title="Strika (BM)">Strika</a> having joined the Decepticons, Optimus' first act was to order the release of the <a href="/wiki/Great_General" title="Great General">Great General</a> <a href="/wiki/Pyra_Magna" title="Pyra Magna">Pyra Magna</a> for her counsel. Addressing his troops, noting that none of them sought war but that they would stand to defend the innocent from tyranny. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/War_World:_Awakenings" title="War World: Awakenings">Awakenings</a></span> Optimus was soon approached by <a href="/wiki/Hound_(G1)" title="Hound (G1)">Hound</a> and Nautica who brought news of <a href="/wiki/Insecticon_(G1)" title="Insecticon (G1)">Insecticons</a> attacking the <a href="/wiki/Xeno-Quarter" title="Xeno-Quarter">Xeno-Quarter</a>. Recognizing that the Decepticons would turn their attention to the <a href="/wiki/Alien" title="Alien">aliens</a>, Optimus authorized Hound and Nautica to coordinate an evacuation, granting them any resources that they might require. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Escape_Part_One" title="Escape Part One">Escape Part One</a></span>

<p>When the Decepticons had conquered three-quarters of Iacon, Optimus received a tip to ask Perceptor about <a href="/wiki/Titan_(group)" title="Titan (group)">Titan</a> <a href="/wiki/Spark" title="Spark">sparks</a>, learning that <a href="/wiki/Nominus_Prime" title="Nominus Prime">Nominus Prime</a> had instituted a policy, one continued by Sentinel, to divert any Titan sparks into a storage vault. When Perceptor revealed his belief that Starscream had gotten his job due to somehow knowing of this, Optimus realized that the Seeker had sold out the Titan to Megatron. When an invasion force arrived, the firepower unleashed caused irreparable damage to the Pyramid. Optimus smashed <a href="/wiki/Nova_Storm_(G1)" title="Nova Storm (G1)">Nova Storm</a> out of the building and told her to warn her comrades that the whole place was about to collapse. After ordering an evacuation, Optimus watched the structure perish, telling Perceptor that they would discuss his role in storing the Titan sparks later. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/War_World:_Titans" title="War World: Titans">Titans</a></span>
</p><p>In a meeting with Pyra Magna, Optimus was convinced to engage in holographic discussions with Megatron while he led the Autobots to evacuate Iacon. Though making an attempt to have Megatron peacefully stand down once again, negotiations broke down and Optimus led the Autobots through the <a href="/wiki/Cybertronian_Mountains" title="Cybertronian Mountains">Cybertronian Mountains</a> to safety, casting a mournful last look at Iacon. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/War_World:_We_Are_Not_Meant_To_Be_Darkness" title="War World: We Are Not Meant To Be Darkness">We Are Not Meant To Be Darkness</a></span>

<p>Overseeing the <a href="/wiki/Rite_of_the_Autobrand" title="Rite of the Autobrand">Rite of the Autobrand</a>, Optimus told his troops of their responsibility to redeem the Autobot symbol and name before he charged Pyra Magna to seek out Termagax based on Bumblebee's warning. When <a href="/wiki/Highbrow_(G1)" title="Highbrow (G1)">Highbrow</a> casually piped up that he knew where Termagax was, Optimus instead dispatched aerial forces to locate her. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Lord_of_Misrule:_Sea_of_Rust_I" title="Lord of Misrule: Sea of Rust I">Sea of Rust I</a></span> Pyra Magna went on ahead and secured the site, already under assault by Insecticon clones. Optimus Prime followed with Ironhide and the Senate Guard (now calling themselves the Prime Guard) and as many forces as he could spare. Rightly suspecting that the Decepticons sought the Enigma of Combination, Optimus confronted Termagax about it within her <a href="/wiki/House_(building)" title="House (building)">House</a> only for the Ascenticon founder to refuse to surrender it. She remained similarly obstinate when Optimus tried to have her join the Autobots, the Prime arguing that she was too prominent a figure to declare political neutrality. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Lord_of_Misrule:_Sea_of_Rust_II" title="Lord of Misrule: Sea of Rust II">Sea of Rust II</a></span> As the battle raged outside, Pyra Magna encouraged Prime and Termagax to wrap up their little debate. Instead, it was the sudden return of <a href="/wiki/Skywarp_(G1)" title="Skywarp (G1)">Skywarp</a> that made their arguing moot.

</p><p>With Ultra Magnus, Optimus then went to visit Codexa, asking about the rumours that Exarchon had returned who informed him that the ancient warlord had usurped <a href="/wiki/Ruckus_(G1)" title="Ruckus (G1)">Ruckus</a>. As the two left, they discovered a group of Decepticons holding their escort hostage.

<p>After Magnus had been rescued, Optimus sent Crystal City's non-combatants to <a href="/wiki/Darkmount_(Cybertron)" title="Darkmount (Cybertron)">Darkmount</a> while the Autobots would attempt to hold the line until <a href="/wiki/Lodestar_(Titan)" title="Lodestar (Titan)">Lodestar</a> returned. When the Decepticons began shelling Crystal City, Optimus spoke with Bumblebee about their duty to fight with the Decepticons weighed against the consequences of war before Bumblebee went off to join the fight. After the Decepticons had broken through the Autobot lines, Optimus stood ready to fight just before Lodestar arrived. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/A_Dust_of_Crystals" title="A Dust of Crystals">A Dust of Crystals</a></span>
</p><p>The sheer size of the Titan proved enough to scare away most of the invading army, allowing her to deploy <a href="/wiki/Computron_(G1)" title="Computron (G1)">Computron</a> to fend off <a href="/wiki/Strika%27s_Heavies" title="Strika's Heavies">Strika's Heavies</a> long enough for Optimus to emerge from the Autobot bunker. After allowing Pyra to respond to a distress call from the Sonic Canyons and sending Lodestar off to Darkmount, Optimus called for a temporary ceasefire. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Landscape_of_Fear" title="The Landscape of Fear">The Landscape of Fear</a></span> Speaking with Megatron, Optimus managed to secure a temporary ceasefire until Exarchon, the <a href="/wiki/Rust_worm" title="Rust worm">rust worms</a> and Insecticlones were defeated, whereupon Optimus promised to surrender Cybertron to Megatron. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/War%27s_End_Part_One" title="War's End Part One">War's End Part One</a></span>
</p><p>With Crystal City in ruins, Optimus led the Autobots on a march to Darkmount, seeking to make the most of the limited time they had before Megatron inevitably violated the truce. As the Autobots marched, they were beset by shelling from <a href="/wiki/Jhiaxus_(G2)" title="Jhiaxus (G2)">Jhiaxus</a>' forces, the Decepticon lieutenant answering that they were corralling the Insecticons. Before Optimus could rally his troops, the Matrix called to him, bringing him into it. The Mediator spoke to Optimus again, warning him that Cybertron was preparing to die and the fear of death was spreading to all Cybertronians. When the time came, the Mediator warned, Optimus' optimism would be needed to unite the species. Reactivating, Optimus found the situation had only gotten worse. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Radical_Time" title="Radical Time">Radical Time</a></span>

<p>With the rust worms closing in, Optimus led his troops into battle against them, fighting a delaying action. Just as the Autobots were about to overwhelmed, Termagax's gambit succeeded and the Insecticlones began consuming the rust worms. Continuing on to Darkmount, the Autobots were barred by Skywarp who was armed with an <a href="/wiki/Imploder" title="Imploder">imploder</a>, one he threatened to detonate if the Autobots didn't wait for Megatron. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/End_of_Time" title="End of Time">End of Time</a></span>
</p><p>When Megatron arrived, Optimus pleaded to be let past, promising to honor his word and give the planet to Megatron. Aware that Optimus intended to continue resisting him even in space, the tyrant refused, instead demanding the Matrix of Leadership. When Optimus refused to surrender the talisman, the two leaders came to blows, all of their forces held at bay by Skywarp's imploder. When Computron arrived and <a href="/wiki/Jumpstream" title="Jumpstream">Jumpstream</a> teleported Skywarp away, Megatron permitted the Autobots to continue on their march.
</p><p>Upon arriving, the science teams informed Optimus that the fourth <i>Ark</i> and Lodestar were sufficiently repaired, if only just. When the Decepticon army arrived, they quickly overwhelmed Darkmount's meager defences, the savage might of <a href="/wiki/Devastator_(G1)" title="Devastator (G1)">Devastator</a> overpowering Computron and <a href="/wiki/Leviathan_(G1)" title="Leviathan (G1)">Leviathan</a>.

<p>Having gathered his Autobots and fled Cybertron aboard the starship <i><a href="/wiki/Ark_(G1)" title="Ark (G1)">Ark</a></i>, Optimus Prime and the Autobots were among the few Cybertronians who escaped the extinction of their species at the hands of the monstrous <a href="/wiki/Gozer" title="Gozer">Gozer</a>, <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Ghosts_of_Cybertron_Part_1" title="Ghosts of Cybertron Part 1">Ghosts of Cybertron Part 1</a></span> taking the life-giving <a href="/wiki/AllSpark" title="AllSpark">AllSpark</a> with them. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Ghosts_of_Cybertron_Part_4" title="Ghosts of Cybertron Part 4">Ghosts of Cybertron Part 4</a></span> After a thousand lonely years of aimlessly wandering the cosmos, the young scientist <a href="/wiki/Ectotron" title="Ectotron">Ectronymous Diamatron</a> detected an anomalous Cybertronian signal from a <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">nearby planet</a>; though the other Autobots remained sceptical, Prime granted Ectronymous the opportunity to travel to Earth to investigate. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Ghosts_of_Cybertron_Part_1" title="Ghosts of Cybertron Part 1">Ghosts of Cybertron Part 1</a></span>
</p><p>After coming into contact with both <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)" title="Starscream (G1)">Starscream</a>'s ghost, and a group of <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a> paranormal investigators who called themselves the "<a href="/wiki/Ghostbusters" title="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a>", Ectronymous – mercifully having adopted the nickname of "Ectotron" – made contact with Prime, and, overriding the concerns of his fellow Autobots, travelled to Earth alone to investigate Ectotron's fantastical story; landing in <a href="/wiki/Westchester_County" title="Westchester County">Westchester County</a> and adopting a suitable Earth disguise, Prime made his way to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, and parked outside of the <a href="/wiki/Ghostbusters_firehouse" title="Ghostbusters firehouse">firehouse headquarters</a> to recharge while the Ghostbusters were out.

<p>By morning, the Autobots had relocated to the Ghostbusters' offsite warehouse in <a href="/wiki/Red_Hook" title="Red Hook">Red Hook</a> while the Ghostbusters tracked Starscream's PKE signature; in the meantime, Optimus engaged his <a href="/wiki/Nanochromatic_camouflage" title="Nanochromatic camouflage">nanochromatic camouflage</a> to adopt a new livery inspired by the Ghostbusters' own <a href="/wiki/Ecto-1" title="Ecto-1">Ecto-1</a> vehicle, and accepted a massively upscaled <a href="/wiki/Proton_pack" title="Proton pack">proton pack</a> from <a href="/wiki/Egon_Spengler" title="Egon Spengler">Egon Spengler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ray_Stantz" title="Ray Stantz">Ray Stantz</a>.

There, Prime discovered that Starscream had indeed survived Cybertron's destruction—thanks to <a href="/wiki/Kremzeek" title="Kremzeek">Kremzeek</a> the Scavenger, a supernatural being that had transformed several Decepticons into ghosts in the hopes that he could one day absorb the AllSpark and claim its power for his own. 
</p><p>The electrically charged phantasm was able to burst free of their energy bonds, Kremzeek was weakened enough for Prime to take him on in hand-to-hand combat; despite Kremzeek leeching electricity from the local power grid to regain his strength, Prime was able to keep him occupied while the other Ghostbusters rigged up a backup plan: releasing <a href="/wiki/Killerwatt" title="Killerwatt">an electricity-eating ghost</a> that they had captured the previous night, who promptly devoured Kremzeek. In the aftermath, however, Kremzeek's destruciton <i>also</i> released the ghostly forms of Megatron and his inner retinue of Decepticons; when his attempts to talk the Decepticon leader down went unheeded, Prime promptly plugged his proton accelerator directly into his systems, producing a proton-charged <a href="/wiki/Energon-axe" title="Energon-axe">energon-axe</a> to take on his old foes. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Ghosts_of_Cybertron_Part_4" title="Ghosts of Cybertron Part 4">Ghosts of Cybertron Part 4</a></span>
</p><p>Facing off against Megatron, Optimus was able to keep his spectral foe at bay with his proton-powered weaponry, but was unprepared when Megatron used his ghostly powers to possess Ectotron, knowing that Optimus Prime would be unwilling to harm a fellow Autobot. Briefly overpowered by the possessed Ectotron, Prime and the Ghostbusters were nevertheless able to expel Megatron from his host by using some <a href="/wiki/Mood_slime" title="Mood slime">mood slime</a> to forcibly eject Megatron's ghost. Following Ectotron's capture of Megatron in a <a href="/wiki/Ghost_trap" title="Ghost trap">ghost trap</a>, Optimus collected the various defeated ghost traps, bringing them back to the <i>Ark</i> in the hopes of rehabilitating them before using the AllSpark to restore their bodies, while authorizing Ectotron to continue his journey across the cosmos to keep an eye out for any other Cybertronian ghosts. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Ghosts_of_Cybertron_Part_5" title="Ghosts of Cybertron Part 5">Ghosts of Cybertron Part 5</a></span>

<p>While battling for control of a malfunctioning <a href="/wiki/Space_bridge" title="Space bridge">spacebridge</a>, Optimus Prime was among the many Cybertronians <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magically</a> transported to <a href="/wiki/Equestria" title="Equestria">Equestria</a> by <a href="/wiki/Queen_Chrysalis" title="Queen Chrysalis">Queen Chrysalis</a>. As he and Bumblebee fell victim to the planet's gravity field, they were saved by <a href="/wiki/Twilight_Sparkle" title="Twilight Sparkle">Twilight Sparkle</a>. Though the royal equine was pleased to learn that the Autobots were the friendly and rational sort, Optimus warned her that not all Cybertronians were so altruistic. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformation_Is_Magic" title="Transformation Is Magic">Transformation Is Magic</a></span>
</p><p>Aware that the Decepticons would regroup and launch an attack on the ponies, Optimus traveled Equestria with Twilight Sparkle to rally the Autobots, arriving in time to lead the defense of the <a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=Crystal_Empire&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Crystal Empire (page does not exist)">Crystal Empire</a> against the Decepticon/<a href="/wiki/Changeling" title="Changeling">changeling</a> alliance. As the battle raged, a spacebridge opened through which Grimlock and Twilight's assistant <a href="/wiki/Spike_(MLP)" title="Spike (MLP)">Spike</a> came through. Realizing that changeling magic was not required to return to Cybertron, Optimus combined the power of the Matrix of Leadership with Twilight's magic of friendship, returning the Decepticons to Cybertron. After a delightful tea and energon party, the Autobots returned home, Optimus destroying the spacebridge to protect Equestria from further Decepticon incursions. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Finale_(Friendship_in_Disguise!)" title="Finale (Friendship in Disguise!)">Finale</a></span>
</p><p>When a mass of blackness erupted from Decepticon territory, Optimus led his troops to the site to discover that the Decepticons had sought to plunder Equestrian magic for their own ends and unwittingly helped free the <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" title="Unicorn">unicorn</a> tyrant <a href="/wiki/King_Sombra" title="King Sombra">King Sombra</a>. When Optimus interrogated Shockwave on what the Decepticons had done, the ponies informed him of the danger before saying that the threat would require an Autobot/Decepticon alliance. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/The_Magic_of_Cybertron" title="The Magic of Cybertron">The Magic of Cybertron</a></span>
</p><p>When it was discovered the Sombra sought to unleash <a href="/wiki/Scorponok_(G1)" title="Scorponok (G1)">Scorponok</a>, Optimus led the alliance into battle, facing off against the enthralled Megatron before Starscream freed his master from the unicorn's control.

In the aftermath, Optimus offered an olive branch to Megatron to end the war, an offer that was agreed to, before he oversaw the <a href="/wiki/Wonderbolt" title="Wonderbolt" class="mw-redirect">Wonderbolts</a> escorting the bound Sombra back to Equestria. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Finale_(The_Magic_of_Cybertron)" title="Finale (The Magic of Cybertron)">Finale</a></span>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Calm_Sleep_Stories">Calm Sleep Stories</span></h3>
<p>During Cybertron's <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age" title="Golden Age">Golden Age</a>, a young Optimus Prime worked as a data clerk at the Hall of Records. His living quarters were in a residential complex near the <a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=Benevolous_Bridge&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Benevolous Bridge (page does not exist)">Benevolous Bridge</a>, which led to the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Preserve" title="Alpha Preserve">Alpha Preserve</a> public park where he liked to relax. When <a href="/wiki/Jetfire_(G1)" title="Jetfire (G1)">Jetfire</a> came to the Hall of Records seeking data on the bridge's construction, planning to dismantle it before it collapsed, Optimus instead suggested they repair and reinforce the bridge to ensure bots could still use it to reach the Alpha Preserve. Jetfire agreed, and the two worked together to replace the weakened portions with more sturdy heat-treated metal. After a week, their work was finished, earning the admiration of the nearby complex's residents, and Optimus and Jetfire became close friends after the experience.
</p><p>After Megatron's revolution began, Optimus became the leader of the Autobots, leading the advance against the Decepticons. During the war, Optimus learned of a battle near the Benevolous Bridge, which had a large hole in it by the time he arrived. When Jetfire approached him, now a member of the Decepticons, Optimus pleaded with his old friend to help him repair the bridge so no one on either side might get hurt when crossing. Though Jetfire said nothing, he assisted Optimus in patching the walkway with metal from a nearby toolshed. Their work finished, Optimus promised he would always consider Jetfire a friend regardless of their differences. Though Optimus would eventually lose track of Jetfire over the following years, he would often think of his friend and of his memories of the Alpha Preserve's tranquility. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Building_Bridges_with_Optimus_Prime" title="Building Bridges with Optimus Prime">Building Bridges with Optimus Prime</a></span>
</p><p>When the Great War drained the planet of its <a href="/wiki/Energon" title="Energon">energon</a>, Optimus launched the life-giving <a href="/wiki/AllSpark" title="AllSpark">AllSpark</a> into a space bridge to prevent Decepticon victory. Though Optimus hoped it would remain lost forever, the artifact ended up on the distant planet <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, with the Decepticons travelling there to claim it. The Autobots followed them, in meteoric starships, to defend the developing planet from Decepticon aggression. As an <a href="/wiki/Altmode" title="Altmode" class="mw-redirect">altmode</a>, Optimus scanned a truck, a form that forced him to be careful about where he powered down for the night, lest he arouse suspicion.
</p><p>During a mission that took the Autobots across <a href="/wiki/Idaho" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>, they briefly stopped off at a drive-in theater but could not stay to watch the whole movie, though Optimus hoped to one day return.
</p><p>When <a href="/wiki/You" title="You">a human</a> offered up their property as a place for the Autobots to power down for the night, Optimus repaid the kindness with a story of the Cybertronians' history. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Transformers" title="History of the Transformers">History of the Transformers</a></span> Some time later, Optimus, Bumblebee and Ironhide assisted with recovery and bridge reconstruction following a flash flood. When Bumblebee and Ironhide started arguing over where the three should stay for the night, Optimus stood aside, hoping they would work things out themselves. Thankfully, the same human called and offered them a place to stay, immediately defusing the argument. In gratitude for both the hospitality and for unknowingly solving the conflict, Optimus retold the story of Jetfire and the Benevolous Bridge. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Building_Bridges_with_Optimus_Prime" title="Building Bridges with Optimus Prime">Building Bridges with Optimus Prime</a></span>

<p>Replacing <a href="/wiki/Santa_Claus" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> for at least a year, Optimus Prime delivered holiday cheer to the naughty and the nice as he rolled through a winter wonderland.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup>

<p>Optimus Prime inherited the mantle of Prime from his predecessor, just in time to have to deal with a <a href="/wiki/Great_War_(G1)" title="Great War (G1)">massive civil war</a> against the Decepticons. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_2" title="Transformers (2023) issue 2">Transformers #2</a></span> Optimus led the Autobots in several battles against their enemies, including one resulting in the death of <a href="/wiki/Genvo" title="Genvo">Genvo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)" title="Starscream (G1)">Ulchtar</a>'s recruitment to the Decepticons. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_13" title="Transformers (2023) issue 13">Transformers #13</a></span> As the Autobots' numbers dwindled, Optimus decided that the Autubots should leave <a href="/wiki/Cybertron_(planet)" title="Cybertron (planet)">Cybertron</a> on the <i><a href="/wiki/Ark_(G1)" title="Ark (G1)">Ark</a></i>. Unfortunately, the Decepticons pursued and in their struggle, the ship crashed onto the planet <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_2" title="Transformers (2023) issue 2">Transformers #2</a></span> During the battle, Optimus arrived just in time to see <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a> kill <a href="/wiki/Brawn_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Brawn (G1)">Brawn</a>. The two leaders engaged in battle, Optimus repeatedly pleading his enemy to stop.

This spurred Optimus to activate his <a href="/wiki/Energon-axe" title="Energon-axe">Energon-axe</a> and cut Metatron's cannon arm off and kick the Decepticon leader (almost) out of the ship. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_Energon_Universe_Special_story" title="Transformers Energon Universe Special story" class="mw-redirect">Transformers Energon Universe Special story</a></span> When <a href="/wiki/Beachcomber_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Beachcomber (G1)">Beachcomber</a> finally reached the crashed Ark, Optimus' damaged visage convinced him to not reactivate the Transformers as to not reignite the war on Earth. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_10" title="Transformers (2023) issue 10">Transformers #10</a></span>

<p>Prime lay in stasis along with many of the other Autobots and Decepticons until <a href="/wiki/Jetfire_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Jetfire (G1)">Jetfire</a>, who Optimus had known before becoming Prime, arrived at the <i>Ark</i> and made an attempt to repair and revive his brethren using <a href="/wiki/Teletraan_One" title="Teletraan One" class="mw-redirect">Teletraan One</a>, unaware of the war. After <a href="/wiki/Starscream_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Starscream (G1)">Starscream</a> was revived, he attempted to destroy the still-slumbering Autobots, but was held back by a horrified Jetfire long enough for Teletraan One to revive Optimus, who clotheslined Starscream before he could shoot a dormant <a href="/wiki/Jazz_(G1)" title="Jazz (G1)">Jazz</a>.
</p><p>As Prime and Starscream grappled, <a href="/wiki/Spike_Witwicky_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Spike Witwicky (G1)">Spike Witwicky</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carly_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Carly (G1)">Carly</a>, having witnessed the whole affair, tried to flee the ensuing chaos past them. Prime noticed the two humans and tried to shield them from Starscream's <a href="/wiki/Null_ray" title="Null ray" class="mw-redirect">null ray</a> shots, just in time for a freshly reawakened <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Ratchet (G1)">Ratchet</a> to intervene. However, <a href="/wiki/Skywarp_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Skywarp (G1)">Skywarp</a> soon followed him and helped bring <a href="/wiki/Soundwave_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Soundwave (G1)">Soundwave</a> in easy range of Teletraan One so he could be revived next. Realizing they would soon be outnumbered, Prime decided to retreat, ordering Ratchet to load as many dormant Autobots as he could into the <a href="/wiki/Combat_Deck" title="Combat Deck" class="mw-redirect">Combat Deck</a> while he distracted the Decepticons. Noticing his <a href="/wiki/Ion_blaster" title="Ion blaster">ion blaster</a>, Prime leapt for it, but Soundwave, now revived, fired a missile salvo that knocked him down.
</p><p>While reeling from the blast, Optimus was shocked to discover the corpse of <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Bumblebee (G1)">Bumblebee</a>, who had been shot in the face before he could be revived. A mournful Prime cradled his fallen scout, giving Starscream an opening to grab him from behind as Soundwave dispatched <a href="/wiki/Ravage_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Ravage (G1)">Ravage</a> to assist. Fortunately, it was then that Spike and Carly leapt into action, pushing the ion blaster within Prime's reach, allowing him to shoot Ravage and get away from Starscream and Skywarp. Realizing that more Decepticons would be revived if Teletraan One was allowed to continue, a heavy-hearted Optimus shot the computer, forestalling any more revivals. He then grabbed Spike and Carly and rejoined Ratchet as they transformed into their new Earth-based <a href="/wiki/Alternate_modes" title="Alternate modes" class="mw-redirect">alternate modes</a> and fled the <i>Ark</i>.

<p>Even out of the <i>Ark</i>, the Autobots had to contend with strafing from Starscream and Skywarp until they received some assistance from a wounded Jetfire. Jetfire wound up being shot down and seriously injured during the fight, but the energy-deprived Decepticons were forced to abandon their pursuit.
</p><p>As the Autobots took refuge in an old quarry, Prime tried to console Jetfire, but to his regret, he was only able to deliver bad news about Cybertron's fate. Optimus was about to use the <a href="/wiki/Matrix_of_Leadership" title="Matrix of Leadership">Matrix of Leadership</a> to try and repair Jetfire when Ratchet informed him that Jetfire was beyond help, even for the Matrix. Jetfire then asked Prime if there was any hope. Prime was unable to give him an answer, and Jetfire died lamenting his failure to save Cybertron. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_1" title="Transformers (2023) issue 1">Transformers #1</a></span>

I hope nothing bad happens to either of them."</div></div></div>
<p>The next day, Prime took a moment to take in Earth's natural environment. Unfortunately, he was distracted enough that he accidentally crushed a deer underfoot. Spike, having noticed, tried to say he understood, but Prime, unnerved by the fragility of Earth's environment, felt he should have known better. He then got to talking with Spike, and told him the story of how the Autobots and Decepticons arrived on Earth. Spike then expressed condolences for the loss of Bumblebee.
</p><p>Their conversation was interrupted by <a href="/wiki/Cliffjumper_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Cliffjumper (G1)">Cliffjumper</a>, who had just been revived using the Combat Deck's energon supply and metals from the quarry. Prime then discussed their options with Ratchet, who explained that their energon levels were dangerously low. Once again, Optimus considered using the Matrix, but Ratchet pointed out that doing so would drain energy directly from Prime's life force. The discussion was interrupted by an explosion at a power plant off in the distance – one that <a href="/wiki/Sparkplug_Witwicky#Energon_Universe" title="Sparkplug Witwicky">Spike's father</a> worked at. Realizing the explosion was the result of a Decepticon attack, Prime went into action, reluctantly taking a concerned Spike with him. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_2" title="Transformers (2023) issue 2">Transformers #2</a></span>
</p><p>The two arrived in time to prevent Skywarp from killing Carly and Cliffjumper. Optimus told Spike to take cover as he engaged the Decepticon in battle. Skywarp's teleportation abilities initially threw the Autobot commander off-guard, but Optimus quickly gained the upper hand. He commended his foe for a battle hard fought as he readied his Energon-axe to finish the fight.
</p><p>Small problem: the nearby humans didn't realize Optimus was fighting <i>for</i> them; they simply thought he was just another dangerous robot to be defended against. So, on "Sparky's" command, local bartender <a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=Danny&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Danny (page does not exist)">Danny</a> launched an RPG right into Optimus' axe arm right before he could finish Skywarp, severely damaging it. Skywarp then capitalized on this by repeatedly firing straight into the wound, remarking that, like Optimus, the humans weren't just weak but also stupid. Spike attempted to rush in to help right as Sparky ordered his men to open fire, and a stray bullet caught the boy in the abdomen.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:212px;"><a href="/wiki/File:TF2023_%E2%80%93_Prime_Bashes_Skywarp.jpg" class="image"><img alt="(thumbnail)" src="/mediawiki/images2/thumb/9/9d/TF2023_%E2%80%93_Prime_Bashes_Skywarp.jpg/210px-TF2023_%E2%80%93_Prime_Bashes_Skywarp.jpg" width="210" height="182" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:TF2023_%E2%80%93_Prime_Bashes_Skywarp.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/mediawiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>"I'm gonna LIIIIIVE! And I'll marry Elita! And we'll grow old together!"</div></div></div>
<p>Skywarp prepared to kill the human, an act which spurred Optimus into a rage. He'd have no more of the Decepticons' plundering of Earth, so he <i>tore off his own damaged arm</i> and proceeded to beat Skywarp senseless with it. With his foe subdued, Optimus turned his attention to the injured Spike. He was reminded of the deer he'd accidentally trampled and, determined to not repeat that mistake, took the boy in his remaining hand. As he transformed, he beckoned Sparky into his cab, promising to save his son. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_3" title="Transformers (2023) issue 3">Transformers #3</a></span>
</p><p>Optimus raced the two to a nearby hospital, but Starscream caught up while on the road and fired on them. This prompted Optimus to contact Ratchet for assistance, but a shot from Starscream cut the conversation short. However, before Starscream could stop them, the Decepticon was swept off his feet by Cliffjumper and Carly, allowing Optimus to run him over. 
</p><p>The group reached the hospital, Optimus pleading with the doctors to help Spike. The fight wasn't yet over; <a href="/wiki/Laserbeak_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Laserbeak (G1)">Laserbeak</a> arrived and exchanged fire with Optimus and Cliffjumper. However, the pair were blindsided by <a href="/wiki/Rumble_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Rumble (G1)">Rumble</a> and Soundwave, leaving Optimus at the end of Soundwave's blaster. His death was postponed by Starscream who, upon realizing what the hospital was for, decided to make the end more painful for the Autobot leader and began firing on the building. Then, the group was met with the arrival of Ratchet and the newly revived <a href="/wiki/Jazz_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Jazz (G1)">Jazz</a>, the later of which dispatched the two larger Decepticons. The Autobots rallied, Optimus asking the Decepticons if they would like to continue. They did not, and so retreated.

<div class="thumb tleft"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:127px;"><a href="/wiki/File:TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime_and_Sparky_Commiserate.jpg" class="image"><img alt="(thumbnail)" src="/mediawiki/images2/thumb/9/9f/TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime_and_Sparky_Commiserate.jpg/125px-TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime_and_Sparky_Commiserate.jpg" width="125" height="184" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime_and_Sparky_Commiserate.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/mediawiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div>"Look at me; judge me by my size, do you?"</div></div></div>
<p>Following the battle, Optimus watched as one of the doctors explained to Sparky that the hospital's generator had been hit during Starscream's barrage, and without power, the machines needed to keep Spike and several other patients alive could not function. Spurred by Sparky's affection for his son, Optimus vowed there would be no more death, and opened the Matrix to restore power to the hospital's machinery. Afterward, Optimus was approached by a young patient who wished to see the robot transform. While obliging the human, Sparky approached to ask if Optimus could use the Matrix to bring Spike out of his coma. Optimus explained he had used all the energy left in the Matrix, so Spike's fate would be left to the <a href="/wiki/Primus" title="Primus">Great Spark</a>. When Sparky asked if he was a god (due to his size), Optimus laughed and said he could say the same of humans; they were small but mighty.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:172px;"><a href="/wiki/File:TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime%27s_New_Arm.jpg" class="image"><img alt="(thumbnail)" src="/mediawiki/images2/thumb/f/f4/TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime%27s_New_Arm.jpg/170px-TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime%27s_New_Arm.jpg" width="170" height="261" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:TF2023-4_%E2%80%93_Prime%27s_New_Arm.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"><img src="/mediawiki/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png" width="15" height="11" alt="" /></a></div><a href="/wiki/Gilthor" title="Gilthor">Gilthor</a>? I hardly knew 'er!</div></div></div>
<p>Optimus convened with Ratchet and Jazz after the former repaired the hospital's generator. The medic chastised Optimus for using the Matrix to help the humans instead of repairing himself. Optimus defended his decision, as they had brought their war to the planet and that the humans were innocent. Ratchet challenged the notion that humans were innocent, pointing to Spike's injury, but Optimus asserted this simply made them alike. The conversation was cut short as Jazz ran out of energy, Optimus urging his friend to rest. Optimus reasserted that the humans were worth saving, so Ratchet diverted his attention to a potential advantage he had brought along in the Combat Deck: <a href="/wiki/Megatron_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Megatron (G1)">Megatron</a>'s arm and <a href="/wiki/Fusion_cannon" title="Fusion cannon">fusion cannon</a>. Optimus initially refused, but at the urging of Ratchet, as well as Sparky's offer to help with the Autobot's energy problem, Optimus donned the arm and gathered Cliffjumper to go on the offensive. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_4" title="Transformers (2023) issue 4">Transformers #4</a></span> Optimus then commiserated with Sparky some more, finding that he too had been scarred by war. Prime then lamented that the war had changed him for the worse, turning him into the very thing he had sworn to oppose.
</p><p>Now with technical help from Sparky and a half-rebuilt <a href="/wiki/Wheeljack_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Wheeljack (G1)">Wheeljack</a>, Optimus led an expedition to the dam that provided power to the power plant, in order to build a turbine to provide energy to the Autobots and the town of Farmingham. Once the turbine was operational, Prime ordered that it be used to revive more Autobot warriors before himself, starting with <a href="/wiki/Arcee_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Arcee (G1)">Arcee</a>.
</p><p>But just as she was revived, the Decepticons, now with fresh warriors of their own, attacked the dam. As Ratchet and Arcee rushed to get Jazz back in action, Prime used the fusion cannon to blow <a href="/wiki/Reflector_(G1)" title="Reflector (G1)">Reflector</a> to bits, then slammed <a href="/wiki/Frenzy_(G1)" title="Frenzy (G1)">Frenzy</a> to the ground. He was then dismayed to see Carly falling from the top of the dam, but luckily Arcee was able to save her. Starscream then confronted Optimus directly, scorning Prime for using the fusion cannon for his own purposes. Optimus responded by taunting him over how the weapon represented everything the Deception Air Commander would never be. An enraged Starscream then slipped past Optimus and severely damaged the turbine. Prime responded by blasting Starscream with the fusion cannon, prompting the latter to order a retreat.

<p>This time, Optimus elected to press the numerical advantage the Autobots had over the Decepticons, and launch an offensive to recapture the <i>Ark</i>. Sparky came with, but Prime and Sparky, wanting to avoid a repeat of Spike, turned down Carly's request to come along (but Cliffjumper surreptitiously brought her anyway). Seeing the Autobot starship was enough to wake an old memory for Sparky, but just as Prime asked what was wrong, an explosion rocked the area and he was violently rammed by <a href="/wiki/Long_Haul_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Long Haul (G1)">Long Haul</a>. Starscream then revealed that he had rebuilt and regained control of Teletraan One and used it to recover from the battle and rebuild the <a href="/wiki/Constructicon_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Constructicon (G1)">Constructicons</a> while he was at it. As Prime and the others looked on, the Decepticons revealed their newest advantage – <a href="/wiki/Devastator_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Devastator (G1)">Devastator</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_5" title="Transformers (2023) issue 5">Transformers #5</a></span> Optimus and the Autobots then retreated to the <i>Ark</i>, dragging the wounded Ratchet with him before swiftly kicking Starscream in the head. He then shielded Sparky as Devastator grabbed his leg and threw him around like a toy, leaving him incapacitated.
</p><p>Arcee then dragged him into the spacecraft and to a medical bay where Ratchet attempted to repair him, but his wounds were too extensive. Optimus then lamented on how he had failed his friends, recounting Jetfire's regrets. He then took out the Matrix, attempting to pass it onto one of the other Autobots, but he was too weak to hold it and it fell to the floor. Asking Prime to take care of his son and the Earth, Sparky then stepped into the Matrix, restoring its energy and repairing Optimus in the process. 
</p>

<p>As the Decepticons burst into the room to carry out their assault, Optimus ripped Devastator's finger off before firing a barrage against the gestalt using both Megatron's fusion cannon and his own ion blaster, then dropkicking Devastator right in the head. He then led Devastator away, using the fusion cannon as a booster, before taunting Devastator and then using the enraged combiner's momentum to throw him over the edge, wounding Starscream and forcing Devastator to separate into his components. As the Decepticons retreated, Optimus approached Soundwave and attempted to offer him an olive branch. Soundwave responded by trying to attack Prime, only for Prime to catch his punch, stating that while he desired peace, he was no fool. He then watched as the Decepticon communications officer flew off into the distance with <a href="/wiki/Thundercracker_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Thundercracker (G1)">Thundercracker</a>. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_6" title="Transformers (2023) issue 6">Transformers #6</a></span> Apparently, he was filmed by a government drone during these events. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Duke_issue_5" title="Duke issue 5">Duke #5</a></span>

<p>Some time later, Prime and Ratchet visited Spike at the hospital, but Spike, not yet over his father's death, was reluctant to talk to them. On the drive back to the <i>Ark</i>, Optimus, feeling responsible for Sparky's fate, still felt he owed Spike something. It was then that Prime had a vision of holding an infant Spike in his arms that caused him to veer off the road.
</p><p>On returning to the <i>Ark</i>, Optimus decided that the Decepticons couldn't be allowed to run roughshod over the Earth. Wheeljack pointed out that first they'd need a means to <i>find</i> the Decepticons – preferably an eye in the sky – to which Prime responded that he knew just where to find one. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_7" title="Transformers (2023) issue 7">Transformers #7</a></span> While Ratchet set to work partially rebuilding Jetfire, Prime checked in on Wheeljack, who was unable to break through the integrated Skywarp's hold on Teletraan One. Prime looked over logs of Skywarp's dismemberment at the hands of Starscream and Soundwave and wondered if Skywarp could be convinced to allow the other Autobots to be rebuilt. This however, wasn't good enough for Carly, who prepared to kill Skywarp with an RPG. Prime tried to convince Carly to stand down, but she accidentally fired the weapon anyway, and Arcee had to block the projectile with her body. The display wound up moving Skywarp enough that he rebuilt Wheeljack's legs. Prime tried to use this as an example to Carly that help could come from strange places, but she was unreceptive.
</p><p>Later troubled by more visions of an infant Spike, Prime's reverie was interrupted by Jetfire's partial resurrection, though he was stuck in vehicle mode, blinded, and unable to move by himself. When Jetfire, panicked by his new situation, asked not to be left alone, Prime offered to stay with him.

<p>Afterward, when word reached Prime of renewed Decepticon activity, Optimus ordered an offensive to sort them out. Carly wanted to come along, but Prime vetoed the idea, and boarded Jetfire along with Cliffjumper, Jazz, and Ratchet. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_8" title="Transformers (2023) issue 8">Transformers #8</a></span> When they arrived however, the situation deteriorated almost immediately as Jetfire was shot down by an energy pulse from the Decepticons' new <a href="/wiki/Space_bridge" title="Space bridge">Space bridge</a>, and Prime and the other Autobots were thrown clear from the crashing jet. As he fended off attacks from the Constructicons, Prime was shocked to see <a href="/wiki/Shockwave_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Shockwave (G1)">Shockwave</a> step through the bridge. Shockwave and Soundwave soon felled Ratchet, but Prime intervened just in time to prevent them from doing the same to Cliffjumper, and he and Shockwave battled. However, he found himself overwhelmed by four Decepticons at once, and Prime was laid low by Shockwave, who prepared to execute Optimus with his arm-cannon.
</p><p>But just then, <a href="/wiki/Elita_One_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Elita One (G1)">Elita One</a> stepped through the Space bridge carrying the emaciated <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Magnus_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Ultra Magnus (G1)">Ultra Magnus</a>, bumping into Shockwave just as he fired, causing the shot to miss. Elita was able to disable the Space bridge terminal using Prime's ion blaster, but the Autobots soon came under heavy fire, separating Optimus and the new arrivals from Cliffjumper and Jazz, and Elita advised Prime to retreat. Initially, Optimus refused, hoping to save his men, but Elita told him there was no helping them, and he reluctantly transformed to carry Elita and Magnus away. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_9" title="Transformers (2023) issue 9">Transformers #9</a></span> 
</p><p>The trio managed to return to the dam, where Wheeljack, Arcee, and Carly where siphoning more energy. When Wheeljack noted that Ratchet could get Ultra Magnus repaired in a jiffy, Optimus broke the news that Ratchet had been killed. Prime attempted to console the mechanic, but Wheeljack instead asked for some time alone. Optimus convened with Elita, expressing his desire to free Cliffjumper and Jazz from Shockwave's torture. Elita noted it would be difficult, likening it to her experience attempting to free Ultra Magnus and how desperately the Autobots on Cybertron needed Prime during that time. Elita explained all the "good" left on Cybertron had been drained by Shockwave and the Decepticon would do the same to Prime's precious Earth, something Optimus asked Elita's help in stopping. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_10" title="Transformers (2023) issue 10">Transformers #10</a></span> Wheeljack urged Optimus to postpone Magnus' repairs in favor of restoring more inert Autobots, but Magnus pleaded with the pair to let him fight. Later, Optimus, Wheeljack, and Elita One discussed the Decepticon's scheme to pull Cybertron to Earth, and Optimus' desire to rescue Cliffjumper and Jazz sparked another argument with Elita. 
</p><p>Optimus led the Autobots on a strike mission on the Nemesis, using Skywarp's abilities to sneak into the base and catch Shockwave by surprise while Elita set explosive charges on the space bridge. The group rescued Jazz while Shockwave took Cliffjumper hostage and called upon Devastator. Optimus hoped to counter the combiner with reinforcements from Ultra Magnus and Wheeljack, but Magnus retreated after seeing Shockwave. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_11" title="Transformers (2023) issue 11">Transformers #11</a></span> The group held their ground in the ensuing fire fight, Optimus unwilling to detonate the charges with Cliffjumper so close to them. Luckily, Carly's intervention gave Optimus the chance to lead to group in a counterattack. Optimus and Elita toppled Devastator and destroyed Shockwave's harvester, causing Cybertron to head back through the portal.

<p>However, Cliffjumper had been sent through the portal and Optimus would not leave him behind again. Optimus passed through the space bridge and quickly dispatched the present <a href="/wiki/Combaticon_(G1)" title="Combaticon (G1)">Combaticons</a>. Shockwave attempted to threaten Cliffjumper, but Optimus quickly destroyed his cannon arm and, amidst visions of a baby Spike being consumed by metal, crushed Shockwave's head. Elita One congratulated Optimus' return to form, which Optimus denied before attempting to return through the portal. However, Elita destroyed the smaller space bridge, hoping to keep Optimus on Cybertron and use the harvested Energon to revitalize the Autobot resistance. Optimus refused, not wanting to fuel Cybertron with the blood of another planet, and, despite Elita One's pleas, used his cannon arm to destroy the harvested Energon. The blast propelled Optimus through the planetary portal and into Earth's atmosphere, where he was rescued by Beachcomber. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_12" title="Transformers (2023) issue 12">Transformers #12</a></span>
</p><p>After the battle, Prime bade goodbye to Arcee, Beachcomber, Spike, and Carly as they left to find the still-AWOL Ultra Magnus. No sooner had they left than Prime was informed that the Decepticons had been rampaging through Tacoma. While on their way, Optimus conferred with Wheeljack over the visions he'd had been having, with Wheeljack wondering if it was the result of Sparky's absorption into the Matrix.

<p>Once they arrived at their destination, Prime was horrified at the destruction the Decepticons had wrought, and imediately ordered the Autobots to help with rescue efforts. However, they were soon stymied by a vengeful human mob and an army tank who had mistaken them for the Decepticons, even as the Autobots tried to rescue humans stuck in a bus. Prime, having another vision of infant Spike consumed by metal, flew into a rage and bent the tank's main cannon barrel before Jazz snapped him out of it. With human reinforcements arriving, the Autobots were forced to retreat.

<p>The Autobots then returned to Wheeljack's machine at Farmingham Dam, hoping to revive more warriors to compensate for Arcee and Beachcomber's abscence. But before <a href="/wiki/Trailbreaker_(G1)" title="Trailbreaker (G1)">Trailbreaker</a> could be revived, the machine was damaged by a strafing run from <a href="/wiki/Astrotrain_(G1)#Energon_Universe" title="Astrotrain (G1)">Astrotrain</a>, and the Autobots were immediately caught in between Starscream and Soundwave's warring factions of Decepticons as <a href="/wiki/Bruticus_(G1)" title="Bruticus (G1)">Bruticus</a> <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_15" title="Transformers (2023) issue 15">Transformers #15</a></span> and Devastator formed and began duking it out. As the Decepticons' internecine brawl intensified, Prime ordered the Autobots to pull back. Worried that the dam might be damaged in the crossfire, Optimus tried to appeal to Starscream and Soundwave to stop, only to be refused. Then, having another vision, Prime's eyes glowed red as he used the fusion cannon to shoot out the dam himself, and all the Decepticons were swept up in a flash flood. Horrified by his actions, Optimus tried to rescue two human children who were in the way of the flood, but they were too far away. Thankfully, they were saved by Trailbreaker's forcefield. The newly reawakened Autobot asked what was going on. Falling to his knees, Optimus could only respond "Chaos." <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_16" title="Transformers (2023) issue 16">Transformers #16</a></span>
</p><p>Wheeljack eventually informed Optimus that the Decepticons would arrive in <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> soon and questioned him about his outburst, advising him that he ought not to get involved in any more battles until they were sure of what his condition was. Optimus nevertheless rallied his men in rescuing groups of humans in the city from the destruction caused by Devastator and Bruticus' fight. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_17" title="Transformers (2023) issue 17">Transformers #17</a></span> While aiding the evacuation, Optimus watched in horror first as Devastator RKO'd Bruticus into the pavement, then as Megatron returned to assert his control over the Decepticons. At the sight of his old enemy, Optimus ordered his Autobots to retreat. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers_(2023)_issue_18" title="Transformers (2023) issue 18">Transformers #18</a></span>

<p>Optimus Prime led the Autobots to stop Megatron's attempt to cyberform Earth. After discovering that Megatron's new weapon was the <i><a href="/wiki/Proudstar" title="Proudstar">Proudstar</a></i>, Optimus initially tried to preserve the Cybertronian history contained on its <a href="/wiki/Ferrotaxis" title="Ferrotaxis">Ferrotaxis</a> supercomputer. Inside the <i>Proudstar</i>, he received a prophecy of his future death from <a href="/wiki/Teletraan_Alpha" title="Teletraan Alpha">Teletraan Alpha</a>, but he merely expressed happiness that his friends would survive. After the <a href="/wiki/Plasma_Core" title="Plasma Core">Plasma Core</a> was damaged and proved to be too great a threat to Earth, Optimus reluctantly decided to destroy it and the Ferrotaxis in order to preserve humanity's right to forge their own future. When Megatron shot shot the Ferrotaxis into space in one last spiteful effort to stop the Autobots, Prime rode an Insecticon swarm into Earth's orbit for a final showdown with Megatron, ultimately forced to destroy the Ferrotaxis. Once Megatron was again defeated, Optimus called upon the Autobots to stop merely living upon Earth and adopt the planet as their new home. Later, he and Wheeljack discussed plans for the <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Maximus_(G1)" title="Optimus Maximus (G1)">Optimus Maximus</a> project. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Devastation" title="Transformers: Devastation">Transformers: Devastation</a></span>

<p>Committed, inspirational, selfless...
Optimus Prime is all these things and more, a born leader and idealistic to boot.
But what makes him a truly great leader is his own lack of hubris; his seeming inability to place his life, his worth, above any of his fellow Autobots, or in fact any other lifeform.
He believes, passionately, that freedom is the right of all sentient beings, and would gladly sacrifice himself to make that belief a reality. <span class="tt1_storylink"><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Earth_Wars" title="Transformers: Earth Wars">Optimus Prime Bio</a></span>

<p>During the Cybertronian Civil War, Sentinel Prime was killed. Prior to his destruction, he bestowed the Matrix of Leadership to Optimus Prime, who became the new leader of the Autobots. Despite being one of the youngest Cybertronian leaders, Optimus demonstrated extraordinary courage and wisdom in the war against the Decepticons. He: treated all lives with benevolence, fought for freedom and peace, and continues to fight to protect the weak and maintain their beliefs.

</p><p>Optimus would find that it was in their best interests to first establish a base of operations. After detecting a Supplies Cache, Optimus brings the Commander and a squad of freshly integrated Inter-dimensional soldiers to investigate the area, only to find a very trigger-happy Rhinox guarding the Cache.
</p><p>After knocking some sense into Rhinox, Optimus would bring Ratchet and Sideswipe to investigate another disturbance in the Frequencies that Teletraan 1 was picking up, and they eventually ran into a bunch of sharks! 
</p><p>After some developmental research, Ratchet reported that the reason everyone on New Quintessa was so triggerhappy was because of the presence of an unnatural amount of Dark Energon! 
Optimus tries to tell this to Windblade, and tells her to ignore the voices in her head, but it's of no avail as she succumbs and Optimus has to knock some sense into her.

<ul><li>According to <a href="/wiki/Bob_Budiansky" title="Bob Budiansky">Bob Budiansky</a>, longtime comics writer <a href="/wiki/Denny_O%27Neil" title="Denny O'Neil">Denny O'Neil</a> named Optimus Prime prior to Budiansky being brought on to the <i>Transformers</i> project. ("Optimus" is Latin for "best", therefore his name can be literally translated as "Best First".)
</li><li>Optimus Prime's Japanese name is "Convoy", which is named after his original name "Battle Convoy" in the <i><a href="/wiki/Diaclone" title="Diaclone">Diaclone</a></i> toyline, because the name "Optimus Prime" is difficult for Japanese kids to remember and pronounce.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[8]</a></sup> All Optimus-inspired characters were called variations of Convoy in Japan up until the <a href="/wiki/Transformers_(film)" title="Transformers (film)">2007 <i>Transformers</i> film</a>, at which point <a href="/wiki/TakaraTomy" title="TakaraTomy">TakaraTomy</a> changed their minds and began using the name Optimus Prime as well. Presumably to avoid confusion, this change includes the Generation 1 version of the character as well, who is now called Optimus Prime in newer products and fiction such as <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers_United" title="Transformers United">Transformers United</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_All_Spark" title="Transformers: All Spark">Transformers: All Spark</a></i>, though his name remains Convoy in material aimed at adult collectors such as <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Alternity" title="Transformers: Alternity">Alternity</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Transformers:_Masterpiece" title="The Transformers: Masterpiece">Masterpiece</a></i>.
</li><li>"Orion Pax" is composed of "Orion", the huntsman from Greek mythology, and the Latin word "pax", meaning "peace". The original cartoon design for him appears to <a href="/wiki/File:UltraMagnus-FloroDery3rdConcept-OrionPax.jpg" title="File:UltraMagnus-FloroDery3rdConcept-OrionPax.jpg">be based on an early Ultra Magnus concept</a>. 
</li><li>According to an early <i><a href="/wiki/The_Transformers_Universe_(Marvel)" title="The Transformers Universe (Marvel)">Universe</a></i>-style profile published in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Transformers_Comics_Magazine" title="The Transformers Comics Magazine">The Transformers Comics Magazine</a></i>, Optimus Prime's "official" nicknames were at one point considered to be "Autobot Commander", "Chief", "Big Boss" and "Roller". As far as it is known, no piece of fiction has ever purposely addressed him using these nicknames, though it's a fair bet he's been called "chief" at least once or twice anyway. And technically <i>part</i> of him is called "<a href="/wiki/Roller_(G1)" title="Roller (G1)">Roller</a>" with some frequency.
</li><li>Optimus Prime has fictionally shown a dislike of certain kinds of music and dance. For the <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics_continuity" title="Marvel Comics continuity">Marvel Comics continuity</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Letters_page_(Marvel_UK)" title="Letters page (Marvel UK)">letters page</a> for <a href="/wiki/Still_Life!" title="Still Life!">issue 324</a> mentions he hates the music of <a href="/wiki/M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe" title="Mötley Crüe">Mötley Crüe</a>. In the cartoon continuity, "<a href="/wiki/Blaster_Blues" title="Blaster Blues">Blaster Blues</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Quest_for_Survival" title="Quest for Survival">Quest for Survival</a>" have Optimus react noticeably more passive-aggressively to Blaster's choice of music than the other Autobots. And in the <a href="/wiki/Dreamwave_Generation_One_continuity" title="Dreamwave Generation One continuity">Dreamwave Generation One continuity</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Hardwired" title="Transformers: Hardwired">Hardwired</a></i> features an uncalled for negative remark about Jazz's dance skills.
</li><li>According to the staff of <i><a href="/wiki/Beast_Wars:_Transformers_(cartoon)" title="Beast Wars: Transformers (cartoon)">Beast Wars</a></i>, Optimus Prime became a space explorer in the <a href="/wiki/Beast_Era" title="Beast Era">Beast Era</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup>
</li><li>Writer <a href="/wiki/Bob_Skir" title="Bob Skir">Bob Skir</a> claims that neither the statue from "<a href="/wiki/Fires_of_the_Past" title="Fires of the Past">Fires of the Past</a>" nor the golden disks in its hands were mentioned in the script. However, he suggested that they were either the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Disk_(Voyager)" title="Golden Disk (Voyager)">disks</a> from the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes, or that Optimus won them in the 2,395,989th Annual Cybertronian spelling bee.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[10]</a></sup> We're betting on the latter.

<ul><li>By the time Optimus Prime appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Beast_Machines:_Transformers_(cartoon)" title="Beast Machines: Transformers (cartoon)">Beast Machines</a></i>, his 3D model from <i>Beast Wars</i> had apparently been lost, leading the animators to use a faceplated Optimus Primal head as a quick replacement to save time and budget.
</li><li>Aside from occasionally having Alpha Trion as a father figure, Optimus Prime may have a mother! In an advertisement for <a href="/wiki/Pepsi_Convoy" title="Pepsi Convoy">Pepsi Convoy</a> that shows him in a refrigerator (along with <a href="/wiki/Destron_Pizza" title="Destron Pizza">Destron Pizza</a>), a note attached to a nearby piece of Tupperware reads:
</li></ul>
<dl><dd><i>Dear Convoy</i>
</dd><dd><i>Warm it before you eat</i>
</dd><dd><i>Mom</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Although the ad itself is for Pepsi Convoy, he is a separate character, and it can be assumed that the note was left for Convoy/Optimus Prime himself.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li>The first wave of Dreamwave posters in 2001 identified Optimus Prime as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041220175419/http://www.comicden.com/merch/posters.htm">"Captimus Primus"</a>, which is tantalizingly close to making some sort of sense.
</li><li>The name "Optronix" originates behind-the-scenes at <a href="/wiki/Dreamwave_Productions" title="Dreamwave Productions">Dreamwave Productions</a>, but it's not known for certain who coined it. It appears in material created by <a href="/wiki/Destination_Entertainment" title="Destination Entertainment">Destination Entertainment</a> for the <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_More_than_Meets_the_Eye" title="Transformers: More than Meets the Eye">More than Meets the Eye</a></i> profile series,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[11]</a></sup> but when <a href="/wiki/James_McDonough" title="James McDonough">James McDonough</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adam_Patyk" title="Adam Patyk">Adam Patyk</a> took over the project, the name was among many things cut from the series. By the time of the release of <a href="/wiki/Simon_Furman" title="Simon Furman">Simon Furman</a>'s prequel series <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_War_Within" title="Transformers: The War Within">The War Within</a></i>, the name had already been disseminated into the fandom somehow,<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[12]</a></sup> but the series itself makes no mention of it—in fact, the dialogue is conspicuously written to avoid calling Optimus <i>anything</i> until he becomes Prime! Although Furman was then known to generally eschew concepts originating in the original cartoon—such as "Orion Pax"—it seems likely that, were he the one to come up with the name, he would have prominently placed it in that script. The only time Furman used the name was with the later publication of <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_Ultimate_Guide" title="Transformers: The Ultimate Guide">Transformers: The Ultimate Guide</a></i>, which was in turn provided as reference to the contractors writing the <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers_Legends_(book)" title="Transformers Legends (book)">Transformers Legends</a></i> anthology. The only other Dreamwave media to use the name "Optronix" is <a href="/wiki/Scott_Ciencin" title="Scott Ciencin">Scott Ciencin</a>'s novel <i><a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Hardwired" title="Transformers: Hardwired">Transformers: Hardwired</a></i>. The name cropped up a couple of times more, in the packaging bio for <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)/toys#Titanium_Series" title="Optimus Prime (G1)/toys"><i>Titanium Series</i> Optimus Prime</a> and as the pre-Prime name for <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(SG)" title="Optimus Prime (SG)">Optimus' <i>Shattered Glass</i> incarnation</a>, but otherwise—in particular following the development of <a href="/wiki/Aligned_continuity_family" title="Aligned continuity family">the "Aligned" continuity</a>—the name "Orion Pax" seems to have been cemented as Optimus Prime's original name.
