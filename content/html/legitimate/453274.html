<H2>The use of videotape</H2>

Although it was recorded live, <i>An Evening with Fred Astaire</i> used a number of innovative production techniques that are now commonplace, such as <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("23007",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("23007")' href="/topics/Chroma_key">chroma key</a><span class="hp" id="m23007"><div class="hpHeader">Chroma key</div><div class="hpContent">Chroma key compositing  is a technique for compositing  two images together.

In 1988, the show earned a further technical Emmy Award for Ed Reitan, Don Kent, and Dan Einstein, who restored the original videotape, transferring its contents to a modern format.
