<code>comp.binaries.cbm</code> is a moderated, binaries-only newsgroup for
the dissemination and distribution of binaries for and related to the 
Commodore 8-bit computers, including the Commodore 64, the Commodore 128,
the VIC-20, +4/16, PET series and others. It is not an Amiga newsgroup.
<p>
Files posted to the group have included games, demos, utilities, data files,
emulators/emulator utilities and instruction binaries (such as schematics).
All files on <code>comp.binaries.cbm</code> are freely distributable and are
stored in the Unix de facto <code>uucode</code> standard. uudecoders for the
64 are available many places, including from the <a href =
"ftp://ftp.armory.com/pub/user/spectre/">Computer Workshops FTP archive</a>,
and this <a href = "uudecode.txt">BASIC program by Craig Bruce</a> will also
suffice until something faster can be found.
<p>
The official FAQ is available <a href = "faq.txt">here</a> in plaintext.
(HTML soon.)
