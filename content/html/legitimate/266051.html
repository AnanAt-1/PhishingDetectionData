<h1>Fenestra</h1>
<h2>An Eiffel GUI library for the Win32 platform</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Fenestra is a Win32 API GUI library, which while being specific to the Win32 API is high level enough to allow convenient programming in an object oriented manner. It also aims to be portable to any of the actively supported Eiffel compilers for the Win32 platforms, allowing users to mix and match compilers as they wishes.</p>

<p>It is a freeware library. The full source code is distributed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eiffel.php">Eiffel Forum licence</a>, which is liberal enough to allow almost any use, including commercial applications, as long as the copyright notice is maintained and improvements are made available to the public, when the library is used for programs widely distributed.</p>

<p>While being a library for Win32, it is hoped that it is compatible with third parties implementations of the API, possibly allowing portability to other platforms.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Eiffel 3 compiler with ELKS-95 compliant kernel library</li>
<li>Win32 API implementation</li>
<li>C compiler and ETL-style Eiffel/C interface for the default runtime. (The system is designed so that the low-level runtime could be easily replaced in a non-C environment.)</li>
</ul>
