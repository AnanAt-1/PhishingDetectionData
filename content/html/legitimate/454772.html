Texas A&M's biggest rival is the Texas Longhorns.  The university has other significant rivals but few come close to the rivalry shared between Texas A&M and the University of Texas.  The mutual respect and desire to win has given rise to the Lone Star Showdown, an athletic competition that lasts year-round and encompasses all regular-season NCAA athletic events between the two schools.
