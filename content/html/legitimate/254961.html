<p><font face="Arial">The evolution of computing technology has
produced some very interesting devices. However long the list,
it&#146;s a good bet that a ZISC chip should be on it. ZISC
stands for Zero Instruction Set Computer and it&#146;s a
technology that was jointly developed by IBM in Paris and by Guy
Paillet, Chairman of Sunnyvale, CA-based Silicon Recognition,
Inc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Although it may sound like to contradiction
to refer to a computer as having zero instructions, that is
actually a pretty good description of this technology. The first
generation of ZISC chip contains 36 independent cells that can be
thought of as neurons or parallel processors. Each of these cells
is designed to compare an input vector of up to 64 Bytes with a
similar vector stored in the cell&#146;s memory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If the input vector matches the vector in
the cell&#146;s memory, it fires. Otherwise, it doesn&#146;t. As
a parallel architecture, the ZISC chip tells all 36 cells to
compare their memory to the input vector at the same time. As
output, the chip effectively provides the number of the cell that
had a match or indicates that no matches occurred.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Silicon Recognition has developed a
technology around the ZISC chips called Parallel Associative
Learning Memory, or PALM. PALM Technology combines a control
system, typically an FPGA and DRAM memory, with one or more ZISC
chips to create a standalone, hardwired recognition system</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In a traditional serial environment devoted
to pattern matching, a computer program basically loads a pattern
into memory, then fetches a stored pattern from each location in
a large array. After fetching the pattern, it does a comparison,
then fetches the data from the next location and continues the
process. As the number of patterns you need to check grows, the
speed of the process decreases. With a very fast computer, tens
or hundreds of patterns may be able to be checked in a real-time
environment, but eventually, a limit is reached.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is because you need to look at
what&#146;s in every array location to see if there is a match.
With ZISC chips and PALM technology, the system provides the
location of the match without having to look at what&#146;s in
that location. Instead of looking at the problem as
&quot;What&#146;s in array location 12 and does it match?&quot;
the problem becomes &quot;location 12 matches.&quot; By
eliminating the step of loading and comparing the pattern for
each location, the speed of the system increases dramatically.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you only need to compare an input
pattern to 36 potential matches, it&#146;s tough to see how ZISC
computing provides a real advantage over traditional computing.
However, the real power of ZISC is in its scalability. A ZISC
network can be expanded by adding more ZISC devices without
suffering a decrease in recognition speed. According to Silicon
Recognition, there is no theoretical limitation on the number of
cells that can be in a network. The company regularly discusses
networks with 10,000 or more cells.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">One way to think about this is to imagine a
large sports arena with seating for 10,000 people. If you make an
announcement over the public address system, every person in the
stadium hears it at virtually the same time and can process the
announcement in a truly parallel fashion. In a serial version,
the announcer may move from seat to seat and speak with one
person at a time. Let&#146;s say the goal is to determine if
&quot;Sheldon Liebman is in the house.&quot; With parallel
processing, I can immediately stand up and shout &quot;Section A,
Row 12, Seat 3.&quot; In the serial version, the process is much
slower.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Thus far, we&#146;ve illustrated the
process of finding an exact match to an input vector, but ZISC
chips can also be used to find fuzzy matches. Instead of asking
if there&#146;s an exact match, you can ask for the closest
match. Then, cells that are above a certain threshold fire
simultaneously and the controller in the chip looks at which one
returns the closest value. For example, location 12 may have a
63/64 match and location 14 has 62/64. In this case, the system
returns that location 12 is the &quot;best&quot; match. At that
point, higher level software can determine if the match is
&quot;appropriate&quot; through automatic or manual methods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This leads us into the area of training a
ZISC-based system to perform pattern recognition. As an example,
let&#146;s assume that we are trying to categorize apples on a
conveyor belt as Red, Green or Yellow. We might start to picking
100 different Red apples and presenting them to the system. If
they match an existing pattern, they are classified as Red. If
they don&#146;t, we instruct the system to add this pattern to a
new cell. Next we do the same with 100 Green apples and 100
Yellow apples. Now, the first 100 locations define Red, the
second 100 Define Green and the third 100 define Yellow. Based on
which location is returned as a match, we can begin to classify
our apples. However, it&#146;s reasonable to assume that
eventually, we&#146;ll get an apple that confuses the system.
When this occurs, we can add the pattern for this apple to a new
cell and instruct the system as to whether that new cell refers
to Red, Yellow or Green. You can also instruct by counterexample.
If the system mistakes a Green apple for a Red one, you can
&quot;correct&quot; it and add the pattern to a new cell.
Eventually, the system will &quot;learn&quot; the different to a
very high degree of accuracy. If you have 1000 sample apples, for
example, you may want to use the first 300 to train the system
and the next 700 to test it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The characteristics of the ZISC chip make
it useful in two very specific situations. The first is as a
recognition engine plugged into a traditional computer. Silicon
Recognition actually offers PCI, ISA and VME cards that fit this
description. In this environment, the ZISC chips are used to
offload the recognition function from a general-purpose computer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The second application is where you need to
tie recognition to a particular function that isn&#146;t being
controlled by a full-size computer. ZISC chips use very little
power and can be put into very portable environments. For this
type of application, Silicon Recognition offers 84-pin SIMs
(Single Inline Modules) that contain either 3 or 6 ZISC chips
with up to 216 processors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The company provided a real world example
of this type of application in the agriculture industry. A
computerized system was developed to spray weeds that grow
intermixed with crops. A system was developed that places a
camera on a moving appliance that covers twelve rows of crops at
a time and has 12 spray nozzles attached, one for each row.
Moving at approximately two miles per hour, the camera captures
data and the ZISC chips determine if the spray head is over
ground, crop or weed. If it&#146;s over weeds, the spray head is
activated. In this type of environment, a full size computer just
can&#146;t be used.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are a number of other applications
that are particularly well suited to ZISC. Face recognition is
one example. If your pattern is recognized, access can be granted
to software or to a specific location. If this technology was
incorporated into a video camera at your front door, your house
could actually unlock automatically and the front door open as
you approached.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Real-time monitoring is another area well
suited to ZISC chips. In France, a system is being used to count
the number of people that go through a particular area each day.
Since the system can continue to learn, it knows the difference
between a head and a backpack, for example.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At Lawrence Livermore Labs, ZISC is being
used to inspect the optics of large laser systems. Each time the
laser is fired, the optics are checked for cracks and other
defects. Depending on what is found, the system decides if it is
safe to fire the laser again. In applications like this,
secondary processing is used once a &quot;match&quot; is made
through ZISC. Perhaps the defect will allow the laser to be fired
once more, or twice. That response depends on the location of the
match.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As technology advances, ZISC chips are
expected to hold more cells and work even faster for less money.
The current generation ZISC36 chip was developed using 1 micron
technology at IBM. Work is being done to improve the density of
the chips and Silicon Recognition is hopeful that up to 200 cells
may be able to exist in a future version. Today&#146;s ZISC chip
operates at 20 MHz and can determine a match among 10,000
patterns in less than 3 microseconds. The next generation may
operate at up to 100 MHz for a significant speed increase.
Current Silicon Recognition products start at approximately $1000
for a board with a single ZISC chip. The company hopes to halve
that number by the end of this year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">From CISC to RISC and now to ZISC. Zero has
never been such a significant number.</font></p>
