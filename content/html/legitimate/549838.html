<P>Notes for MARY ANN CREED:  First child, Norman, was born out-of-wedlock.  She is listed as</P>

<P>Creed and Mary Jameson&quot;.  Married by T. J. McNichol, Pr., at 6 Allen Street, Boston.  </P>
<P>Speculation is that she fell out of favor with her true father, William, (who was married to Mary</P>
<P>Jamieson), and listed her uncle, John (who was married to Jane Jamieson, Mary's sister), as her</P>
<P>father.  Her death certificate correctly lists her father as William.</P>
<P></P>

<P>Henry Wispalare, was a drummer boy in the Civil War.  Their marriage certificate lists him at age</P>
<P>52, born in Belgium, and a &quot;widower&quot; at the time of this marriage.</P>
