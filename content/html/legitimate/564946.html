    </div>

      <div id="main_body">
        <p> &quot;Today, literacy and reading promotion are hot topics,&quot; said
          Center for the Book Director John Y. Cole on March 17 in welcoming
          participants to the center's annual &quot;idea exchange&quot; for its
        national reading promotion partners. </p>
        <p><img src="images/cfb_1.jpg" alt="Dr. Billington, Jonathan Key (The Enterprise Mountaineer, Waynesville, N.C.) and Rep. Charles H. Taylor (R-N.C.)" width="440" height="216" border="0" class="reg" /></p>

  subcommittee on Legislative Branch Appropriations, at the April 13 National
  Newspaper Association's congressional luncheon, which was hosted by the Center
  for the Book on April 13. <span>- <em>Jim Higgins</em></span></p>
        <p>&quot;The Center for the Book has been in the business since 1977,
          and I cannot recall a more active or upbeat time. I especially want
          to thank those organizations that were part of this partnership network
          when it started in 1987 and have stayed with us. I also offer a special
          welcome to the many new organizations that have joined us in recent
          years and are here today to share their best ideas and to find new
          project partners.&quot; </p>
        <p>Forty educational and civic organizations sent representatives to
          the meeting in the Library's Mumford Room, which was decorated with
          reading promotion posters and filled with descriptive literature about
        projects sponsored by reading promotion partners. </p>
        <p>In her remarks, Center for the Book Program Officer Maurvene D. Williams
          described the center's expanding Web site <a href="//www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook">www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook</a> and
          its increasing importance to all of the Center for the Book's activities.
          In addition to descriptions about the center's projects and publications,
          it includes information and links to more than 300 organizations in
          the United States and around the world that promote books, reading,
          literacy and libraries. The list includes universities and scholarly
          institutions concerned with book and library history. Ms. Williams
          cited statistics about the Web site's steadily increasing use: in February
          2000, for example, 23,030 transactions were handled by the center's
          site, compared to 21,172 in February 1999. </p>

        <p>Anne Boni, the center's program specialist in charge of the reading
          promotion partners network, presented an overview of current Center
          for the Book activities, briefly mentioning the following projects:
          Building a Nation of Readers, the national reading promotion theme
          for 1997-2000, Letters About Literature, River of Words and the Viburnum
          Foundation Family Literacy Project. She also discussed two Library
          of Congress Bicentennial projects/themes that the Center for the Book
          will carry into the new century through its reading promotion and affiliated
          state center partnership networks: Favorite Poem, and &quot;Beyond
          Words: Celebrating America's Libraries,&quot; which will be cosponsored
          with the American Library Association. She stressedthat these projects
        offer many opportunities for continuing and future partnerships. </p>
        <p>The meeting featured brief presentations from every organization present,
          plus several special presentations introduced by moderator John Cole.
          Holly O'Donnell of the U.S. Department of Education started with a
          description of the America Reads Challenge. This project, an effort
          to increase the reading proficiency among America's youth, aims &quot;to
          have all children reading well and independently by the end of the
          third grade.&quot; The Center for the Book assisted in organizing America
          Reads in 1996 and has supported its expansion in subsequent years.
          The presentations continued through lunch, concluding with a statement
          from Vera Hunter of the Church and Synagogue Library Association. </p>
        <p>Educator Louisa C. Moats, coauthor of <em>Straight Talk About Reading:
            How Parents Can Make a Difference During the Early Years</em> (1999),
            made a special presentation about &quot;tips for reading tutors.&quot; Drawing
            on current research about reading instruction, she emphasized the
            importance of printed matter to acquiring vocabulary. Ms. Moats also
            is the author of <em>Teaching Reading IS Rocket Science</em> (1999),
            a booklet prepared for the American Federation of Teachers, a Center
            for the Book partner. </p>

        <p>Mary Haggerty of the Boston television station WGBH gave a special
          video presentation about &quot;Between the Lions,&quot; the new PBS
          daily program that helps kids learn to read. Set in a library and aimed
          at children between the ages of 4 and 7 and their families, the series
          combines innovative puppetry, animation, live action and music into
          an entertaining learning adventure. It is co-produced by WGBH Boston
          and Sirius Thinking Ltd., and funded in part by a grant from the Education
        Department through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</p>
        <p>Since 1996 the Center for the Book and several of its reading promotion
          partners have been advising the developers of &quot;Between the Lions,&quot; particularly
          about how the series can be introduced to families, literacy professionals,
          educators and librarians. Mary Haggerty announced that the center and
          the other 14 &quot;founding partners&quot; would be included in forthcoming
          national advertising for the series in national newsmagazines and in <em>The
        New York Times</em>.</p>
       
        <p> Virginia Mathews, the center's consultant for the Viburnum Foundation/Center
          for the Book Family Literacy project, concluded the day with a plea
          for including libraries in reading promotion and literacy projects.
          She also called for &quot;full-flowered literacy,&quot; by which she
          meant exposing children as early as possible not only to books but
        also to the idea that books are part of every aspect of life. </p>
