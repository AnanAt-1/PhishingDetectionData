							<p>We usually think 
								  of Isis as an Egyptian goddess, but she was also worshipped by the Greeks 
								  after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt. When the Romans conquered 
								  both Egypt and Greece itself, the worship of Isis spread throughout 
								  the Roman Empire. She was venerated as a loving mother goddess who promoted 
								  fertility, oversaw the changing of the seasons, and healed the sick. 
								  She was also the patron of sailors. There were temples dedicated to 
								  Isis and her brother/husband Osiris throughout the Greco-Roman world. 
								  These temples were the sites of elaborate daily and annual rituals and 
								  were administered by an educated priesthood skilled in music and medicine. 
								  Isis worship was especially popular with women and with the new elite 
								  who gained wealth and prominence as the Roman empire expanded.</p>
								  <br>
								 <p> The Temple of Isis in 
								  Pompeii was small but ornate. It was destroyed in an earthquake in A.D. 
								  62 but was rebuilt shortly after that. The renovation was financed by 
								  a freed slave in the name of his young son. There may have been political 
								  motivations for this since freed slaves were not allowed to hold public 
								  office, and the son who was appointed as a member of the city council 
								  was only six years old. The Temple has a mixture of Egyptian, Greek, 
								  and Roman architectural features. This is not surprising since Roman 
								  architecture of this period was very ornate, often used bright colors, 
								  and borrowed and mixed styles from many eras. There were many statues 
								  in the Temple of Isis and the portico walls were covered with elaborate 
								  murals. To the left of the temple was a small roofless structure containing 
								  a tank that may have held the sacred water from the Nile, which was 
								  very important in many Isis ceremonies. In the rear of the sanctuary 
								  was a room containing a marble table where sacred meals were probably 
								  served. </p>
