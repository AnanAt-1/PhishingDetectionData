<h2 class="style24">Introduction </h2>
<p class="style24"> They called  them the &ldquo;Sons of the Pioneers,&rdquo; punning on the name of the country-western group   prominent during the thirties and forties.&nbsp; Sons of the Hollywood pioneers, that is:  young men who grew up on the orange tree-lined streets of Los Angeles as their  fathers (and occasionally mothers) laid the groundwork of the motion picture  industry.&nbsp; Acclimated to the movie  business from childhood, many of them naturally followed their parents into  it.&nbsp; Budd Schulberg was probably the  most famous of them, not because he won an Oscar for <em>On the Waterfront</em> or because his father was the deposed head of  Paramount in the twenties, but because his first writing effort of note, the  novel <em>What Makes Sammy Run?</em>, was a  gossipy expose of Hollywood venality whose characters were thinly disguised  takes on real-life figures from the thirties studio community.</p>
<p class="style24">Mostly in  their twenties when television arrived, these men often spent their careers  working behind the small screen.&nbsp; It was  their chance to make up an entertainment medium as they went along, just as  their fathers had done.&nbsp; Christopher  Knopf, son of the MGM producer Edwin Knopf, became an award-winning writer for <em>The Dick Powell Show</em> and <em>Cimarron Strip</em>.&nbsp; John Meredyth Lucas, son of writer Bess  Meredyth and stepson of <em>Casablanca</em> director Michael Curtiz, produced <em>Ben  Casey</em> and <em>Star Trek</em>.&nbsp; <em>Harry  O</em> producer Robert Dozier, son of William Dozier, was television&rsquo;s  equivalent of Schulberg, coming to prominence with a <em>Climax</em> teleplay about his tempestuous relationship with his father.</p>
<p class="style24">All of this  is by way of noting that when the writer Don M. Mankiewicz&rsquo;s name appears on a  television screen, the knowledgeable viewer is likely to wonder if he is  related to Herman Mankiewicz, the legendary screenwriter of <em>Citizen Kane</em>.&nbsp; Or Joseph Mankiewicz, the famously literate writer-director of <em>All About Eve</em> and <em>A Letter to Three Wives</em>.&nbsp; In  both cases the answer is yes: Don is the son of Herman, the nephew of  Joseph.&nbsp; His younger cousins, Joseph&rsquo;s  children, have also had noteworthy careers in the industry: Chris Mankiewicz as  a producer, Tom Mankiewicz as a screenwriter (of several James Bond films) and  story consultant (on <em>Hart to Hart</em>),  and Ben Mankiewicz as a host on the Turner Classic Movies channel.</p>
<p class="style24">Amid that  dynasty, Don Mankiewicz remains a surprisingly little-known figure, a resource  underutilized by historians and, more to the point, a talented writer who wielded a distinctive voice.&nbsp; Beginning  as a live TV dramatist, Mankiewicz specialized in stories about the rituals of  law and politics, subjects of such great interest to him that for a time he  maintained a parallel career as a public servant.&nbsp; Mankiewicz liked to craft scripts for shows like <em>On Trial</em> and <em>Armstrong Circle Theatre</em> out of stranger-than-fiction incidents  from the back pages of the newspaper, or by turning his imagination toward the  ramifications of some arcane point of law.&nbsp;  His work possessed a specificity and an attention to detail rare in  the early days of television.&nbsp; It was  natural that producer John Newland, in focusing his anthology of the paranormal <em>One Step Beyond</em> on documented  incidents, would recruit Mankiewicz as one of that show&rsquo;s primary writers.</p>
<p class="style24">Mankiewicz had a gift for rich dialogue as well.&nbsp; 
  John Frankenheimer, who directed  Mankiewicz&rsquo;s television adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&rsquo;s unfinished novel <em>The Great Tycoon</em>, remembered decades  later that, &ldquo;some of the best dialogue in that show is not Fitzgerald, it&rsquo;s Don  Mankiewicz.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>&nbsp; Above all, Mankiewicz  possessed a skill for getting to the heart of the matter, a way of conveying  complex emotional or intellectual shifts in his characters through spare,  precise lines.</p>
<p class="style24">In this scene from his <em>Marcus Welby</em> script &ldquo;Go Get &rsquo;Em Tiger,&rdquo;  for instance, Dr. Welby scolds his younger colleague for what he sees as a  lapse in judgment:</p>
<blockquote class="style24">
  <p>KILEY: I had to help him, even if it meant sticking my neck  out.&nbsp; Understand?<strong><br />
  </strong>WELBY: I might, if it had helped him, but it didn&rsquo;t &ndash; that&rsquo;s  the point.<br />
    KILEY: Well, I didn&rsquo;t break any law.<br />
    WELBY: Law?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m  talking about the greatest medical crime of all: stupidity.&nbsp; Double-dyed, compound stupidity.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you know they&rsquo;d check the man&rsquo;s  record?<br />
    KILEY: I didn&rsquo;t think about it.<br />
    WELBY: You didn&rsquo;t want to think about it.<br />
    KILEY: There&rsquo;s a question of a confidential relationship  between doctor and patient.<br />
    WELBY: Oh, baloney.&nbsp;  As we used to say in the olden days.&nbsp;  If there&rsquo;s anything more pitiful than a lawyer practicing medicine, it&rsquo;s  a doctor practicing law.&nbsp; That exam was  paid for by the school, and it was your job to record any material &ndash; <br />
    KILEY: I don&rsquo;t believe a man&rsquo;s former addiction is material.<br />
    WELBY: Stop it!&nbsp; Stop  the defenses and the technicalities.&nbsp; Now  look at what&rsquo;s happened.&nbsp; Chambers  doesn&rsquo;t have a job, and Howe wants your head on a pike.&nbsp; And he may get it.&nbsp; Now, why didn&rsquo;t you talk to me about this in the first  place?&nbsp; Why all the secrecy?<br />
    KILEY: I didn&rsquo;t think it was fair.&nbsp; It was my problem.<br />
    WELBY: And you knew in your heart that what you were doing  wouldn&rsquo;t work, and it was wrong besides.&nbsp;  But you didn&rsquo;t want to ask me, because you knew I&rsquo;d tell you exactly  that.&nbsp; You were wrong, Steve.&nbsp; Dead wrong.&nbsp;  Admit it.&nbsp; No excuses, no  defenses, no evasions, no if ands or buts.&nbsp;  You were wrong.&nbsp; Weren&rsquo;t you?<br />
    KILEY: Yes.&nbsp; I was  wrong.&nbsp; What I did, how I did it &ndash; all  wrong.<br />
    WELBY: Now that you&rsquo;ve admitted your mistake, let&rsquo;s you and  I try to figure out how to correct it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style24">Kiley&rsquo;s  decision to help a school bus driver who is recovering from heroin addiction  (Jack Albertson) by  omitting his drug use from a medical report earns the audience&rsquo;s sympathy, but  Mankiewicz insists on the point that Kiley&rsquo;s good intentions do not excuse a  greater social responsibility.&nbsp; Shrewdly  ascribing this less popular point of view to a character (Welby) who was  already established as a voice of tough wisdom, Mankiewicz makes his case as neatly  as a mathematician executing a proof.</p>
<p class="style24"><img src="../images/Marcus Welby Go Get Em Tiger.jpg" alt="Don Mankiewicz Marcus Welby &quot;Go Get Em Tiger&quot;" width="600" height="430" /><em><br />

<p class="style24">The most  visible writing of Mankiewicz&rsquo;s New York period was for <em>Profiles in Courage</em>,  the ambitious historical anthology based on John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s bestselling  book.&nbsp; (Initially dumped in the Sunday  afternoon ghetto of little-seen cultural programming, <em>Profiles</em> had a long afterlife in public schools&rsquo; sixteen-millimeter  libraries of educational films.)&nbsp;  Mankiewicz&rsquo; take on the Kennedy book was narrow and typically  incisive.&nbsp; Concerned that the show could  devolve into an array of simplistic stories of achievement culled from the  lives of great men, Mankiewicz wrote instead about individuals who had  sacrificed their reputations or careers to defend an unpopular stance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thomas Corwin&rdquo; was a senator who opposed  President Polk&rsquo;s declaration of the Mexican War; Georgia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Governor John M.  Slaton&rdquo; defied violent anti-semitism to pardon Leo Frank, a man convicted  unjustly in an infamous murder case.&nbsp; In  his look at &ldquo;Frederick Douglass,&rdquo; Mankiewicz focused on the famous abolitionist&rsquo;s  decision to risk his own liberty (he was a fugitive slave who could be legally  returned to bondage in the South) in order to speak out against slavery.</p>
<p class="style24">Mankiewicz&rsquo;s  most unusual <em>Profile</em> was a segment  that appeared to contradict his distaste for simple, uplifting tales.&nbsp; &ldquo;Judge Ben B. Lindsey&rdquo; examined a  turn-of-the-century Denver judge who helped to establish juvenile courts and  fought to outlaw child labor.&nbsp; The first  half of Mankiewicz&rsquo;s script portrays Lindsey (a terrific George Grizzard) as an  earnest do-gooder angered by minimum sentencing laws which require him to  punish children who steal coal to warm their homes as hardened criminals.&nbsp; Lindsey enlists the aid of an unexpectedly  compassionate railroad baron (David Brian, perfectly cast) to establish work  programs that will curb juvenile delinquency.&nbsp;  But just when Judge Lindsey starts to look like a Disney-styled hero &ndash; a  band of picturesque urchins follows him through the streets at one point &ndash;  Mankiewicz plunges the viewer into reality.&nbsp;  Lindsey, flush with victory, announces that he will take on illegal  gambling dens next.&nbsp; The railroad  magnate&rsquo;s face hardens.&nbsp; He orders  Lindsey to quit while he&rsquo;s ahead.&nbsp;  Lindsey realizes that big business has used him to make small,  cost-efficient social gains that look good in the press, but that when he  threatens serious capital, the political-industrial machine shuts him  down.&nbsp; Lindsey tries to outmaneuver his  opponents by pressuring the police to raid known gambling dens.&nbsp; In the raids, one of the boys Lindsey helped  to divert from prison is killed.</p>
<p class="style24">Subtly,  Mankiewicz questions the hubris of his protagonist.&nbsp; He offers the sophisticated argument that judicial activism &ndash;  Lindsey&rsquo;s willingness to interpret the law counter to its obvious intent in  order to achieve the result he desires &ndash; will have dire consequences no matter  how honorable its intent.&nbsp; And, of  course, Mankiewicz&rsquo;s cynical script indicts the institutionalized corruption  that Lindsey encounters, suggesting that it is an inescapable byproduct of any  capitalist society in which financial profit is cherished above anything else.</p>
<p class="style24">By the time <em>Profiles in Courage</em> ceased  production, so had most of the other gritty New York dramas that were keeping  live television&rsquo;s last holdouts afloat on the east coast.&nbsp; In 1966, Mankiewicz moved to Hollywood and  quickly established a foothold in mainstream television, writing the telefilms  that served as pilots for both <em>Ironside</em> and <em>Marcus Welby, M.D.</em>&nbsp; By today&rsquo;s standards, Mankiewicz would  probably possess a sole or at least a shared &ldquo;created by&rdquo; credit on both series.&nbsp; Offered a chance to produce <em>Ironside</em>, Mankiewicz said no, opting not  to attach himself to a single series.&nbsp;  He continued to turn out episodic scripts and television movies,  eventually taking on his old college classmate, the novelist Gordon Cotler, as  a writing partner.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="style24">Though he  adapted to the generic requirements of detective and doctor shows, Mankiewicz  remained attentive to his earlier obsessions.&nbsp;  In &ldquo;Go Get &rsquo;Em, Tiger,&rdquo; the climax takes the form of a school board  meeting in which Welby, the board members, and the student body engage in a  socratic debate over the usefulness of former addicts in dissuading drug use  among the young.&nbsp; As he had done in his <em>Star Trek</em> episode, &ldquo;Court Martial,&rdquo;  which speculated on the nature of the legal process in the twenty-third century,  Mankiewicz bent <em>Marcus Welby</em>&rsquo;s format  toward a dialectic in which the possible resolutions of his scenario are  scrutinized and then accepted or rejected.
<p class="style24">If those  descriptions of his output make Mankiewicz sound like the driest sort of  intellectual, rest assured that other assignments brought out an earthier, more  playful side.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Leaf in the Forest&rdquo;  was a serial killer story with a lurid paperback flavor and a tricky twist  ending, and another of his <em>Ironside</em>s  took one of Mankiewicz&rsquo;s own favorite hangouts, the racetrack, for its  milieu.
<p class="style24">It was this  aspect of Mankiewicz, this cheerful enthusiasm for the seedy and the strange,  that I thought of when I met him for a long, late lunch at the venerable Canter&rsquo;s Deli  in West Hollywood.&nbsp; Maybe it was just  the stuck-in-the-seventies decor in the darkened, empty back room of Canter&rsquo;s,  but the laid-back Mankiewicz seemed much more the sort of character you&rsquo;d  expect to find at the track than in the committee meetings and union events  where he&rsquo;d spent much of his professional life.&nbsp; A droll raconteur, Mankiewicz encouraged a view of TV writing as  an easy way to make a comfortable living or, at least, a less colorful arena in  which to spend one&rsquo;s life than politics or law.&nbsp; Inevitably, our conversation strayed from Mankiewicz&rsquo;s own career  and into some fascinating tangents of Hollywood lore and political scandal.
<p class="style24">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="style24">The Interview</h1>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>When did you first  start writing?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">When I went into the army I was partway through law school &ndash;  as a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m still on military leave from Columbia law school &ndash; and  then I wrote a short story that I sent to the <em>New Yorker</em> and they bought it.&nbsp;  They paid me, I think, $175, and it took me about an hour to write  it.&nbsp; So I said, &ldquo;$175?&nbsp; Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d already noticed that my father seemed to live reasonably  well, seemed to have money, didn&rsquo;t fall down exhausted from doing any heavy  lifting.&nbsp; So I decided that&rsquo;s what I  would do.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Then I got a letter from a guy named Jack Schoenbrun, who  was an agent, offering to represent me.&nbsp;  He was a crook, as it turned out.&nbsp;  I wrote some kind of a piece for him that he sold to an Australian  magazine.&nbsp; That was about gambling, I  think.</p>
<p class="style24">I did radio.&nbsp; I did  gags for Robert Q. Lewis, who was a comedian at that time.&nbsp; He paid me $25 a page.&nbsp; If I typed pretty big and filled the page  pretty easily, I could make $50 a week there.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Were you living in New York during the live television  era?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Yes.&nbsp; I came out here  [to Los Angeles] for a while and got married, and then we went back to New  York.&nbsp; I lived in the city.&nbsp; I really don&rsquo;t know how I got into  television.&nbsp; Somebody must have  suggested it.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>In 1951 </em>Studio  One<em> adapted a short story of yours called &ldquo;The Man Who Had Influence.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Oh, did they buy that?&nbsp;  That was a <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> story, I think.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t adapt  it.&nbsp; I had completely forgotten that.</p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>The first credit of yours that I know about was on &ldquo;Never  Wave at a WAC,&rdquo; a </strong></em><strong>Schlitz Playhouse of Stars</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">All I remember is that it was set in a Catskills hotel and  the people were stealing [from the hotel], and I invented the notion that  [there was] some pretext for opening all the bags &ndash; that a jewel thief was  loose and that everybody&rsquo;s bag would have to be checked, so they didn&rsquo;t take  the towels.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t any jewel  thief.&nbsp; This is kind of slight to sustain  [for] an hour, but it worked.&nbsp; It was  not completely original, I don&rsquo;t think, and I forget who was in it.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Felix Jackson was the producer.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>&nbsp; He was a fairly well-known producer of  fluffy musicals.&nbsp; He was a friend of my  father&rsquo;s and maybe he called me and lured me into this, or maybe I saw  something in the paper about it.&nbsp; I used to sell myself more readily than I do  now.&nbsp; I got to be shy over the course of  the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Another thing that kind of impeded me is that I was a  politician all this time.&nbsp; I mean  organization: knock on the door, carry the petitions, raise the money, and all  that stuff.&nbsp; That started around 1948,  then we moved to Nassau County. We finally turned Nassau County Democratic, but  before we turned it Democratic I ran for the assembly in &rsquo;52 and I lost.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>You ran on the Democratic ticket?</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">Yeah, a Democrat and Liberal.&nbsp; And the Times thought it was kind of unusual that somebody with  any name at all would run in Nassau County, where the Democrats had not won  since Lincoln.&nbsp; We beat Lincoln, and we  used to say if he ran again we could beat him again. </p>
<p class="style24">In &rsquo;50, my brother Frank had run out here and he won his  primary, which was very unusual, for a Democrat to win the Democratic  primary.&nbsp; They had cross-filing in those  days.&nbsp; He was the first Democrat to get  on the ballot as a Democrat.&nbsp; Then, of  course, he lost.&nbsp; So I figured that  seemed like fun, so I tried it.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t  really want to run for the Assembly.&nbsp;  All I wanted to be was a committeeman, I wanted to run my district.&nbsp; I went to the county leader.&nbsp; He was really understanding what was going  on; he looked at his book and said, &ldquo;Well, we already have two committeemen in  your district.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re  supposed to have &ndash; one man and one woman.&nbsp;  So I can&rsquo;t make you a committeeman.&nbsp;  How about you run for the Assembly?&rdquo;&nbsp;  So I said, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I ran a fairly good race.&nbsp;  It was reasonably close.&nbsp; It was  close enough so that the bulldog papers did not concede it, and in the morning  the Times put out the story that said that I was swept away in the Eisenhower  landslide.&nbsp; So I called my father, who  had put up most of the money for this, although $500 was what it cost me to  run.&nbsp; That was a high price for an  Assembly [race] &ndash; for that I had a storefront, newspaper ads, and god knows  what all.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">So I read him the Times piece, and he said, &ldquo;Well, you know,  that election, Eisenhower won 52 to 48.&rdquo;&nbsp;  He said, &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t make landslides like they used to.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; Now today we read that Bush won in a landslide that was 51 to 49.</p>
<p class="style24">So that did take up a certain amount of my time.&nbsp; &rsquo;66 was the only time it stopped me [from  writing] completely.&nbsp; I ran statewide  for delegate at large to the state constitutional convention in New York, and I  won.&nbsp; That meant I had to be in Albany  for half a year.&nbsp; But except for that  there wasn&rsquo;t any great interference [by] politics.&nbsp; My brother would&rsquo;ve been a good lawyer, and he was a pretty good  writer.&nbsp; He wrote a couple of good  non-fiction books, but he also got distracted by politics, and now he does only  politics.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Did you really see a career for yourself in politics?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Yes, and I should have had it.&nbsp; I really wanted to be a congressman.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I decided when I was about fifteen.&nbsp; I reached the point in &rsquo;64 when I was  offered the nomination by the county leader for U.S. Congressman from the 3rd  Congressional District.&nbsp; That included  the North Shore of Long Island, which was fifty percent Democratic,  almost.&nbsp; I could not lose, because this  was Johnson against Goldwater; he was going to carry it two to one, which he  did.&nbsp; Then I had to turn it down because  I was getting a divorce from my wife, and she said that if I ran she would &ndash; I  knew that she knew I was not entirely faithful, but I didn&rsquo;t know that she was  making a book on it with detectives and all that stuff.&nbsp; She was going to give that to my opponent if  I ran, who was Steven Derounian, who was a fear artist.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the fellow from the picture <em>Quiz Show</em>, the one [on the Congressional  committee] that will not accept poor Charlie Van Doren&rsquo;s explanation [about his  participation in the rigging of quiz programs].&nbsp; Van Doren would have fooled the whole Congress but Derounian  says, no, this is just a liar trying to cover up his tracks.&nbsp; All the others were willing to accept that  Van Doren was sorry that it happened.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>That sounds like something out of Gore Vidal&rsquo;s </em>The Best Man<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Yes, it really was, it was that kind of a situation.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Did you also like to write about politics?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Yeah, I did a very good two-part [adaptation of] &ldquo;All the  King&rsquo;s Men&rdquo; for <em>Kraft</em>, with a  celebrated director, Sidney Lumet.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Live?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Yes.&nbsp; Neville Brand  [who played the Huey Long character] was a good actor, but what he&rsquo;s famous for  is that he was blacklisted at Universal.&nbsp;  He was a drunk and he pissed on a tour bus filled with tourists.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t work at Universal after that.</p>
<span class="style28">He must have been great as that Huey Long character.</span>
<p class="style24">He was.&nbsp; He was  superb.</p>
<p class="style24">What little technique I learned about adaptation was when I  did <em>Trial</em> with Charlie Schnee, who  was the producer.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;He was a  writer himself, in fact an Oscar winner, and he taught me how you do it.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t work any more, but he taught me  the technique that you&rsquo;d divide the play into sequences, and each sequence ends  with a dissolve.&nbsp; None of this is true  any more, but I used that . . . . That was really the only instruction I had;  the rest I just sort of found my own way.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>You wrote some other  adaptations of well-known modern works, like &ldquo;The Male Animal&rdquo; for </em>Kraft<em> and &ldquo;The Last Tycoon&rdquo; for </em>Playhouse 90<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">&ldquo;The Male Animal&rdquo; of course is based on a play by Thurber  and Nugent.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s based  on a real-life story or not, but we updated it.&nbsp; It was twenty years old by the time we did it, the play, and we  put it into the sixties or whatever time it was.&nbsp; This originally was the story of a professor who was threatened  because he permitted his English class to read the Sacco letter, or Vanzetti,  whichever one of them wrote the eloquent letter.&nbsp; Which in fact we know was not written by that fellow at all; I  think it was written by Heywood Broun.&nbsp;  But it did seem to me that it wasn&rsquo;t reasonable, the fact that anybody  would be disciplined for reading the Sacco letter in the sixties.&nbsp; So I asked my brother what we should  do.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;What you do is, just make  one change: Have this take place in a California college, and he be disciplined  for <em>not</em> letting his class read the Sacco letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which is true.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; then as an expression, but  that&rsquo;s what Frank was anticipating and he was absolutely right.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">The production of &ldquo;The Male Animal&rdquo; was a disaster.&nbsp; Everything went wrong there.&nbsp; In fact, there was a certain amount of ill  feeling.&nbsp; Bill Dozier was now a big  executive at CBS, and they were having difficulty casting the wife.&nbsp; I came to work one day, to the rehearsal,  and I said, &ldquo;Did you cast the wife yet?&rdquo;&nbsp;  They said, &ldquo;Yes, what do you think of Ann Rutherford?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s who we&rsquo;re using.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Well, Rutherford was wrong for the part, and she was also  Dozier&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; The only thing I could think  of was a British music hall routine where two guys come out and hit each other  with bladders, and one says, &ldquo;Oy, I&rsquo;ve got a riddle for you, Joey: Two guys  apply for a job at the colliery and one of them&rsquo;s had extensive experience in  actual mining, and the other&rsquo;s a student of mining and a graduate of  Oxford.&nbsp; Which one gets the job?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the other guy says, &ldquo;Oy don&rsquo;t know, who  does get the job, Bertie?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bertie says,  &ldquo;Gaitskill&rsquo;s bloody nephew, that&rsquo;s who gets the job.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gaitskill being the minister of agriculture or whatever he  was.&nbsp; And unfortunately when I said this  I could see the producer signaling me to shut up, because Dozier was standing  right behind me.&nbsp; And that caused a  certain stir at the time.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Rutherford was all right, actually.&nbsp; It was that we just had bad luck.&nbsp; At the opening of it, Andy Griffith, who  plays the professor, he&rsquo;s suddenly remembered his wife&rsquo;s birthday and he&rsquo;s at  the door with flowers and she comes and answers the door.&nbsp; She opens the door, the light falls on the  flowers, and all the petals drop off [due to the intense heat].&nbsp; In full view of the audience.&nbsp; I guess we didn&rsquo;t have the lighting set up  before that.&nbsp; [The dress rehearsal was]  without the lighting, maybe.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And everything went wrong from there on in.&nbsp; I ran into Andy Griffith about ten years  later in the parking lot of a market in East Norwich, Long Island, where I was  living.&nbsp; He was sitting in a  convertible, and I went over and said, &ldquo;Andy, it&rsquo;s been a long time since we&rsquo;ve  met.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">&ldquo;It has indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I said, &ldquo;What have you been doing all that time?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">He said, &ldquo;Hidin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">That was, I think, the only one that really was a disaster.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>How involved were you,  as the writer, in the production of your live teleplays?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Well, one you thing you had to do, at least on the good  ones, <em>Playhouse 90</em> and <em>Kraft</em> and <em>Philco</em>, you were there through the rehearsals so that what didn&rsquo;t  work you could change right there.&nbsp; You  [could] figure out if it was impossible to make the costume change in time for  the second scene, so you&rsquo;d have to rewrite it and put somebody else in the  second scene or do something.&nbsp; You could  determine experimentally if what you had written worked.&nbsp; The director would tell you, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do  this.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I had good directors.&nbsp;  John Frankenheimer did &ldquo;The Last Tycoon.&rdquo;&nbsp; A good <em>Last Tycoon</em>, I  thought.&nbsp; It was the only <em>Last Tycoon</em> I&rsquo;ve ever known that did it  as an incomplete story, which it is, because Fitzgerald died before he finished  it.&nbsp; It just ended.&nbsp; There are some notes that Fitzgerald did on  how he wanted it to end, but he was pretty far gone, I think, by then, and they  don&rsquo;t make any sense.&nbsp; Most people carry  the story on beyond the point where Fitzgerald took it.&nbsp; He just arbitrarily ended it on a shot of  the half-eaten hamburger which is left on the beach, and they have gone into  the beach house.&nbsp; [The TV version] was  very well reviewed, but now nobody knows it and nobody thinks that that&rsquo;s the  construction to be used.&nbsp; But I think it  still is.</p>
<p class="style24">My Monroe Stahr was a great mistake.&nbsp; It was Jack Palance. &nbsp;It was the only thing that screwed us  up.&nbsp; Jack Palance is a good actor, but  he can&rsquo;t play a Jew.&nbsp; But everyone else  was fine.&nbsp; That was Lee Remick&rsquo;s first  television [appearance], and she, oddly enough, was able to tell me something I  didn&rsquo;t know, which was that the character of Cecilia was actually modeled on  Budd Schulberg.&nbsp; Of course, if you think  about it, it had to be.&nbsp; He was the  producer&rsquo;s son; it had just been changed [by Fitzgerald] to the producer&rsquo;s  daughter.&nbsp; And how she found that out  was she had just finished working with Budd Schulberg on <em>A Face in the Crowd</em>.</p>
<span class="style28">Del Reisman, the story editor for </span><span class="style29">Playhouse 90</span><span class="style28">, told me that he tried to match up writers with  story material that was uniquely suited to them, and this seems like a classic  instance of that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m guessing he can  take credit for hiring you to write that particular teleplay because you grew  up around the movie business during the time Fitzgerald wrote </span><span class="style29">The Last Tycoon</span><span class="style28">.</span>
<p class="style24">Yes, I think so.&nbsp; I  did know a little bit about [that period in Hollywood history].&nbsp; I was probably the only writer around who  had actually seen Fitzgerald in person.&nbsp;  I never talked to him, but he hung around with my father a little bit.&nbsp; I remember seeing him when I was a kid,  really, and all I remembered is he wore a white sweater that had the 1932  Olympic emblem on it.&nbsp; Maybe that was in  1932, or maybe he just wore it for a long time.&nbsp; But I saw what went on in the movie business.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Did you grow up in Los Angeles?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Yes, from the age of four on until I graduated from high school.&nbsp; Then I went to Columbia, but I spent the  summers out here.&nbsp; </p>
<span class="style28">It dovetails with your interest in politics, of course,  but I would say that the primary theme I see running through your work is the  use of true or historical material for your stories.</span>
<p class="style24">To some extent, certainly.&nbsp;  For <em>Schlitz Playhouse of Stars</em> I did an incredible story which was true, but it didn&rsquo;t sound true, even when  we did it.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t sound true when it  was brought to me, although I know it&rsquo;s the truth, and there was no way to make  it sound like it was.&nbsp; This was [about]  a young fellow seeking the Republican nomination for the assembly in the  district of Queens, or Brooklyn, who somehow was approached by the Russians,  who then gave him a little bit of money to finance his campaign.&nbsp; He met with them every day on how he&rsquo;s going  to give up state secrets after he gets elected.&nbsp; These Russians are out of their goddamn minds &ndash; first of all, an  assemblyman is not going to learn any state secrets.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re confused.&nbsp; Maybe  in Russia &ldquo;state&rdquo; means something else, it means the country.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t understand that.&nbsp; They thought New York was an independent  state, like Uzbekistan or one of those Russian states.&nbsp; But also, of course, he was running for the  Republican nomination in a district that the Democrats could never carry,  haven&rsquo;t carried to this day.&nbsp; And he  played along with them and involved the F.B.I.&nbsp;  It was an interesting enough story, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe that the  Russians did that . . . . It was named after the guy&rsquo;s name; he had an odd  name.&nbsp; It sounded like a comedy and it  wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p class="style24">I did a great spy story that nobody seems to have told  properly.&nbsp; Colonel [Rudolf] Abel was the  greatest Russian spy that ever was, I think.&nbsp;  What he did was he moved into New York, I guess in the forties, during  the Cold War.&nbsp; He rented an apartment or  a hotel room or something close to the Federal Building, and he ran a  half-dozen spies who were his subordinates.&nbsp;  He summoned them by putting a thumbtack into the big &ldquo;no&rdquo; sign in  Central park, that said &ldquo;No ball playing, no bike riding, no hunting, no this,  no that.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to where he put it,  that said where the meeting was.&nbsp; Also  he had his radio sender and radio receiver hooked up and stretched around a  wire out the window over to the Federal Building, and he&rsquo;s using federal  power!&nbsp; This is what he&rsquo;s going to send  stuff to Moscow with, if he ever gets anything.&nbsp; Of course he doesn&rsquo;t get anything, because there isn&rsquo;t anything  to be had and never was in any of these [cases].&nbsp; Nobody ever really got a secret.&nbsp;  The secrets in espionage are always the names of the other agents.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you sell: you sell out all your  undercover agents in Berlin or all the ones in Prague or something.&nbsp; But are they getting any information from  any of these people?&nbsp; If you stop them,  what are you stopping?&nbsp; Nobody knows  what you&rsquo;re stopping.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Then the Russians, incredibly, assigned an assistant to Abel  named [Reino] Hayhanen, and the reason they assigned him to New York was  because he was so drunk, perpetually drunk, that they wouldn&rsquo;t trust him in  Paris.&nbsp; They sent him to Abel, and he  was very useless to Abel, but one day &ndash; Abel&rsquo;s prize possession was a nickel  which he had managed somehow to slice, insert a big hole in, and then screw  back together, so that if he ever did get something he could microfilm it and  that nickel could then be carried to Moscow and nobody would notice.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">He left the nickel on his desk and Hayhanen, going to lunch,  picked up the nickel and bought a Journal-American from a newsstand right in  front of the Federal Building.&nbsp; And this  nickel, apparently because of what Abel had done to it, didn&rsquo;t feel right to  the newsdealer.&nbsp; I always said a blind  newsdealer, but I&rsquo;m not sure that that&rsquo;s really true.&nbsp; He threw it on the ground, and it split open in front of an FBI  man who was coming out of the FBI office, who immediately grabbed Hayhanen, who  gave up Abel in a split second, and Abel went to prison.&nbsp; They wanted to execute Abel but a Democratic  politician went and defended Abel against the death penalty, and beat the  rap.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Abel is the one who ultimately was exchanged for Francis  Gary Powers, the guy who screwed up the U-2.&nbsp;  And my lawyer, James Britt Donovan, did that exchange!&nbsp; He carried him over.&nbsp; It was one of those things where they met on  the bridge, and he walked out there with Abel and then walked back with Francis  Gary Powers.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Francis Gary Powers, of course, eventually became a weather  helicopter operator here in Los Angeles, and died when he forgot to put gas in  his helicopter and it crashed.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Did you actually turn  that idea into a script?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">I don&rsquo;t think I wrote the end of it.&nbsp; I proposed it, but I don&rsquo;t think I actually  wrote it . . . . We had a series called <em>On  Trial</em>, and I think I dramatized the lawyer who [defended Abel].&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em>On Trial</em>, in my  opinion, was the first of the [great courtroom dramas].&nbsp; It antedated <em>The Defenders</em> considerably, and it was going to do important points  of law.&nbsp; We did start out with some  important points of law, such as unfair competition and criminal libel, things  that people really don&rsquo;t know anything about.&nbsp;  Then NBC told us that the only point of law that they were interested in  was the law against killing: you&rsquo;re not supposed to murder.&nbsp; So we did only murder stories after  that.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">But they got a couple of seasons out of that, I think.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t call it <em>On Trial</em> after a while &ndash; they changed the name to <em>The Joseph Cotten Show</em>.&nbsp; Jo Cotten was a running lawyer; he was in  modern clothes, even in the old courtroom.&nbsp;  He was always the commentator.</p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>So you were a regular contributor to the </strong></em><strong>On  Trial</strong><em><strong> series?</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">Yes.&nbsp; As a matter of  fact, how I got involved with it, I proposed that show in the first place at  the behest of the American Bar Association, and they didn&rsquo;t want it.&nbsp; Then I submitted it to some advertising  agency, which you did in those days, and they didn&rsquo;t want it either.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And then I read that Collie Young &ndash; Collier Young was a  literary agent and also a good writer and independent producer &ndash; [had a similar  project] that he and Ida Lupino were going to do together.&nbsp; Exactly my idea &ndash; not only my idea, but they  were dramatizing the same obscure case that I had selected in my  presentation.&nbsp; It was Holmes against the  United States, which was a guy who was in charge of a lifeboat that was  overloaded in a storm, and he . . . selected who was to be thrown over the side  of the lifeboat.&nbsp; They threw all of the  men over, except those who were [married]: do not separate man and wife, he  said.&nbsp; So they threw over all the single  men, maybe half a dozen single men.&nbsp; The  crime that was involved in that was that the next morning they discovered a  single man who&rsquo;d been hiding in the bottom of the lifeboat, and as an exercise  of absolute fairness they had to throw him over the side too, which they  did.&nbsp; Then Holmes was tried for all  this, for murder, in Philadelphia and he beat the rap.&nbsp; It was a very nice case.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">When I found out that Collie Young and the Filmakers  Company, which was him and Ida, was going to do this, I found a lawyer who  would sue them on speculation and we sued them for several million dollars,  which in those days was quite a [lot]; now, today, of course, that&rsquo;s the  minimum; you can&rsquo;t do it for less.&nbsp; We  wound up amalgamating the two projects.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Collie and I became friends, and were friends until his  death after that.&nbsp; In fact, it was  because of that that we did <em>On Trial</em>,  we did a spook show called <em>One Step  Beyond</em>, which incredibly enough up until a year or so ago I used to see [on  television] at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, these primitive half-hour episodes  that we made for about forty thousand dollars with name actors.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t have anything else, just  actors.&nbsp; We took whatever sets there  were.&nbsp; But he also produced that, and  then he produced <em>Ironside</em>.&nbsp; I wrote that pilot.&nbsp; We had a good relationship.</p>
<p align="center" class="style24">*</p>
<p class="style24"><strong>Profiles in Courage<em> also told  docudrama-type stories.&nbsp; It was based  on the best-seller ghost-written under President Kennedy&rsquo;s name, and vetted by  people on his staff.</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">Yes, I think I wrote six of them.&nbsp; They were quite accurate.&nbsp;  Ted Sorensen had to look at them, and he had to say, not that they were  necessarily [factual], but that it could have been that way.&nbsp; He was the one, Sorensen, that said we had  to have a scene to demonstrate that each person, each of these profiles in  courage, gave up important careers on a point of courage.&nbsp; Like the fellow who cast the deciding vote  against the impeachment of Andrew Johnson: people who have thrown their lives  away in support of an act of courage.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">We were supposed to do twenty-four of them.&nbsp; Well, there aren&rsquo;t twenty-four [people] in  American history that meet that standard, nowhere near that.&nbsp; Now we wound up doing profiles.&nbsp; Bob Saudek said, &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re  doing profiles of people against whom no act of cowardice could be proven.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And we did.&nbsp; What was  Ben Lindsey&rsquo;s great act of courage?&nbsp; He  founded the children&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; Well,  that&rsquo;s not a great act of courage but we tricked it up so that it became a  great act.&nbsp; On the other hand, Black Tom  Corwin was a senator who voted against the appropriations for the Mexican War,  even [against] bandages and medicine for the soldiers.&nbsp; <em>That</em> took courage.&nbsp; When they told him, &ldquo;Well, what are you  doing that for, you&rsquo;re only one senator,&rdquo;&nbsp;  he&rsquo;s the one who said, &ldquo;Well, I have only one vote, and when I cast it I  have to cast it as if I were casting the vote of the entire senate.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he destroyed his political career with  that one vote.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I&rsquo;m trying to think of what the others were we did.&nbsp; Some of them were quite courageous &ndash; the guy  who refused to execute the Mormons, General Doniphan.&nbsp; That was an act of genuine courage.&nbsp; He was the first person to say that when he took his oath to obey  the orders of officers appointed over him, that meant <em>legal</em> orders.&nbsp; What his order was was to shoot the rebels,  the Mormons, in the far west, in Nebraska.&nbsp;  Well, the far west was their own headquarters; when they were able to  penetrate that headquarters, the war was over.&nbsp;  These were prisoners of war and he wouldn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; And he got away with that.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the other thing, you could do  profiles of people who got away with something.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>You also did one on Frederick Douglass.</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">Yes.&nbsp; I think he was  persistent rather than courageous.&nbsp; Yes,  he did make speeches which exposed his own past and could conceivably have  resulted in his being sent back to Baltimore to the fellow that owned him.&nbsp; But that never happened.</p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>Did you choose the historical figures you wrote about?</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">I think we had a group of them, and I think I was permitted  to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style24"><img src="../images/Profiles in Courage Mankiewicz.jpg" alt="Don M. Mankiewicz Profiles in Courage &quot;Governor John M. Slaton&quot;" width="455" height="600" /><em><br />
&ldquo;Governor John M. Slaton,&rdquo; with Walter Matthau in the title role and Betsy Jones-Moreland, was one of Mankiewicz&rsquo;s </em>Profiles in Courage<em> segments that was not derived from President Kennedy&rsquo;s book.</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>You wrote an episode of </strong></em><strong>The  Trials of O&rsquo;Brien</strong><em><strong>, a great New York-based drama starring Peter Falk as a  schlubby but brilliant attorney.</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">Yes.&nbsp; <em>The Trials of O&rsquo;Brien</em> is really, of  course, <em>Columbo</em>.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t say so, but it&rsquo;s exactly the same  thing, the raincoat and the dog.&nbsp; The  only thing that made it not work is that, unlike Columbo, O&rsquo;Brien is  divorced.&nbsp; You could not have a divorced  hero at that time; it did not work.&nbsp; And  the interplay between him and the ex-wife was what provided the comedy that  kept the episodes going.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>And you wrote one script for </strong></em><strong>Star  Trek</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">Yes, a very early episode.&nbsp;  My mind was distracted with other things, and I didn&rsquo;t really finish  it.&nbsp; They said they&rsquo;d have somebody  finish it and they did; another fellow, Steven Carabatsos, finished it.&nbsp; If I had been there I would have yelled  about how they shot it.&nbsp; The only thing  I specified was that the heroine could not be blonde.&nbsp; They made her blonde.</p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>Why couldn&rsquo;t she be blonde?</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">It just was out of character.&nbsp; This had to be a square lawyer, and they made her a ditzy blonde  lawyer.&nbsp; And they changed a few other  things.&nbsp; But I liked the piece; I  thought he [Carabatsos] did a good job.</p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>In a biography of Gene Roddenberry, the author reprints a  memo in which Roddenberry wrote that your view of the future was too  &ldquo;pessimistic.&rdquo;</strong></em><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="style24">I didn&rsquo;t think it was pessimistic.&nbsp; What I did was, I took their view of the [future], which was that  everybody in this picture was electronic.&nbsp;  You did research by button, like you do today, to some extent; everybody  was hooked into Google.&nbsp; But this guy,  the lawyer, who was [played by] Elisha Cook, Jr., a very good actor, he was the  last person to have books.&nbsp; He looked  things up, he pulled things down from the shelf, and they didn&rsquo;t know what he  was doing.&nbsp; But he won the case.&nbsp; Yes, if you think that&rsquo;s a pessimistic view,  that there would then be only one person with books, I think that&rsquo;s what Roddenberry  meant.</p>
<p align="center" class="style24">*</p>
<span class="style28">Then we come to a new phase in your career, in which you  wrote the telefilm pilots for some long-running series at Universal.</span>
<p class="style24">Yes, <em>Ironside</em> and <em>Welby</em>, I did both of those for  Universal.&nbsp; I still lived in New  York.&nbsp; I did <em>Ironside</em> with Collie Young, and it worked.&nbsp; Then there was a producer named David Victor  at Universal, and I think he was impressed by the fact that <em>Ironside</em> worked, and he sought me out  somehow.&nbsp; He had been the producer of <em>Dr. Kildare</em>, and he wanted the same  thing again.&nbsp; He wanted a young radical  doctor and a conservative older doctor like they had in <em>Dr. Kildare</em>, and I must say I did solve that problem.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t want that.&nbsp; You want a <em>young</em> conservative and an <em>old</em> radical.&nbsp; Young fogie and old radical,  that&rsquo;ll work.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it did work.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>And that was </strong></em><strong>Marcus Welby</strong><em><strong>.&nbsp; Of course, today, you&rsquo;d probably have a  &ldquo;created by&rdquo; credit on both those shows.</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">I should have; I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;  I got diddled out of it.&nbsp; I  should have had that on <em>Ironside</em> and <em>Welby</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<span class="style28">You kept writing for </span><span class="style29">Ironside</span><span class="style28"> after the pilot.</span>
<p class="style24">A couple of them, yes.&nbsp;  I think wrote the first episode, which I called &ldquo;The Only Way to Beat  the Horse Is With a Stick,&rdquo; which I thought was a very good title.&nbsp; And they changed it to &ldquo;Message From  Beyond,&rdquo; a standard title.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">&ldquo;Why did you change that?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">They said, &ldquo;It just seemed easier.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I said, &ldquo;Sure, because you already had that title made up  [as an optical].&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t have to  shoot it again.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was an <em>Ironside</em> involved with a crime at a  racetrack.</p>
<span class="style28">There&rsquo;s that horse racing motif in your work again.</span>
<p class="style24">Yes, I liked that.&nbsp;  Well, my characters tend to go to the racetrack when they&rsquo;re not doing  [anything else].&nbsp; Even Dr. Welby went to  the racetrack.&nbsp; Only in one shot [in the  pilot].&nbsp; He went to the quarterhorses.</p>
<span class="style28">Horse racing isn&rsquo;t as popular today as it was then, it  seems.</span>
<p class="style24">Well, no.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t  think people go to the races any more.&nbsp;  You can follow it much better at home, and [if] you can maneuver the  buttons on your phone you can bet &rsquo;em at home, which I do.</p>
<span class="style28">Collier Young was in essence forced out of Ironside early on, but you continued writing  for the show under the new regime.</span>
<p class="style24">Well, they offered me a job as the producer, and in those  days you would actually have had to produce it.&nbsp; It was around the time I was running for delegate, in 1966.&nbsp; I had to miss a session on the floor of the  constitutional [convention] because I hadn&rsquo;t seen it [<em>Ironside</em>].&nbsp; I had to go  somewhere and find a television set and watch it.&nbsp; And a close vote was held that night!&nbsp; It was lost because I wasn&rsquo;t there, and the people who were  pushing the vote were furious.&nbsp; I  managed somehow to get another vote for them a couple days later, so that all  was smoothed out.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">That&rsquo;s probably why I would not have agreed to produce it,  because I was thinking too much of politics in those days.&nbsp; I regret that I didn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; I could have stayed on producing stuff  forever.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very easy.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I wanted to go back to New York.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>Around that time you also did a made-for-television film called </strong></em><strong>Who Has Seen the Wind</strong><em><strong>?</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">That was an interesting project.&nbsp; The U.N. wanted to make a series of expensive movies and they  wanted people to donate their services.&nbsp;  Joe, my uncle Joe, did one, the Christmas one &ndash; Dickens at Christmas.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>&nbsp; These were all cast with only stars, many  stars, a lot of money spent &ndash; but none for the writer.&nbsp; Joe volunteered his services and then  suggested that I might want to do one.&nbsp;  They talked to me and I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do one but I can&rsquo;t do it  voluntarily.&nbsp; I need the money.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they gave me $10,000.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">We had Gypsy Rose Lee, Edward G. Robinson, Stanley Baker,  four or five other really big names that you never saw on television until that  moment, doing it because it was for the U.N.&nbsp;  It dealt with what are called stateless mariners after the war. They  were people [who] got into a situation where they could never get off the ship,  went back and forth [between ports].&nbsp; I  assume they got off the ship by now.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">That&rsquo;s the other problem with many of these films that  relate to causes: once the cause gets satisfied, nobody wants to watch the  film.&nbsp; More people would want to watch <em>I Want to Live</em> today if we still  executed people with the gas chamber.&nbsp;  But now it&rsquo;s a period piece &ndash; what the hell is that?&nbsp; Did they ever do that?&nbsp; And this is true now that these people are  back on dry land by now.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>So you were very late among the migration of TV writers from New York to  L.A.?</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">I think so.&nbsp; It just  sort of occurred.&nbsp; I married Carol in  &rsquo;72.&nbsp; We were still living in New York  then.&nbsp; We used to come out here for most  of the year.&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t move out here because  as long as we maintained a residence in New York, all of our expenses out here  were deductible, as if we were visiting the plant and staying at the Holiday  Inn.&nbsp; Everything, haircuts, didn&rsquo;t  matter, all of this was deductible.&nbsp; And  then after a while they . . . raised the question of whether I was really a  resident of New York.&nbsp; In fact, I went  to a hearing in New York, and the IRS said, &ldquo;This man is in California for  eleven months of the year, and he&rsquo;s claiming New York as his residence.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I said, &ldquo;Well, I own a home.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t own a home in California, I own a home in New York.&nbsp; My driver&rsquo;s licence is New York, my car is  registered in New York, I vote in New York.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">The man said, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re here in California for eleven  months of the year.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And then my tax accountant jumps up and he says, &ldquo;Wait a  minute, this man lives in New York.&nbsp; He  is in California for eleven months.&nbsp;  What month does he come to New York?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Well, it turned out that the last couple of years I&rsquo;d spent  August in New York.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Now, tell  me, Harry, is it the position of the United States that this man really lives  in California but he comes to New York in August for his vacation?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And they said, okay, we&rsquo;ll let it go, forget it.&nbsp; Very well done, I thought.&nbsp; I really admired that tax man.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Obviously you were not  yourself blacklisted, but I would imagine that as a politician and a Hollywood  veteran you were keenly aware of the blacklist and its effects. </em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">My son John has a daughter who&rsquo;s in a kind of elegant high  school out in the Valley.&nbsp; It costs a  goddamn fortune but it seems like a nice place.&nbsp; They asked if I would come out and talk about the blacklist,  because I&rsquo;m considered an authority on the blacklist.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Because of your novel </em>Trial<em>?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">I guess so, but they wouldn&rsquo;t know that, these kids.&nbsp; <em>Trial</em> is one of the most obscure movies ever made today.&nbsp; Two or three years ago my wife was called to jury duty in  Glendale, and it&rsquo;s one of these ones where you have to call every night and if  they need you the next day you have to go there.&nbsp; They needed her, and it was a nasty day when she went there and  she really didn&rsquo;t want to go back for the second day.&nbsp; She got put on a panel of about twenty from which a twelve-person  jury was going to be selected.&nbsp; In the  questioning, they asked the jurors to say what their occupations were and what  their spouse&rsquo;s occupations were.&nbsp; She  said that she worked with old people, which she does &ndash; she&rsquo;s an activities  director at a very elegant old persons&rsquo; home.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">&ldquo;And what does your husband do?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a writer.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says his defense attorney, &ldquo;Has he written anything  about the law, or courts, or anything like that?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Now she couldn&rsquo;t think of <em>I Want to Live</em>, which is really a courtroom drama, but she  remembered <em>Trial</em>.&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Yes, he wrote a picture called <em>Trial</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">The defense attorney said, &ldquo;<em>Trial</em>?&nbsp; With Glenn Ford and  Dorothy McGuire?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my favorite  picture!&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">She told me about that that night.&nbsp; She still had to go back the next day.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you don&rsquo;t have to go.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;One of two things could  happen.&nbsp; <em>Trial</em> is the man&rsquo;s favorite picture and he&rsquo;s still [young enough to  be] practicing law?&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t believe  that, because <em>Trial</em> is not a picture  like <em>I Want to Live</em>, [which] you  might have seen years after it was made.&nbsp;  You didn&rsquo;t see <em>Trial</em> &ndash; it  opened at Radio City and it had its run and that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Unless it gets on Turner Classic  Movies.&nbsp; They play it once a year on  Arthur Kennedy&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp; They do that  for dead actors.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And I said, &ldquo;The other thing, aside from the fact that  astonishedly he&rsquo;s still alive, you will not be on that jury.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sure enough, the first thing the next day,  the district attorney challenged her.&nbsp;  He didn&rsquo;t want anybody in the jury whose husband wrote the defense  attorney&rsquo;s favorite picture!&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t  have to know what the hell the picture was.</p>
<p class="style24"><strong>Trial<em> was about  blacklisting, but not in the motion picture industry.&nbsp; You, however, had good seats as the McCarthy era made its way  through Hollywood.</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">My view on the blacklist . . . is not politically correct,  because I believe the people who were blacklisted were no more talented than  anybody else as a group.&nbsp; I agree with  Billy Wilder that of the Unfriendly Ten, two were talented and the other eight  just unfriendly. &nbsp;And I know which two  he had in mind, I think: [Albert] Maltz and Sam Ornitz.&nbsp; Those were the only two there that I  considered really talented.</p>
<p class="style24"><em><strong>Not Dalton Trumbo?</strong></em></p>
<p class="style24">No.&nbsp; Trumbo was a  hack, I think.&nbsp; Trumbo wrote what you  asked him to write, and he was a good, competent writer, and it was outrageous  for him to be blacklisted, or anybody, but he was not necessarily [a great  writer].&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the other thing about  the blacklist: how many of them would have been working <em>without</em> the blacklist?&nbsp; My  father, having written <em>Citizen Kane</em>,  could not get work after that for a period of time.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t precisely blacklisted; it was just [that] people didn&rsquo;t  want to hire him because he was unreliable, he drank, he said what he thought,  particularly when he was drunk.&nbsp; When he  was drunk, he insulted all the people that might otherwise hire him.&nbsp; <em>Citizen  Kane</em> was not [yet] venerated.&nbsp; Today  I think if you wrote <em>Citizen Kane</em> you  could insult people the rest of your life and they would still let you  work.&nbsp; But only because we&rsquo;ve now  discovered that was a really superb picture; we didn&rsquo;t know at the time, we  just thought it was an RKO picture that cost $800,000 and didn&rsquo;t quite make the  $800,000 the first time around.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">Anyhow, how he lived was, we had rented a house on Tower Road,  which today I would say cost easily $2,000,000, with a pool and a triple garage  and an office over the garage, a porte cochere.&nbsp; We had that house rented for fifty dollars a month [from] a  Canadian woman who could not raise the rent because she was incompetent, and  the committee that was handling her affairs wasn&rsquo;t interested.&nbsp; So he would rent that house out &ndash; I think he  probably got $500 on it, paying fifty back to the lady, and live on the  four-fifty, which you could easily do in those days.&nbsp; Then he had a nice little house on Scenic Canyon, where he and my  mother lived.&nbsp; I might have stayed there  a while, too.</p>
<p class="style24">He was at work one day on a spec script &ndash; he did write a  script called <em>Woman on the Rocks</em> afterward which [was a] biography of Aimee Semple McPherson, somewhat  fictionalized &ndash; and he&rsquo;s working away and one day the doorbell rings.&nbsp; And of course, being a writer, he&rsquo;s going to  answer the door because if he doesn&rsquo;t answer the door he&rsquo;s going to have to be writing.&nbsp; I understand that personally; I answer the  door, every time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better than  facing an empty page.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">So he goes to the door.&nbsp;  Here&rsquo;s a fellow who comes in and introduces himself and says, &ldquo;Mr.  Mankiewicz, I&rsquo;m part of a committee and we&rsquo;re raising a fund to help Lester  Cole.&nbsp; You know Lester has been  blacklisted?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">My father says, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; How much work did Lester have before he was blacklisted?&nbsp; Not very much, huh?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; says the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t blacklist a man.&nbsp;  He should have been given the freedom to pursue his career.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">My father says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ve written about forty features, which  is probably ten times as many as Lester, and nobody seems to want to give me  work.&nbsp; Is there any thought of getting  up a committee for me?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And the man said, &ldquo;No, Mr. Mankiewicz, I don&rsquo;t think there  is because the difference is your problem is not political.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">My father said, &ldquo;Oh, I think what you&rsquo;re telling me is that  there will be a committee for Lester Cole but not for me because Lester Cole is  subversive.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">The man said, &ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t put it quite that way.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">My father said, &ldquo;Well, I would.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d put it that way.&rdquo;&nbsp; He  said, &ldquo;Let me tell you something, young man.&nbsp;  If you could see into my secret heart of hearts, you would think Lester  Cole is a patriot.&nbsp; Good day to you,  sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">But he considered himself, and he was, probably more [of an  anti-authoritarian].&nbsp; He was against  whatever was in power, whereas Lester Cole would not have been against it all  the time.&nbsp; If his communists ever came  to power, he [Cole] would have been for them.&nbsp;  But he didn&rsquo;t have much in the way of credits, and neither did the one  that fought in Spain &ndash; Alvah Bessie.&nbsp;  That was really basically his destiny; that was what made him a  celebrated writer, that he fought in Spain.&nbsp;  John Lardner, who had better credits, was killed in Spain.</p>
<p class="style24">My own views are basically that the whole thing of the  blacklist was intolerant sons of bitches seriously mistreating and persecuting  other intolerant sons of bitches.&nbsp; It  should not be; the evil entirely was on the side of the blacklisters, no matter  what these people did.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24"><strong><em>Were you ever tempted  by radical views yourself, or did you share your father&rsquo;s iconoclasm?</em></strong></p>
<p class="style24">The story of my own involvement was: I was young, I was  sixteen and in high school, and I thought, &ldquo;I should do something to prevent  the Nazis from taking over the world,&rdquo; which it looked like they were going to  in 1938.&nbsp; I joined the Hollywood  Anti-Nazi League, which my father said was all right to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not communists,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause  Oscar Hammerstein and Philip Dunne are in that, and they&rsquo;re certainly not  communists.&rdquo;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I joined.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">A lady whose name I&rsquo;ve deliberately forgotten and will never  remember suggested to me, would I like to do undercover work?&nbsp; You ask a sixteen year-old boy to do  undercover work on behalf of a cause that he believes in, you couldn&rsquo;t keep him  away with a stick.&nbsp; Of course I want to  do that!&nbsp; So I joined, at their behest,  William Dudley Pelley&rsquo;s Silver Shirts.&nbsp;  They arranged it and told me how to do it somehow; I don&rsquo;t remember the  details.&nbsp; It was a fascist group who,  according to Pelley &ndash; who I believe was a retired general of some kind &ndash; would  become essentially the same as Hitler&rsquo;s brown shirts.&nbsp; They would take over the streets and beat up people and so  on.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">They met in a hotel on Figueroa.&nbsp; Very spooky and scary.&nbsp;  There were about ten of them, and they were roughly the equivalent of  today&rsquo;s skinheads, except they didn&rsquo;t shave their heads.&nbsp; They were mean, nasty kids, and I was  scared.&nbsp; And I began to become  increasingly scared of the ten of them, even though my father assured me that I  was perfectly safe because probably half of them were plants [by other leftist  or government organizations].&nbsp;  Primarily, I was fearful that they would find out that I was a plant and  that I was not who I claimed to be.&nbsp; To  go down to 10th and Figueroa or wherever this was, you needed a car,  and I borrowed my father&rsquo;s car for this.&nbsp;  One of the hazards was that, in California in those days, you had to  have the registration in a plastic thing that was wrapped around the steering  post.&nbsp; It was easy for them to find out  who owned that car; I had to park it near the meeting.&nbsp; So I told them that my father was a  chauffeur who worked for some Jew in Beverly Hills who said, &ldquo;Oh, you can  borrow the Jew&rsquo;s car,&rdquo; so that if they found that name it wouldn&rsquo;t be too  bad.&nbsp; But they were getting closer all  the time to unmasking me, and I finally got scared to the point where I didn&rsquo;t  want to do it any more.&nbsp; I went to my  control one day after a particular meeting which I really was sure they were  onto me and were just seeing how far I would run before they would take me out  and beat me up.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want  to do this any more.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too  dangerous.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">She said, &ldquo;Well, actually it&rsquo;s funny that you would ask,  because you don&rsquo;t have to do it any more.&nbsp;  You don&rsquo;t have to do it; nobody&rsquo;s going to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I said, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">She said, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not going to penetrate that sort of  organization any more.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">She said, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen this morning&rsquo;s paper?&rdquo;&nbsp; She showed me the paper, and it said that  the night before at seven o&rsquo;clock &ndash; I had not seen the blueline edition of the  Times that night &ndash; the Hitler-Stalin pact had been signed.&nbsp; Now they&rsquo;re not going to do this any more,  the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.&nbsp; She  said, &ldquo;Actually, we&rsquo;re going to have to change our name.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to be the Hollywood League  Against Foreign Fascism.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very interesting. &nbsp;Where do I go to resign?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">And she told me about the membership secretary, and she said  she&rsquo;s very busy this day because a lot of people are resigning.&nbsp; So I went and got in line and resigned.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style24">In the end the Communists took it over.&nbsp; They booted Oscar Hammerstein out, and they  chased Philip Dunne away.&nbsp; Emmet Lavery,  I believe, was in there too, and they got rid of him.&nbsp; The whole problem was, the battle was not between the right wing  and the left wing, it was between the reformers &ndash; today they would be called  liberals &ndash; and the radicals.&nbsp; They are  natural enemies.&nbsp; Reformers want to  improve the system, and radicals want to destroy it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always been that way.</p>

  3<a name="3" id="3"></a>&nbsp; It is unclear whether the <em>Schlitz Playhouse</em> episode &ldquo;Never Wave at a WAC&rdquo; is related to the  film of the same title, which starred Rosalind Russell and was released the  following year.&nbsp; It is possible that  Mankiewicz&rsquo;s jewel thief summary refers to a different teleplay.<br />
  4<a name="4" id="4"></a>&nbsp; Felix Jackson (1902-1992) was a German screenwriter who  emigrated to Hollywood, married Deanna Durbin, and produced movies at Universal  in the forties.&nbsp; The final phase of his  unpredictable career was as a producer of live dramatic anthologies in New  York, chiefly the 1953-1956 seasons of <em>Studio  One</em> (which included Reginald Rose&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twelve Angry Men&rdquo;).&nbsp; <br />
  5<a name="5" id="5"></a>&nbsp; Don&rsquo;s distinguished younger brother Frank Mankiewicz  (1924- ) was Senator Robert Kennedy&rsquo;s press secretary and later the president  of National Public Radio.&nbsp; He managed  George McGovern&rsquo;s 1972 presidential campaign and occupied a slot on Nixon&rsquo;s  enemies list.<br />
  6<a name="6" id="6"></a>&nbsp; Charles Schnee (1916-1963) had screenplay credits on <em>Red River</em> (1948), <em>They Live By Night</em> (1949), and <em>The  Bad and the Beautiful</em> (1952).&nbsp; As a  producer at MGM in the late fifties he also oversaw <em>Somebody Up There Likes Me</em> (1956).<br />
  7<a name="7" id="7"></a>&nbsp; Theodore &ldquo;Ted&rdquo; Sorensen (1928- ) was President Kennedy&rsquo;s  primary speechwriter, and his ghostwriter on the book <em>Profiles in Courage</em>.&nbsp; Robert  W. Saudek (1911-1997), the executive producer of the <em>Profiles in Courage</em> TV series, was a tireless advocate for quality  television best known for producing the cultural affairs series <em>Omnibus</em> in the fifties.<br />
