	 <b>Francis Acheson</b><br>
Francis Acheson, farmer and stock-raiser, Wayne Township, is one of the prominent agriculturists of Tippecanoe County. He is a native of Ireland, born in County Cavan, in April, 1835, a son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Johnson) Acheson. He was reared a farmer in his native county, and when nineteen years old, in May, 1854, left home and embarked on a sailing vessel for the United States, landing in New York in July, after a six weeks voyage. He came direct to La Fayette, where he obtained employment as a farm hand at $13 a month, and was thus employed two years. He then rented land until 1860, when he bought eighty acres of improved land in Jackson Township, near Shawnee Mound, for which he paid $25 an acre. In 1868 he bought the farm where he now lives, to which he moved in 1869, which contains 465 acres of valuable land. He is now one of the well-to-do farmers of the county, and has acquired his property by hard work and good management, assisted by his wife, who has always been a true helpmeet to him. When he landed in La Fayette he had one gold dollar, and his present possessions are the result of his years of labor in this county. He was married March 7, 1860, to Talitha A. Wade, a native of Fountain County, Indiana, who was left an orphan when a child, and was reared by David Meharry. Mr. and Mrs. Acheson have nine children - James William, George Thomas, John Francis, Robert Erwin, Jesse Morton, Lizzie Jane, Alexander Deloss, Charles Emery and Walter Garfield. In 1880 Mr. Acheson was elected county commissioner, and served three years, and it was during his term that the courthouse was built. He is a member of Shawnee Lodge, No. 129, A. F. &amp; A. M. He and his wife are members of the Methodest Episcopal church. In politics he is a supporter of the principles of the Republican party.

<b>Jacob Stanton Albaugh</b><br>
The subject of this sketch has been identified with the business interests of Oxford since 1862. In the thirty six years of his residence here he has been a prominent factor in the town.<br>
He was born at Bowling Green (now Osage), Jefferson county, Ohio, on the 15th of April, 1836, and remained in his native town until his departure for Benton county, Indiana. His education was limited to attendance at the district school during winter seasons until he reached the age of seventeen years. He then became an apprentice in his father's wagon shop, and attended night schools for three years during his apprenticeship.<br>
In 1862 be came to Lafayette, en route to Benton county, that being then the terminus of the railroad. He took &quot; foot and walker's &quot; line from Lafayette to Oxford, a farmer hauling his worldly possessions for two dollars. After looking around for a time he purchased a quarter section of land, but sold it the same year. He located in Oxford and worked at his trade until 1865, when he enlisted as a member of Company K, One Hundred and Forty seventh Indiana Infantry, for one year. After a short stay at Indianapolis for drill and equipment, the regiment was hurried on to Harper's Ferry, thence to Charleston, Stephens' Station and up the Shen-andoah valley to Winchester, finally returning to Harper's Ferry, where it was mustered out, in August, 1865. Though not in any general engagements it was constantly beset with wandering guerrilla bands and was in frequent skirmishes. The marches were very active and exhausting, yet the services and duties were as essential to the cause as though engaged in continuous battle. The territory had to be protected and defended from guerrilla warfare and the purloining of the people's stock during the dying agonies of the Confederacy.<br>
Returning to Oxford after the war, Mr. Albaugh re-engaged in the wagon business, operating a shop on an extensive scale, until 1888, when he sold out his stock and leased the shop and machinery to W. C. Parker. Mr. Albaugh then conducted a meat market near the &quot; square &quot; for five years, or until 1892, when his place was burned out. He then rebuilt his shop and occupied it for three years, when he remodeled the building and leased it to a dry goods merchant, who still occupies it. This is a desirable business property, a two story brick, twenty by seventy feet. With the advent of the cheaper grades of wagons the manufacture of vehicles became unprofitable, and the old shop has been torn down and the business discontinued.<br>
In addition to his varied business interests Mr. Albaugh has also served in several official capacities: was city marshal of Oxford from 1888 to 1892, served a term on the school board, and nine years as township trustee of Oak Grove township, in which Oxford is situated; and he is at the present time president of the Oxford town board. He has been a working member of the Democratic party all his life, and has figured conspicuously in local politics. In recent years his sympathies are with the &quot;free silver &quot; element of &nbsp;the Democratic party.<br>
June 2, 1858, Mr. Albaugh was united in marriage with Miss Elsie, daughter of John and Sarah (Cooper) Travis, natives of Ohio and of Scotch Irish ancestry. The father died at Nekomis, Illinois, and the mother at Knoxville, Ohio. Mr. and Mrs. Albaugh have had one son and six daughters. The two eldest children were born at Bowling Green, Ohio, and the others in Oxford, Indiana. Ella is now the wife of S. Burt Parker, who runs a meat market in Chicago; Emma is the wife of C. A. Scott, a retired farmer in Oxford; May married W. A. Cosson, a farmer and stock dealer near Atkinson Station, in this county; Etta is the wife of John D. Stingle, a prosperous farmer and stock dealer at Pine Village, in Warren county; John W., the only son, died at the age of eighteen years, a bright and promising young man whose untimely death was a severe blow to the sorrowing family; and Belle and Harriet are still at the parental home.<br>
&nbsp;Mr. Albaugh has spent five years' time and not a little money in accumulating a stock of domesticated wild animals. His place is quite a museum of curiosities, where strangers are pleasantly entertained and enlightened. A herd of fourteen deer, in all stages of development, from the beautiful spotted fawns to the antlered and ferocious looking buck. The first stock of these were shipped from Indian Territory, later acquisitions coming from northern Wisconsin. The three squirrels, though not so rare, are very 14 cute &quot; and interesting pets; while the raccoon, crow and a pair of foxes have lost none of their cunning by being domesticated. On the premises there is also a fish pond, covering over an acre of land and stocked with all kinds of fish common to this country.<br>
Mr. Albaugh is fairly well-to-do and takes great pleasure with his pets and in entertaining his many callers and curiosity seekers. Besides a valuable home property, he has a piece of land near town, some improved real estate in Oxford, and the store building previously referred to. He receives a small pension from the government by reason of disabilities incurred in the army.<br>
For fifteen years he has been actively identified with the Odd Fellows order, having attained the encampment degree and held the principal offices in the subordinate lodge and encampment. He is also a member of the grand lodge of Indiana, and for some years has served as district deputy grand master. He also is a member of the order of Knights of Maccabees. In the Grand Army of the Republic he is one of the charter members of the local post. The family is identified with the Presbyterian church, though Mr. Albaugh has never been connected with any religious organization.<br>
The family genealogy of our subject is as follows: Mr. Albaugh is the eldest of the eight children of Reuben and Sarah (Ryder) Albaugh. His father, who was born in Jefferson county, Ohio, but spent his life chiefly as a wagon and carriage maker at Osage, that state, was born in 1810 and died in 1893; and his father, William Albaugh, who was a native of southeastern Pennsylvania, died at Osage, Ohio, in 1878, at the age of eighty years. George Ryder, maternal grandfather, was of German antecedents. The children of Reuben and Sarah (Ryder) Albaugh were named as follows: Jacob S., whose .name introduces this sketch; Sarah, born in 1838, died at Toronto, Ohio, aged fifty eight; Elizabeth, born in 1840, is the wife of D. L. Maple and resides on a farm near Hammondville, Ohio; Isaac, born in 1842, died in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1893; Maggie born in 1844, married C. Eddy, a foreman in a pipe factory at Toronto, Ohio; George, born in 1846, is a mechanic in the employ of the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company and is a resident of Cleveland; Jane is the widow of David Eddy and resides at Toronto, Ohio; and Levi, who was born about 1850, is a farmer residing in Oxford, Indiana.<br>
Our subject is a jolly, whole-souled man who enjoys a joke and is ever ready to return the &quot;fire.&quot; He is now engaged in dispensing &quot;coolness&quot; to suffering humanity in the way of delivering ice to his numerous customers about town.

<b>Joseph H. Anderson, M.D.</b><br>
Joseph H. Anderson, M.D., the only practicing physician of Colburn, is a native of Ohio, born in Guernsey County, November 15, 1838, his father Thomas Anderson, being a native of Pennsylvania, and of English origin. The great-grandfather of our subject, Myron Anderson, was an English sea Captain. He took his son George to sea with him, visiting the port of New York, where the son left the vessel and became a resident of America. He finally settled in Washington County, Pennsylvania, where his son Thomas, the father of our subject, was born. Thomas Anderson went to Ohio, where he was married to Sophia Stevens, and made his home in Guernsey County until his death, which occurred at the home of his son, January 26, 1866. The mother of the doctor still survives her husband, being now in her eighty-third year. Thomas Anderson and wife had ten children, five of whom are living at the present time. Dr. Anderson, the subject of this sketch, was reared on his father's farm, and received his education in the schools of Guernsey County. He began the study of medicine when about twenty-one years of age, and had taken a course of lectures before enlisting in the service of his country during the late war. He had been to Washington Territory, and on his return he enlisted, August 2, 1862, in Company D, Fortieth Iowa Infantry. He served a few months as private and Hospital Steward, when he was promoted to the medical staff of the First Iowa Cavalry, serving with that regiment until the close of the war, and gaining valuable experience. He then returned to Guernsey County, but soon after removed to Allen County, Indiana, locating near Fort Wayne, but after practicing a short time he was obliged to discontinue on account of trouble with his eyes, which had become seriously impaired while in the army. He then engaged in teaching, following that profession two years. In the winter of 1868-'69 he went to Cincinnati, Ohio, to have his eyes treated, and at the same time attended medical lectures, graduating in the spring of 1869. In September, 1869, he came to Colburn, Tippecanoe County, and has since been continuously in the practice of medicine with the exception of the time he spent as a member of the Legislature, having served one term in that body, and during his residence here has built up a successful and extensive practice. The doctor was united in marriage, January 2, 1862, to Miss Margaret M. Morton, a daughter of William Morton, who was a cousin of the great war Governor of Indiana. To this union two daughters were born, of whom only one is living - Lydia O, who was born in 1867. Bertha M. died in 1878, aged eight years. In his political views the doctor is a Republican.

<b>Lt. David Baker</b><br>
One who has figured conspicuously in the growth and development of the Western country is David Baker. He is a native of Indiana and was born in Tippecanoe County, July 7, 1833, near the town of Dayton. He is the son of William and Hannah Baker, the former being of English extraction. The first of the family to come to America was Thomas Baker, a Colonel in the English army, who resigned from that position to come to the colonies, settling on Long island, while it was yet in possession of the Dutch. William Baker was born in New Jersey, and emigrated to Ohio, settling in Buter County, in 1807. He was a soldier in the war of 1812. In 1827 he moved to Indiana, being among the pioneers of Tippecanoe County. There he opened a farm in the timber, and endured the hardships and privation subsequent to the first settlement of a new country. He was a man closely associated with religion, and class leader in the United Brethren Church, and his house, for a number of years, was used to hold services in. His death occurred February 19, 1844. He was married twice. By his first wife he had six children. One son - Robert, lived in Dayton, Ind. The other - Thomas, is proprietor of the Grand Hotel in Indianapolis. Mary Ann was married to Moses Graft, a prosperous farmer. Had a large family. Rachel married a well known physician - Dr. D. H. Crouse, of Dayton, and is now deceased. Two of her children are living, one of whom is Rev. M. V. Crouse, an able clergyman of the Presbyterian Church, of Franklin, Ohio. The other two children of William Baker died when they were young. His second marriage was with Hannah Moore, a native of this country, but of Irish parentage. William Moore was in the war of 1812, and in General Hill's surrender, and then paroled, but in a short time returned to the army, and fought until the close of the war. Hannah Moore Baker was the mother of six children, three of her sons being farmers - Abner in Kansas, Josiah in Illinois, and Samuel in Indiana. The youngest - George W., died in infancy. Her only daughter - Martha Jane, married Dr. J. A. Wood, who, for a number of years, was a resident of Atchison County, Kansas, but since the war has been a resident of Monticello, Ind., at which place he died in 1878, leaving a family of five children. Mrs. Baker, after the death of her husband, married Henry Goble, and removed to Clinton County, Ind. She was a pious woman, and a faithful adherent to the United Brethren church. Her death occurred in 1851, in the full triumph of her faith. Her last words were: &quot;Glory! Glory!&quot; As she opened her eyes once more, to behold her son David, for whom she had seemed to be waiting for hours just at the door of death, then she sank peacefully away. The education of David baker and his brothers was limited, owing to the poor school facilities in Indiana at that early day. His chief amusement while pursuing the routine of the farmer boy, was that of hunting and fishing. When fourteen years of age, he went to Dayton to learn the carpenters' trade with his brother Robert, serving an apprenticeship of three years, when he followed the trade for about the same length of time in Lafayette, Ind. On the 4th of June, 1855, he married Margaret J. Alexander. She lived only until the following year, June 20th, when her death occurred, leaving one infant daughter - Alfaretta Jane, who died a few months later. She was a religious and educated lady, fond of literature, and an admirer of poetry. A few months after this, Mr. Baker came to Kansas, arriving in Atchison County September 19, 1857. He purchased a share in the Sumnertown Company, and pre-empted 160 acres of land near Lancaster, ten miles west of Atchison. He left Kansas December 5, in company with thirteen others, in a skiff, and rowed to Jefferson City, where they took the cars, he returning to Indiana. The 9th of March, 1858, he married Rebecca Foresman, daughter of John Foresman, a pioneer of Indiana. Returned to Kansas with his wife, arriving at Sumner April 29. There he worked at his trade two years. In 1858-59 was township collector and treasurer, and in 1859-60 was marshal of the town of Sumner, an unenviable position at that day, owing to the border element, and Mr. Baker had in many instances some of the most noted outlaws to deal with. Being a Free-state man he took an active part in the affairs of the time, and was a delegate to the first Republican County Convention. His life is replete with incidents too numerous to mention, but A. D. Richardson, the author of &quot;Beyond the Mississippi,&quot; who was a personal friend of his, has pictured the scenes of those times to perfection. In 1861, he began to open his farm, but as the war of the Rebellion was fully upon us, he entered the military service. He was mustered into the volunteer service as a private soldier, in Company G, Eighth Kansas Infantry, November 11, 1861, and on the 14th was ordered to Lawrence for drill. While there, November 21, 1861, was promoted to the rank of First Sergeant of the company. From December 20, 1861, until January 16, 1862, the regiment was guarding the border. Three companies, A, D and G, were ordered to Fort Kearney, where they arrived on March 12, and remained until April 15, when Company G was detached, and sent to Scott's Bluff, on the overland mail route, to quell Indian troubles. On May 28, the company was ordered to Fort Laramie, where they remained on garrison duty until January 15, 1863, when they were ordered to join the regiment at Nashville, Tenn, marching from Fort Laramie to Leavenworth, thence by rail and water to Nashville. They assisted the regiment on provost duty in the city until June 7, 1863, when all the companies were ordered to Murfreesboro, Tenn., where the regiment was assigned to Third Brigade of the First Divison, Twentieth Army Corps, and on June 24 marched under General Rosecrans to Tullahoma, then to Winchester and Stephenson, Ala., and across the river to skirmish with the enemy. While at Winchester, July 25, 1863, Mr. Baker was commissioned Second Lieutenant of Company G, but as it was then below the minimum number, he was not mustered on his commission, and on September 9 received a commission as First Lieutenant, but was again not mustered, as the army was on the move, but acted as First Lieutenant in his company, and on September 19, 1863, was engaged in the battle of Chichamauga, where he was severely wounded in the left leg, and taken prisoner, lying four days on the field without any attention. His leg was amputated by a surgeon of the U. S. Army, who was also a prisoner. After twelve days he was paroled and sent through the lines, and was taken to the officers' hospital in Chattanooga, where he remained until sent to Nashville, Tenn., November 10, 1863. November 30 he received leave of absence for thirty days, to visit his wife and friends at Lafayette, Ind., when he returned and made application to be mustered in on his commission, which was granted by the War Department, and he was mustered November 21, 1864, to date from September 9, 1863. He was then ordered to report to Major A. W. Gazzona, commanding the Veteran Reserve Corps at Nashville, Tenn. Was detailed for duty with detachment of the 148th and 151st companies of the Second Battalion of the Veteran Reserve Corps, at general hospital No. 19, on the 12th of January, 1865. He was released and ordered to report to Captain J. H. Meyer, at the Cumberland Hospital, January 18, 1865. He assumed command of the 154th company of the Second Battalion of the Veteran Reserve Coprs, and in addition had command of the 152nd company of the same battalion. May 31, 1865, he was released from duty from the hospital, and assigned to duty as acting assistant quartermaster and acting assistant commissary of subsistence of the Veteran Reserve Corps. June 27, 1865, he also assumed the duties of acting assistant adjutant of the corps. He served on general court martial duty for some time, and continued in his duties for the Veteran Reserve Corps until the close of the war. December 11, 1865, he left Nashville and returned to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was mustered out January 10, 1866. He is deserving of special mention and the commendation of all true patriots, for the active part he took in quelling the Rebellion. Mrs. Baker also is to be complimented as a woman who shared the hardships of camp life with her husband. With two children she accompanied him to Fort Laramie. At this place was born their third child, November 24, 1862, a son whom they named Robert Laramie, in honor of the birthplace. When her husband was sent to Nashville she left him at St. Louis and went to her parents in Indiana; remained about one year; while there Robert Laramie died, his sickness beginning the evening of his father's return on leave of absence, after being wounded, and his death occurred six weeks later, February 12, 1864, when Mrs. B. went South with her husband; was an eye-witness to the battle of Nashville and remained with him to the close of the war. Her two oldest children were born in Sumner, Kansas - Addie L., March 12, 1859; Solon Byrd, September 8, 1860. The others were all born in Atchison - Mary Eldora, April 4, 1867; Edwin M., February 5, 1869; Eva Hortense, January 24, 1870; David H., January 30, 1873; Estella, July 13, 1876; Ruth, March 30, 1878, and Blanche, born January 28, 1881. Addie L. married December 15, 1880, to William Carlyle, one of Atchison's well known business men. At the close of the war Lieutenant Baker returned to Kansas, locating in Atchison. He entered the drug business with Dr. Horn, but lost his whole stock by fire in 1868. At present he is engaged in the grocery trade, in connection with a meat market, and doing a thriving business. Mr. B. is a member of the Methodist Church. Politically, he is a strong Republican, and in 1871 was elected by that party to the office of County Treasurer, discharging the duties creditably to himself and the satisfaction of his constituents. He was a prominent candidate for the following term, but was defeated by a small majority. He was also a candidate in 1874 for State Treasurer, but finally withdrew in favor of one of the opponents. Since that time he has been leading a quiet life, the surroundings of his home and happy family indicating comfort and prosperity. [Source: William G.

<b>Professor John F. Barnes</b><br>
There is always a great incentive to the young in a perusal of the life history of a successful man, one who has risen to a high place in any community by sheer force of character and the exercise of determination and perseverance. In the person of the subject of this sketch is found such an one. Left an orphan at an early age, he was thus thrown largely upon his own resources, but his was an undaunted spirit and he persisted in his efforts to acquire an excellent education, wisely concluding that with such a foundation success would more surely come to crown his labors in the world's busy highways. He has had wide and varied experience as an educator of the young, and few are better qualified to judge of their needs and capabilities. He thoroughly loves his work, and in this fact doubtless lies the secret of his success.<br>
The Lafayette Business College, of which Professor Barnes is the president, is an institution whose value and high standing in northern Indiana are too well admitted to require a specific testimonial in this connection. Yet a brief recapitulation will be apropos. Without doubt it is one of the best commercial colleges in the state and enjoys numerous and peculiar advantages. Its faculty is composed of live, enterprising men, who, by long experience in business and educational fields, are finely fitted to instruct young men and women in actual business forms and requirements. Pupils are graduating from this college continually, thence to go into business channels and to occupy positions of responsibility and desirability in the great cities and in smaller towns. Scores of them are now valued employees of leading commercial firms in the cities of Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, St. Louis, etc. Moreover, many a young man has doubled his salary by taking a course of stenography, bookkeeping or typewriting. It is well known that many firms nowadays prefer to employ a person who is competent to keep books and to handle their correspondence also, and thus it is infinitely to the advantage of an applicant for a position if he thoroughly understands both kinds of work.<br>
It would seem that no argument should be needed in this day of specialization, of progress, of enterprise, to convince every one, in whatsoever station in life, that he ought to fit himself for some kind of practical work.<br>
Wealth takes unto itself wings, and nothing is certain save what is stored within the mind. It alone is a treasure house to be depended upon in the struggle for a livelihood, which comes sooner or later to the great mass of mankind. Every farmer, every business man, every man of whatsoever occupation or station in life is much better qualified to manage his property and look after his financial interests if he is posted in the various transactions of business life, if he has a practical knowledge of banking and notes, checks, drafts, etc., of contracts and business law. All of these things are carefully drilled into the minds of the students of the Lafayette Business College by a skilled and competent corps of teachers. One specially desirable feature of this college lies in the fact that a point is made of getting its students good and paying positions with reputable firms as soon as said pupils are competent. In the commercial colleges of the great cities this personal interest in scholars is impossible, but here every reasonable effort is made to place graduates in desirable positions, and one member of the faculty makes this his chief business and occupation. Board is, of course, much more reasonable in a place of this size than in a larger city, and all of the environments of students here are more beneficial and conducive to earnest, hard work and study. Among the faculty are the well known educators: J. F. Barnes, the president of the college; E. D. Douglas, who is principal of the English and commercial departments; R. A. Grant, principal of the shorthand and penmanship departments; and Frank Reinier, assistant in the commercial department. Lectures are given on the different lines of business by the leading business men of Lafayette.<br>
Professor John F. Barnes was born in Spencer, Owen county, Indiana, October 13, 1860, a son of Joseph B. and Eliza R. (Smith) Barnes. He was an only son, and his only sister, Eliza R., died when between six and seven years of age. The father, who was a farmer, bravely responded to the call of his country in the civil war, enlisting in the Fourteenth Indiana Volunteer Infantry. After he had gallantly served in many a hard campaign for about three years, his life was laid down as a sacrifice at the second day's battle of the Wilderness. His wife having died but a few weeks previously, our subject was thus left an orphan, but a few years old. His paternal grandfather, who was of German descent, was a farmer and early settler in this state. He died in middle life, at his home near Spencer, Owen county. His children comprised four sons and three or four daughters. The maternal grandfather of our subject, William Smith, was a native of Virginia, and of English descent. A successful farmer and stock raiser, he resided for years in Greene county, Indiana, where he was a pioneer. He reared a large family and died when about seventy five years old.<br>
The boyhood of John F. Barnes was spent upon his maternal grandfather's homestead in Greene county, and his education was that of the common schools and that of the Worthington high school, where he graduated, He then took a normal and commercial course, after which he taught for several years in the graded and district schools. In 1884 he went to the west and for four years traveled and lived in the western part of Kansas, the Indian Territory, Colorado and Texas. In 1888 he returned and for a year was an employee of the Union Milling Company, at Union, Indiana. The following two years he was occupied at his old vocation, that of teaching, and attending the normal school at Princeton, Indiana. During the winter of 1890-91 he was a member of the faculty of the Business University of Indianapolis. In August, 1891, he came to Lafayette, and was the principal of the commercial department of the college up to February, 1897, when he became president of the institution, as well. The college has prospered under his management, having about two hundred students enrolled.<br>
June 30, 1898, Mr. Barnes married Miss Vina Price, daughter of James W. and Elizabeth (Johnson) Price, and their pleasant home is at No. 420 North Seventh street. They are members of Trinity Methodist Episcopal church and are interested workers in its various departments of usefulness. Mr. Barnes is superintendent of a mission Sunday school and is president of the Epworth League of the church. His parents were identified with the same denomination and he was reared in its creed.

<b>Dr. Samuel L. Baugh</b><br>
Dr. Samuel L. Baugh, a prominent member of the medical profession practicing at Shadeland, Tippecanoe county, Indiana, is a native of this county, born August 16, 1854, a son of Leonard and Sarah A. (Talbert) Baugh. His father was a native of Pickaway county, Ohio, and a son of Michael and Nancy (Owens) Baugh. Michael Baugh, a pioneer of that county, was a native of the Keystone state and of sturdy Pennsylvania Dutch stock. He participated in the war of 1812, was a farmer by vocation, and when he settled in Pickaway county the Indians were still plentiful there. He married Nancy Owens, of that county, who was a daughter of Jeremiah and Priscilla Owens. Her father, a pioneer of that county, was of English descent. Both the Baugh and Owens families were Methodists in their religion. Michael Baugh selected a tract of land and cleared it, making a good farm. He died in 1839, aged about thirty five years. In his general character he was a straightforward, highly respected pioneer. His children were Sarah, George H., Leonard and Jonathan.<br>
After his death his widow married, in Pickaway county, Ohio, John Weider, and they moved to Tippecanoe county, Indiana, about 1845, and near Taylor's station, Mr. Weider entered four hundred acres of land for himself and eighty acres for each of the Baugh children, to whom indeed he was always as kind as if they were his own children. He had no children of his own. Erecting a substantial residence, he proceeded to improve his land and to make a comfortable home. He set out an excellent orchard, one of the first in his neighborhood, and it has been greatly appreciated by the family. He was a member of no church, was a temperate, moral and upright man, a good neighbor and friend, a substantial citizen, and much loved and respected. His stepsons have erected a tasteful and substantial tombstone to his memory. He lived to the venerable age of eighty years. Mrs. Weider in her younger days was a member of the Methodist church, but later in life connected herself with the Lutheran church. She was a well known pioneer woman, who brought up her children in excellent habits. Her homestead was known far and wide for its hospitality.</p>
  <p align="left">Leonard Baugh, the father of the Doctor, received a common school education in his youth, and when a young man came to Tippecanoe country Indiana, continuing in the vocation in which he had been reared, that of farming. After marriage he settled upon prairie land, which he improved and converted into a good farm, in Union township, this county. He became the owner of over two hundred acres of land, and died at the comparatively early age of thirty five years, in 1855, of typhoid fever. In this county he married Sarah A. Talbert, a daughter of Joseph and Catherine Talbert, nee Stillwell. Her father came to this county as a pioneer, was a farmer, and his children were John W., Joseph T., Anna M. and Samuel L. Mrs. Baugh was a member of the United Brethren church.</p>
  <p align="left">Dr. Samuel L. Baugh, whose name heads this sketch, was born on his father's farm in Tippecanoe county, attended the district school, also the Farmer's Institute and the academy at Stockwell. He began the study of medicine under the instructions of Dr. Simison, of Romney, and attended Rush Medical College, at Chicago, where he graduated in 1875, and the next year opened out in practice in his native county, where he has ever since been successfully engaged in the practice of his chosen profession. Accordingly he stands well in the esteem of his professional brethren, and as a citizen he is also considered one of the best ornaments of society.<br>
September 30, 1875, in this county, he was united in marriage with .Miss Angie Hawkins, who was born in this county, July 12, 1853, a daughter of William and Hannah (Hollingsworth) Hawkins. The Doctor has two sons, Samuel E. and Leonard W. &nbsp;[Biographical History of Tippecanoe, White, Jasper, Newton, Benton, Warren and Pulaski counties, Indiana, Pg. 356; 1899;&nbsp;transcribed by Debbie Gibson]<br>

<b>William S. Baugh</b><br>
In the words of the Lafayette Journal, William S. Baugh, county treasurer of Tippecanoe county, &quot;has been all his life a conscientious, hardworking Republican, and no man in the county has struck more faithful or harder blows for its success.&quot; He is a man of the people and interested solely in the welfare of the people and in whatever makes for their happiness and prosperity. He was born and reared upon a farm, and has followed agricultural pursuits during his whole life. However, he is a man of more advanced ideas than is the average tiller of the soil, and stands as a type of the best class of progressive, enlightened, thrifty &quot;country gentlemen,&quot; as our English cousins would say. Honorable, upright and earnest in the discharge of the important duties devolving upon him as the custodian of the people's finances, he is all that a treasurer should be, and merit's the confidence which is reposed in him.<br>
Jonathan Baugh, the father of our subject, was one of the honored pioneers of what is now Union township, Tippecanoe county, settling there about 1830. He was born in Pickaway county, Ohio, in 1822, and accompanied his mother and stepfather, John Weider, to this locality, where he grew to manhood. His father, who was of German descent, died in the Buckeye state. Jonathan Baugh married Mary Patty about 1843. She is a native of Oxford, Butler county, Ohio, and is still living in Union township, this county. Her father also died in Ohio and she came to this state with her mother and stepfather. The children born to Jonathan Baugh and wife were Mrs. Nancy E. Taylor; Mrs. Hannah Smalley; Mrs. Jennie Taylor; Alice, deceased; Fremont; William S.; and Mrs. Kate Bone, of Oklahoma. Commencing life a poor man, Jonathan Baugh became very wealthy and successful, as the result of energy and good business methods. At one time he was the owner of over eight hundred acres of fine farming land, and was known far and wide as a stockman and breeder of short-horn cattle. Few men in Union township were better liked or more thoroughly respected. He was a stanch Republican, but never aspired to public office. His death, in 1892, was felt to be a public loss, and his place in the community has not easily been filled.<br>
William S. Baugh was born near Farmers' Institute, Tippecanoe county, November 16, 1859. He received a liberal education in the common schools and in the Valparaiso Normal, at Valparaiso, Indiana, and from his boyhood was associated with his father in the management of the home farm. After the death of the senior Mr. Baugh, the young man succeeded to the control of the property, which includes upwards of half a section of land in Union and Wayne townships. He is a thorough, practical farmer and excellent business man, as was his father before him, and has made a grand success of his various undertakings. He became actively connected with political affairs about ten years ago, and in 1890 was a candidate before the convention for the office of county auditor. He was defeated by Mr. Byers, and again in 1894 the ambitious young man suffered a similar fate, the ever-popular Mr. Jamison being the successful candidate. By this time, however, Mr. Baugh had become well known to the public, who admired his many fine qualities of mind and heart, and when, in 1896, his faithful friends brought his name forward again, this time for the county treasurership [sic], he received a majority of nearly all the votes cast on the first ballot, being nominated over four other aspirants. He was duly elected, and entered upon his new duties January 1, 1897, and in 1898 he was elected for a second term. Socially, he is a Master Mason and a member of the Knights of Pythias.<br>
&nbsp;In 1882 Mr. Baugh married Annie Hollingsworth, of Union township, and three interesting children bless their home - Harry, Jessie C. and Harriet.

<b>Charles H. Beck</b><br>
Charles H. Beck, senior partner in the firm of Beck &amp; Frasch, grocers in Lafayette, was born in this city December 13, 1858, and reared on his father's farm. He attended the district school and assisted his father until he was twenty years of age, when he began clerking in a grocery store. He continued in that position about eight years, when he started in business for himself in the store he still occupies on Main street. Three years later, in 1885, he took in Henry Frasch as a partner and the firm has been doing a good business ever since. Both gentlemen are known as capable, energetic business men, honest in their dealings and reliable in all their transactions.<br>
Mr. Beck was married in April, 1884, to Miss Caroline Frasch, daughter of John and Dorothy (Goerke) Frasch. Although they have no children of their own, Mr. and Mrs. Beck have taken to raise four of Mrs. Beck's deceased sister's children, who found with them a happy home. Our subject is a Republican in his political belief, and with his wife is a member of the Lutheran church. He owns three buildings in the city and has prospered in worldly affairs.<br>
The parents of Mr. Beck were Lucas and Catherine (Wile) Beck, natives of Germany, who came to America in 1838, locating in Lafayette. The father was a shoemaker by trade and later took up gardening. He retired from active life some five years ago, and with his estimable wife is spending the eventide of life in peace and comfort on his farm two miles south of Lafayette. He owns considerable land and is well-to-do. He and his wife are members of the German Methodist church. Six children were born to them, of whom four are living: William, Frank, Charles H. and John J.<br>
The paternal grandfather of our subject was Lawrence Beck, who died in Germany at an advanced age. He was the father of six children. Mr. Beck's maternal grandfather was Tilman Wile, who came from Germany to Lafayette. He had been a gardener in his native land, but never engaged in business after reaching America. He had five children and lived to a good old age. Both grandfathers were soldiers in the Fatherland.

<b>William Boggs</b><br>
William Boggs, farmer, residing on sections 9 and 16, Jackson Township, is a native of Ohio, born in Pickaway County, July 29, 1852, a son of Moses Boggs, now deceased, who was a native of the same county. Major John Boggs, the grandfather of our subject, was one of the pioneer settlers of Pickaway County, and was an honored and respected citizen. He was also a soldier in the war of 1812. William Boggs, whose name heads this sketch, passed his youth on the home farm, being reared to agricultural pursuits, which he has always followed. He received good educational advantages, being a student at Cornell College at Mount Vernon, Iowa, from which institution he graduated in June, 1874. He became a resident of Tippecanoe County in 1876, in which year he settled on his present farm in Jackson Township. He is now the owner of 640 acres of land, which is farmed principally by hired help and tenants. Although he takes an active interest in the welfare of his township and county he never seeks official positions, preferring to devote his attention to his farm. In connection with his general farming he is engaged in the raising of stock, and is making a specialty of graded stock. Mr. Boggs was united in marriage March 11, 1886, to Miss Kate Barnett, a native of Guernsey County, Ohio, a daughter of Walter Barnett, deceased, who held the office of sheriff of Guernsey County for two terms. Her father was a soldier during the war of the Rebellion.

<b>Samuel Bower</b><br>
Samuel Bower, who has been identified with the interests of Washington Township for almost thirty-four years, was born in Montgomery County, Ohio, January 2, 1819, a son of Samuel and Elizabeth (Emerick) Bower, natives of Pennsylvania, the father born in Schuylkill County, and the mother in Adams County. The father was a soldier in the war of 1812. He was married in Montgomery County, Ohio, and in 1832 settled in Preble County, Ohio, where both parents lived until death, the father dying in his eighty-fifth year, and the mother at the age of sixty-eight years. They were the parents of nine children - Jacob, Catherine, Elizabeth, John, William, Samuel, George, Mary M., died at the age of fourteen years, and Sarah, died aged seventeen years. Samuel Bower, Jr., the subject of this sketch, was reared in the usual manner of farmer boys, assisting on the farm in the summer and attending the district schools during the winter months. He was married May 23, 1847, to Miss Harriet Rape, who was born in Preble County, Ohio, and reared on the farm adjoining her husband's boyhood home. Her grandfather was a native of France, and in that country he joined General La Fayette's army, and with it came to America to help General Washington gain his victory. He remained in America after the war, having an uncle in this country he was hoping to find. After crossing the river at Harper's Ferry, he and his comrades stopped at a tavern, which to his surprise he found to be his uncle's. He subsequently settled in Rockingham County, Virginia, where his son John, the father of Mrs. Bower, was born. When John Rape was six years of age his parents removed to Preble County, Ohio, and here he was reared and married to Miss Amilly Trowbridge, the mother of Mrs. Bower. Mr. and Mrs. Bower have had born to them five children, four of whom are yet living - Benjamin F., Alfred N., Mary Etta and Sarah Alice. J. W. died in his sixth year. In 1854 Mr. Bower brought his family by team to Tippecanoe County, Indiana, and bought eighty acres of his present farm, which was partially improved. By persevering industry and good management he has prospered in his agricultural pursuits, and has added to his original purchase until he now owns 321 acres, all well-improved and under a high state of cultivation, with comfortable residence and excellent farm buildings for his stock and grain. His barn, which is one of the best in his township, is 38 x 69 feet in size, with 16-foot posts, and good stone basement. Mr. Bower is also a first-class blacksmith as well as farmer, and has worked at his trade considerably, both for himself and his neighbors. In politics Mr. Bower affiliates with the Democratic party. He is a member of the Evangelical Lutheran church. He is a man of firm purpose, strong in his beliefs of right and wrong, fair and honorable in all his dealings, and is held in high esteem by all who know him.

<b>John Brand</b><br>
Upon one of the farms first developed in Sheffield township, Tippecanoe county, Indiana, resides John Brand, a substantial and progressive farmer, whose well tilled fields and substantial buildings indicate the careful supervision of an industrious and energetic owner. His birth occurred upon this homestead, which had become the home of his parents in 1835. His father had previously visited the county, having made three trips to Indiana. On his visit in 1834 he purchased the property and located thereon the following year. The land was in part entered from the government by Joseph Slater in 1829, and John Brand still has in his possession the original deed, signed in the bold handwriting of Andrew Jackson, then president of the United States. Four years later, in 1833, a portion of this farm was entered by George Storm.<br>
Very little had been done in the way of improvement when Samuel Brand took possession of the property, and in clearing and developing the land he was assisted by his sons, including John Brand, whose birth occurred on the farm April 16, 1841. His education was largely acquired in a small frame school building which stood on the northeast corner of the farm, and was built by the neighbors for school purposes, but his first instruction was received in his father's log cabin, where for a time school was held. He early became familiar with all the duties and labors that fall to the lot of the agriculturist, and thus when he began life for himself was well prepared by practical experience to manage the work of the farm. In 1866 he was married and brought his bride to the old family homestead, where he is still living. The playground of his boyhood thus became the scene of his manhood's labors, and the fields where he was wont to romp in youth, afterward yielded to him golden harvests in return for the care and cultivation he bestowed upon them. He purchased the farm of his father,a tract of one hundred and sixty-two acres. This had been cleared by the father and his sons, but Mr. Brand has added many substantial improvements and now has a very valuable property supplied with all the conveniences and accessories of the model farm. From time to time he has purchased other lands until his farm now comprises three hundred and seventeen acres, and in addition he has other valuable property elsewhere. He is also one of the directors and stockholders of the Farmers' National Bank, of Mulberry, of which he was one of the founders, and is an enterprising business man, whose capable management, sound judgment and great energy have brought to him prosperity.<br>
On the 7th of February, 1866, Mr. Brand was united in marriage, in Madison township, Clinton county, Indiana, to Miss Sarah Elizabeth Camp-man, a native of Pennsylvania and a daughter of Lewis F. and Maria (Moyer) Campman. Her father was born in New Jersey and was of sturdy English ancestry and educated in the German language. Lewis Frederick Campman was born at Hope, New Jersey, February 2, 1794, a son of Christian Frederick and Annie Mary Campman. November 12, 1829, he married Mary Moyer, a daughter of David and Sarah Moyer, and their children were Frederick Andrew, born March 23, 1831; Henry Frantz, January 16, 1833; Mary Annie, August 6, 1834; David, May 3, 1836; Louis Henry, January 23, 1838; James William, April 23, 1839; and Sarah E., December 28, 1840. The father followed farming in early life, afterward engaged in school-teaching in New Jersey, and subsequently engaged in clerking in a store. Later he went to Philadelphia, where he accepted a position as cashier in a bank, and on severing that connection he returned to Grimville, Pennsylvania, where he engaged in clerking until an advanced age. He afterward lived with his children in Indiana, and died at the home of our subject, when about seventy-eight years of age. He was a straightforward, honorable man, a highly respected citizen and a consistent member of the Reformed church. By the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Brand were born six children, namely: AlvinS., born October 28, 1867; Sylvester L., born December 20, 1868; Lilly Ellen, born March 9, 1871; Katie Ann, born January 31, 1872; Guy Orlando, born October 17, 1875; and May Susannah, born March 27, 1879.<br>
Both Mr. and Mrs. Brand are members of the German Reformed church, and in his political connections he is a Republican. He also belongs to the Odd Fellows lodge, of Mulberry, and is popular with his brethren of the fraternity. He has always been a man of great industry, intelligence and determination in business, and through his well directed efforts has won a handsome competency that numbers him among the substantial citizens of the community. There has been nothing in his life to awaken the condemnation of his fellow men; on the contrary he commands uniform regard, and is accounted one of the leading residents of Sheffield township, Tippecanoe county. [Biographical History of Tippecanoe, White, Jasper, Newton, Benton, Warren and Pulaski counties, Indiana; 1899]<br>

<b>Samuel Brand</b><br>
Study of the history of Tippecanoe county will soon disclose the fact that the Brand family has been one of the most prominent from the time of the earliest settlement here to the present. Its representatives have been especially active in promoting the agricultural interests, and at all times have been numbered among that class of loyal citizens who promote the public good while advancing individual prosperity, and who labor earnestly and consecutively for the improvement and betterment of the community with which they are associated. Such a man was Samuel Brand, the subject of this review, and at his death the county lost one of its best residents. He was born on the old family homestead in Sheffield township, February 22, 1837, and is a son of Samuel Brand, an honored pioneer of the locality, who was born in Maryland, December 13, 1802. His father, who also bore the name of Samuel Brand, removed from Maryland to Pennsylvania and thence to Ohio, locating among the pioneers of Butler county, that state. There he carried on farming, and also operated a distillery near Hamilton, Ohio. He spent his remaining days in Butler county, and reached an advanced age. Both he and his wife were members of the United Brethren church, and to them were born nine children, namely, Samuel, Michael, Elizabeth, Barbara, George, Susan, John, Mary and Rebecca.<br>
Samuel Brand, the father of our subject, was a boy when he accompanied his parents to Ohio. There he acquired a limited education, and on attaining his majority married Lydia Vance, the wedding taking place December 19, 1826. The record in the old family Bible says that she was born November n, 1805, and that their children are Elizabeth, born May 19, 1828; Washington, born February 22, 1830; Mary Ann, born October 27,1831; Michael, born December 29, 1833; Samuel, born February 20, 1837; Eli, born September 11, 1839; John, born April 16, 1841; and Lydia, born January 7, 1844. The mother of these children died November 27, 1859, and Mr. Brand was afterward married, on the 6th of April, 1865, to Mary Burkhalter. They had no children who reached years of maturity. Mrs. Brand died April n, 1869, and Samuel Brand, Sr., departed this life September 211 1872. Upon his first marriage he located on a farm in Butler county, Ohio, whence he removed to Tippecanoe county, Indiana, about 1835 and made a home in Sheffield township.<br>
It was upon the old farmstead that the birth of our subject occurred. He was afforded the usual common school advantages, but being a good student he became a well informed man, adding largely to his knowledge through reading, experience and observation. The occupation to which he was reared he made his life work, and was accounted one of the enterprising and prosperous farmers of his neighborhood.<br>
When about twenty-three years of age he was married in Sheffield township, Tippecanoe county, to Sarah A. Peter, who was born July 4, 1838, in Lehigh county, Pennsylvania, a daughter of John and Mary (Kern) Peter. Her grandfather also bore the name of John Peter and was a brother of William Peter, an honored pioneer of Clinton county, Indiana.<br>
John Peter, Sr., carried on agricultural pursuits in Lehigh county, Pennsylvania, and was a substantial citizen. He was a member of the German Reformed church and enjoyed the high regard of all who knew him. His children were Jacob, John, Elizabeth, Leah, Sallie and Lydia. Mr. Peter, the father of Mrs. Brand, was born in Lehigh county, Pennsylvania, and also made farming his life work. He married Mary A. B. Kern, a daughter of Nicholas Kern, whose family were relatives of the family of William Peter. Nicholas Kern resided near Slatington, Lehigh county, where he owned a large farm and was also financially interested in a slate mine. He acquired a handsome competence and died on his farm at the age of eighty years. In the Lutheran church he held his ecclesiastical membership. His children were Henry, Jacob, Stephen, Eli, Polly and John.<br>
After his marriage John Peter located on his father's farm, where five of his children were born. In the fall of 1840 he came to Indiana, making the journey with team and wagons, accompanied by Jonathan Peter, a second cousin of Mrs. Brand, and Henry Kern, a brother of Mrs. John Peter. John Peter located in Sheffield township, Tippecanoe county, on eighty acres of timber land, of which only a few acres had been cleared. He cut down the remainder of the trees, transformed the land into fertile fields and made an excellent pioneer home, at the same time adding to his property until his farm comprised one hundred and twenty acres. He was an elder in the German Reformed church, and his wife was a member of the Lutheran church. In politics he was a Republican. His death occurred in 1859, when he had attained the age of fifty three years. His chief characteristics were such as commended him to the confidence and respect of all. He was industrious and enterprising, temperate and moral, loyal to his duties of citizenship and devoted to the best interests of his family, rearing his children so that they became an honor and credit to his name. <br>
At the time of their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Brand began their domestic life in Perry township, Tippecanoe county, upon a farm of one hundred and eighty six acres, of which eighty acres had been cleared. Mr. Brand continued its further development, and transformed it into richly cultivated fields, which yielded to him a golden tribute in return for the care he bestowed upon them. As his financial resources increased he purchased other lands and extended the boundaries of his farm until it embraced two hundred and twenty six acres. He erected a substantial residence and commodious barns and out buildings for the care of his stock and conducted his farming operations on a most progressive and improved plan. His life was not uncheckered by difficulties and obstacles, but these he overcame by determined purpose and steadily advanced in the path to success.<br>
Mr. Brand was a man of high moral character, of temperate habits and peaceable disposition, reliable in all business transactions, faithful to all duties of citizenship. Such qualities won him the esteem of his fellow men, and made his example one worthy of emulation. He died January 7, 1895, at the age of fifty seven years, eleven months and seventeen days, and the entire community mourned his loss. He was a faithful member of the Presbyterian church and held the office of church trustee. His wife is also a consistent member of the same church. Since the fall of 1898 she has made her home in Dayton, where she has recently completed a tasteful and pleasant residence. She is a lady of good business ability and many virtues, and to her husband was a practical helpmeet. She has many friends in the community and enjoys the hospitality of the best homes of Dayton.

<b>John Y. Carpenter</b><br>
This most wide-awake and progressive citizen of Monte Vista, Colorado, whose restless energy and unconquerable spirit have led him into many sections of the country and a great variety of pursuits, and who has shown that he could be as courageous and gallant in war as he was industrious and many-handed in peace, was born at Lafayette, Tippecanoe county, Indiana, on June 8, 1838, and is the son of John and Ellen (Youel) Carpenter, natives of Ohio, who some years after their marriage moved to Indiana and there passed the remainder of their lives, the mother dying there in 1843 and the father in 1873. Five of their children are living, Mrs. Lafayette Booth, of Cincinnati, Ohio, Mrs. David Ward, of Crowley, Louisiana, Mrs. John Kerr, John Y., and Benjamin C., who lives at Perryville, Indiana. John Y. received a limited common school education, and in 1860, when he was twenty-two, his father started him in the drug business at Rainsville, Warren county, his native state. When the Civil war broke out he enlisted in the Eleventh Indiana Infantry under Colonel (afterward General) Lew Wallace, and though he served until November 15, 1863, and was in several fiercely fought battles, among them the capture of Fort Donelson and the engagement at Shiloh, he received only a few slight flesh wounds. After sixteen month's service in the infantry he was promoted to the Second Arkansas Cavalry, Troop C., and was mustered out as captain of that command. He returned to Indiana on leaving the army, and farmed until September, 1865, when he moved to Benton county, Missouri, where he resumed farming and raising stock, and followed that occupation eight years. He then kept the National Hotel in Sedalia, Missouri, three years and a half, and in 1877 moved to Joplin, the same state, where he engaged in mining lead until July, 1879, when he crossed the plains with a party of seventy persons conveyed by thirteen wagons drawn by horses, to San Juan in southeastern Utah. The party separated at various places until Mr. Carpenter was left alone. He crossed the mountains in this state, going over Walsenburg La Vesta pass, by Fort Garland and Conejos, and across Cumbers, the principal pass of the Rockies. The silver excitement took him into the Indian country where they savages were still hostile, and he had many thrilling adventures with them. He prospected in Utah seven months without success. He then came into Colorado, and during the next two years kept a hotel and prospected at Parrot City in La Plata county. In 1883 he changed his residence to what is now Montezuma, where he located land and began farming and raising stock, which he continued until 1889, when he sold all his interest, and locating at Durango, again turned his attention to miming, being interested in the Tempest Mining &amp; Milling Company at the head of the Florette river. In 1891 he moved to Summitville and continued his mining operations with the aid of his sons. The Pass-Me-By Tunnel, Mining &amp; Milling Company was formed by them and its properties developed, and from its organization Mr. Carpenter has served as its secretary. From 1902 to 1904 he conducted the Blanco Hotel at Monte Vista. The Pass-Me-By has one thousand two hundred feet of tunnel on surface work and four thousand feet on the water level, cross-cutting eleven claims, and is equipped with as fine machinery as can be had. Its ores are mainly gold, with very little silver or copper. Mr. Carpenter and his sons are engaged in the business of breeding the Angora goat in Colorado, and have bred the stock with great success and profit. They have eight hundred acres of land, well improved and sufficiently irrigated for the cultivation of seven hundred acres. On this they conduct a general ranching industry and raise cattle and horses extensively. Mr. Carpenter was married on March 2, 1864, in Warren county, Indiana, to Miss Marian Mitchell, a native that county. Four of their seven children are living, Ulysses G., promoter and president and general manager of the mining company already mentioned and the Asiatic Mining &amp; Milling Company, west of it; Orion P., a ranchman; Clarence J., a practical miner; and Tula. Both father and sons are earnest Republicans in politics and belong to the order of Elks; and the sons also belong to the Maccabees. Their ranch is three miles and half east of Monte Vista, and has the second best water right on the Rio Grande. It is improved with good buildings and in a forward state of cultivation.

<b>James Carter </b><br>
James Carter resides, on section 33, Washington Township, where he settled in January, 1882, at that time purchasing seventy-five acres, where he made his home, and forty acres located elsewhere in the same township. Mr. Carter is a native of Indiana, born in Franklin County, April 20, 1838, a son of Abraham and Lucy Carter. Abraham Carter was born in New Jersey, a son of Benjamin Carter, who was a Quaker, and a member of the original Penn Colony of Pennsylvania. He was reared in New Jersey, where he served an apprenticeship at the hatter's trade, but devoted his life to agricultural pursuits. He removed to Franklin County, Indiana, in an early day, being a pioneer of that county. He died in Franklin County in 1859, a much respected citizen. He was a Mason of high degree, having been made a Royal Arch Mason in May, 1819. He was four times married, and was the father of nineteen children. His first wife, Susan (Malon) Carter, died in New Jersey. His second wife, Peggy (Hichner) Carter, died in Franklin County, Indiana. For his third wife he married Mrs. Lucy (Wheat) Smith, and his fourth wife was formerly Hester Brown. The mother of our subject was a daughter of William Wheat, who served as a soldier in the Revolutionary war. She was twice married, and by her first husband had four children. By her marriage with Abraham Carter she had four children, of whom James, the subject of this sketch, was the eldest. James Carter was reared to the vocation of a farmer on the home farm in Franklin County, and was just twenty-one years of age when his father died. He enlisted in the war of the Rebellion April 21, 1861, in the three months' service, in the Twentieth Ohio Infantry. He served the term of his enlistment, and in August of the same year re-enlisted in Company I, Eleventh Indiana Infantry. He veteranized in March, 1864, serving until August 25, 1865. He was on hospital duty much of the time, being hospital steward for two years. He was with his regiment all the time, and was on the field at the following battles - Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Champion Hills, siege of Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi. In 1864 the regiment was transferred from the Thirteenth to the Nineteenth Corps, and fought with General Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley. Mr. Carter was at the battle of Cedar Creek when Sheridan came upon the field after his memorable ride from Winchester, twenty miles away, and saved the day. Although not severely wounded in battle Mr. Carter returned home from the war with health much impaired by the arduous duties he had to perform, and he has never recovered from the effects of his army experience. Mr. Carter was married January 11, 1866, to Miss Sarah D. Murphy, a native of Franklin County, Indiana, born March 17, 1842, a daughter of Recompense and Welty Murphy, both of whom are deceased. Soon after his marriage Mr. Carter removed from Franklin to Carroll County, where he purchased a farm and there followed agricultural pursuits until coming to Tippecanoe County, in 1882. He is the present trustee of Washington Township, to which office he was elected in 1884, and re-elected in 1886. He is a Master Mason, being a member of Transitville Lodge, No. 425, and is also a member of Waymire Post, G. A. R., at Buck Creek. Both he and his wife are active and consistent members of the Methodist Episcopal church. They are the parents of two children, named Bertha A. and Henry C., both born in Carroll County. Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, the parents of Mrs. Carter, were among the pioneers of Franklin County, Indiana, removing there with their parents before their marriage. They were natives of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, the father being born in the year 1805, a son of Samuel Murphy, who was one of the first settlers of Franklin County, locating there in 1818. Mrs. Carter was but nine years old when her mother died. Her father died in Franklin County in March, 1880. Nine children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, three sons and six daughters, all yet living, Mrs. Carter being the only member of her father's family residing in Tippecanoe County.

Capt. S.B.J. Caster</p>
  <p align="left">Captain S. B. J. CASTER, retired blacksmith and wagon maker, is a native of Tippecanoe County, Indiana, born in Wabash Township, August 23, 1827, a son of Peter and Jane (Bringham) Caster, who were natives of Kentucky and Virginia, respectively. In 1824 the parents immigrated to this county, making the journey by wagon drawn by oxen, and settled in Wabash Township in the vicinity of Chauncey. Here the father entered 160 acres of land which he intended to buy at the land sale, but was overbid in his price, and moved farther north in the same township where he bought a tract of 160acres. He added to this purchase until he had 340 acres which he improved and brought under good cultivation, farming on this laud until his death when it was divided among his heirs. He was a prominent man in the early history of the county, and for several years held the office of justice of the peace. He was quite fond of trapping, at which occupation he made much money, as game was then very plentiful. Indians were numerous at the time of his settlement, and were a source of much annoyance to many of the early settlers. Mr. Caster would frequently hunt deer on horse-back, and has brought down many a deer at long rifle range. He died in the year 1867, his widow surviving until 1874. They were the parents of ten children, three daughters and seven sons, and of these only the subject of this sketch is living. He was reared on the home farm to agricultural pursuits until eighteen years of age, when he began to learn the blacksmith's trade, at which he served an apprenticeship of three years. At the breaking out of the Mexican war, in May, 1846, he enlisted in Company B, First Indiana Infantry, serving a little over a full term, and participated in one skirmish on the Rio Grande River. While in the war he held the commission of Second Corporal. At its close he resumed work at his trade, and in 1848 went into business for himself, and at the same time engaged in the manufacture of wagons, which he carried on until the breaking out of the war of the Rebellion. He enlisted as a private in August, 1861, in Company D, Fortieth Indiana Infantry, and December 31, 1861, he was commissioned Captain of his company, holding this position through the service, with the exception of two months, his absence then being caused by disability. He led his regiment to the battles of Shiloh, Corinth, Perryville, Stone River, Missionary Ridge, Dalton, Resaca, Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain, and while at the last mentioned place he received his discharge and returned home, being mustered out in June, 1864. He then worked at his trade, which, he has since followed, although now not actively engaged in any business. Mr. Caster was first married in 1848 to Miss Mary Lynch, a daughter of John Lynch, and to this union eight children were born, as follows - Charles L, Squire C., Samuel J., Catherine J., Martin V. (deceased), Lawrence A., Perry and James. Mrs. Caster died in the year 1874, and in 1877 Mr. Caster was again married to Miss Susan J. Critser, of Chauncey. Mr. Caster helped plat the little village of Kingston, building the first house in the village, and donating several lots in order to people the place. He has always taken an active interest in the welfare of his township and county, and in every official position he has filled he has served to the best interests of the same. He held the office of justice of the peace one term, being elected in 1854. In 1860 he was elected township trustee, serving as such until enlisting in the war in 1861. He was again elected township trustee in the spring of 1874, holding this office three successive terms by re-election. In his political views Mr. Caster is independent. He takes an active interest in the cause of temperance, being a great temperance advocate. Both he and his wife are members of the Methodist Episcopal church.

<b>William H. Caulkins </b><br>
William H. Caulkins, county superintendent of schools, is a native of Tippecanoe County, Indiana, born in Lauramie Township, a son of William and Anna Caulkins, his father being one of the prominent pioneers of the county, and who was born in Morris County, New Jersey, and reared in Central New York, coming thence to Tippecanoe County at an early day, and entering a tract of rather poor Government land. He had made the trip to the county in a wagon, and worn out by the tedious journey, he was glad to take the first land he could get without going further to select better. He made many improvements on this land, where he made his home until his death. He was married in this county to Mrs. Anna (Rerick) Heaton, whose mother came from Onondaga County, New York, to Indiana, and located in Hamilton County. She was born May 5, 1808. Her father was a soldier in the war of 1812, and was killed at Fort George. She was first married to John S. Heaton, and after their marriage they removed to Dayton, Tippecanoe County, Mr. Heacon being one of the founders, and a pioneer merchant of the place. He died at Dayton, and his widow afterward married William Caulkins, who died December 23, 1847. Mr. Caulkins was a Whig in his political affiliations, and was an active man in public affairs. His widow still survives and makes her home in Wabash Township. William H. Caulkins, whose name heads this sketch, was but four years old when his father died, after which event he was taken by his mother to Dayton, this county, and still later to Wabash Township, where he was reared to manhood, receiving his education in the common schools of the township, and at the Stockwell Collegiate Institute. He entered the Union service at Indianapolis, Indiana, in May, 1862, enlisting in Company G, Fifty-fourth Indiana Infantry, under the command of Major Fielding Mansfield. His regiment went to the front at Bowling Green, Kentucky, and was engaged principally along the line of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad during the summer. It received several attacks by the Rebel General Morgan, and was almost destroyed, losing by capture no less than six companies. Company G, with the remaining companies, returned to Louisville with the advance of Buell's army, on the occasion of the celebrated foot-race between Buell and Bragg. Mr. Caulkins was a drummer of his company, but did a private's duty most of the time. He was honorably discharged the following October. He began teaching school in the winter of 1862-'63, and has ever since been engaged in public school work. In August, 1874, he was appointed county school superintendent, and has since then been re-elected to the same office seven times, which plainly shows his efficiency as an officer and popularity in the county. He is a member of the Indiana Teachers' Association, an organization in which he takes an active interest. He is a member of the Masonic and Odd Fellows orders, belonging to the Blue Lodge, Chapter and Commandery of the former, and to La Fayette Lodge, No. 15, of the latter. In 1875 he was worshipful master of Perry Lodge, No. 37, F. &amp; A. M. He is also a comrade of Marsh B. Taylor Post, No. 475, G. A. R. He is editor and publisher of The Public School, a monthly journal devoted to educational interests. He is also editor of the Country School Department of the Indiana School Journal. In politics Mr. Caulkins is a zealous Republican, ever loyal, never wavering, and always ready to make personal sacrifice for the best interests of his party. In 1867 he was married to Mary Alice O'Neal, a daughter of Thomas H. O'Neal, one of the early settlers of Lauramie Township, and who represented the county for two or more terms in the State Legislature.

<b>Jacob Chapman </b><br>
Jacob H. Chapman, a representative of one of the early pioneer families of Tippecanoe County, was born in Botetourt County, Virginia, June 17, 1825, a son of Nathan and Margaret (Hansel) Chapman, who were also natives of Virginia. The father left Virginia with his family and his brother William about 1834, for Indiana, and for a time lived at Terre Haute. He was a miller by trade, as were his brothers. Nathan Chapman followed milling in various places in Indiana, and also taught a private school for a time. At the time of his death, in 1870, he was living in Washington Township, this county, at the home of his son, Jacob. A brother, Jacob Chapman, came to this county several years before Nathan and William settled here, and became prominently identified with its interests. He owned at one time a part of the town site of Colburn, and laid out that town about the time the railroad reached the place. Nathan Chapman and wife had eight children, of whom three are living - Julia, Jacob H., our subject, and Margaret. Jacob H. Chapman, whose name heads this sketch, was a lad of about nine years when brought by his parents to Indiana, and since then the greater part of his life has been spent in Tippecanoe County. He learned the miller's trade of his father. He was married July 29, 1847, to Maria Richardson, and they are the parents of six children - Anthony G., Albert, Theodore M., John F., Mrs. Lucy Carley and Mrs. Effie Bates. Mr. Chapman has resided on his present farm since his marriage, and during his long residence here he has gained the confidence and esteem of the entire community. He laid out Chapman's first and second additions to what is now known as Colburn. Chapmanville is the name by which the plat was recorded, though the station and postoffice are called Colburn. Like his father, Mr. Chapman affiliates with the Democratic party in his political views.

<b>Emily Thorton Charles</b><br>
Mrs. Emily Thornton Charles, poet and journalist, born in Lafayette, Ind., 21st March, 1845. She comes of English ancestors, the Thorntons and Parkers. On the paternal side the Thorntons were noted as original thinkers. Her great-grandfather, Elisha Thornton, carried a sword in the War of the Revolution. Her grandfather, also Elisha Thornton, resident of Sodus, Wayne county, N. Y., served in the War of 1812. Her father, James M. Thornton, gave his life to the cause of the Union in 1864, and of her two brothers, Charles lost his life in the Civil War, and Gardner served in Harrison's regiment. The Parkers, her maternal ancestors, were among the primitive Puritans. Deacon Edmund Parker settled in Reading, Mass, about 1719, the family removing thence to Pepperell, Mass., which town they helped to found. For more than a century, from father to son, the Parkers were deacons and leaders of the choir in the Congregational Church. When Emily's grandfather married, the young couple took a wedding journey in a sleigh to find a new home in Lyons, Wayne county, N.Y., taking with them their household goods. Twenty years later their daughter, Harriet Parker, was married to James M. Thornton, a civil engineer, son of Elisha. The young couple moved to Lafayette, Ind., where Mr. Thornton established a large manufactory. Emily Thornton was educated in the free schools of Indianapolis, and at the age of sixteen she became a teacher. As a child in school she attracted attention by the excellence of her written exercises and her original manner of handling given subjects. She became the wife, while very young, of Daniel B. Charles, son of a business man long established in Indianapolis. At the age of twenty-four she was left a widow, in delicate health, with two little ones dependent upon her. Soon after the death of her husband, 1874, she began to write for a livelihood, doing reportorial and editorial work for Indianapolis papers and correspondence for outside publications. She succeeded well. Having chosen journalism as a profession, she perfected herself in all its branches. She published her first volume of verse under the title &quot;Hawthorn Blossoms&quot; (Philadelphia, 1876). This little book was received with great favor and proved a literary and financial success. From the Centennial year to 188o she continued to do newspaper work and biographical writing. She was associate editor of &quot;Eminent Men of Indiana.&quot; In 1881 she accepted a position as managing editor of the Washington &quot;World.&quot; Afterwards she established &quot;The National Veteran&quot; in Washington, D. C., of which she was sole proprietor and editor. In 1883 Mrs. Charles was prostrated through overwork and was confined to her bed for an entire year. While recovering slowly, she spent a year in revising and preparing for publication her later poems. The work appeared in &quot;Lyrical Poems&quot; (Philadelphia, 1886), a volume of three-hundred pages. That volume fully established her reputation as a national poet. She has appeared upon the lecture platform with success. On the occasion of her departure from Indiana, when a complimentary farewell testimonial was tendered her by the leading citizens of Indianapolis, in 1880, she made a brilliant address. In 1882 she addressed an audience of 1,500 ex-prisoners of war in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her poetical address on &quot;Woman's Sphere&quot; was delivered before a National Woman's Suffrage Convention. She is a member of the executive committee of the National Woman's Press Association and chairman of the executive council of the Society of American Authors. She has been selected as one of the speakers at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Mrs. Charles writes almost exclusively under the name of &quot;Emily Thornton.&quot; (American Women Fifteen Hundred Biographies Vol. 1, by Frances Elizabeth Willard &amp; Mary Ashton Rice Livermore, Publ. 1897.

<b>John Cloyd </b><br>
John Cloyd, of Wea Township, is a representative of one of the old and honored pioneers of Tippecanoe County, his father, William Cloyd, having settled here at an early day. William Cloyd was born and reared in the State of Tennessee, and was there married to Esther Neal. He removed to Miami County, Ohio, among the early pioneers, with his wife and four children, and in 1828 he came to Tippecanoe County, bringing with him his wife and five children, while several of the older children, who were married, remained in Ohio. The same year he bought land on section 35, Wea Township, and here made a good farm on which he lived until his death. He was married a second time, but his second wife has long since passed away. Of the children born to his last marriage two sons and a daughter yet survive. William Cloyd was a worthy citizen, and one of the most highly esteemed of the early settlers. In politics he was a Democrat of the Jackson school. John Cloyd, whose name heads this sketch, was born in Ohio, December 8, 1816, and is the only surviving child of his father's first marriage. He was in his thirteenth year when brought to this county, and well remembers the condition of the county almost sixty years ago, and has witnessed the many changes which have occurred in that time, transforming the wilderness into a well-settled country. He was reared to manhood on the home farm amid the scenes and incidents of pioneer life. He has lived within two miles of the old homestead since coming here in 1828, and now owns 160 acres of the pioneer farm. His present home is on section 26, Wea Township, and he has altogether 400 acres of choice land, acquired by industry, economy and good management, and is classed among the substantial citizens of the county. Mr. Cloyd was first married to Miss Elizabeth Nicewander, who died in 1852. For his second wife he married Miss Jane Bailey, a daughter of Silas Bailey. She is also deceased, her death taking place April 7, 1880. Mr. Cloyd has had a family of fourteen children, six by his first marriage and eight by his second. Three sons and seven daughters are living at the present time, as follows: William, Ritchie, Thomas B., Maria, Margaret, Louisa, Ellen, Esther, Martha and Anna. Mr. Cloyd has always taken an active interest in the advancement of his township and county, and any enterprise having that object in view has had his encouragement and support. He is a man of strict integrity, honorable in all his dealings, and is held in high esteem by all who know him.

<b>John Cloyd</b><br>
John Cloyd is today one of the oldest pioneers of Tippecanoe county. The time of his residence in the county antedates that of most pioneers, for in 182S he came to this locality, and has since been identified with the development, progress and advancement of the county. He is descended from Irish ancestry, his grandfather, William Cloyd, having been born on the Emerald Isle, whence he emigrated to America in his early manhood. He located in Tennessee prior to the war of the Revolution, and in that state followed the blacksmith's trade, near Jonesboro, up to the time of his death. He was married in that locality to Miss Jane Barr, a native of Ireland, who ran away from home in order to become his wife. Their children were Joseph, Samuel, William, John, Sarah and Jane. Samuel served his country in the war of 1812. William Cloyd was a very industrious and energetic man, and he became one of the substantial citizens of the community in which he made his home. He was highly respected by all who knew him, and died on his farm near Jonesboro, Tennessee, at an advanced age.<br>
The father of our subject also bore the name of William Cloyd, and was born near Jonesboro, March 22, 1786. Under his father's direction he learned the blacksmith trade, and after attaining his majority he was married in his native county to Miss Esther Neale. In 1814 they removed to Miami county, Ohio, where Mr. Cloyd worked at blacksmithing until he was enabled to purchase a farm of eighty acres. This was covered with timber, but he at once began to clear and improve it, and soon fertile fields yielded him good harvests. In October, 1828, he removed with his family to Tippecanoe county, and on the 16th of that month settled on Wea creek, on the quarter section of land which forms the eastern part our subject's farm. It was a tract of oak and hickory barrens. With characteristic energy he began its development, and made a good homestead upon which he spent his remaining days, his death occurring between the ages of fifty and sixty years. He was very industrious and enterprising, and his success was the well merited reward of his own labors. In politics he was a Democrat. His first wife, nee Esther Neale, was born in Tennessee, August 9, 1790, and was one of the children of Jesse Neale. Among her brothers and sisters were Nancy and Caleb Neale. She died in Miami county, Ohio, leaving four daughters, all born in Tennessee. Mr. Cloyd was again married, in Miami county, his second union being with Hannah Elmore, daughter of David and Phoebe (Pugh) Elmore. Her father was a pioneer farmer of Miami county, whither he removed from the Carolinas. By the second marriage of William Cloyd three children were born, David, William and Susan.<br>
John Cloyd, whose name begins this sketch, was born in Miami county, Ohio, near Troy, December 8, 1816, and when thirteen years of age came with his father to Tippecanoe county. The journey was made with teams and there was quite a large party of emigrants, eighteen wagons being used to accommodate them. The men were all armed, as the Indians were still numerous in this section of the country. They experienced considerable difficulty in crossing the rivers and swollen streams, but at length reached their destination in safety. In the party were David Elmore with his family, and two of his sons-in-law with their families. They all camped out every night near the roadside and thus traveled for two weeks, when they arrived in Tippecanoe county. John Cloyd assisted in driving the cattle and sheep, which they brought with them in considerable numbers. Here he was reared amid the wild scenes of the frontier, where civilization was just encroaching upon the wildness of a hitherto unimproved section. Lafayette then contained only two log cabins and two log stores. Mr. Cloyd had little opportunity to secure an education, attending a subscription school for three weeks, which was the extent of his privileges in that direction. He aided in the laborious task of developing new land, and at the age of twenty two years was married to Betsy Nicewander, December 16, 1838. Her parents were Joseph and Elizabeth Nicewander. The young couple began their domestic life upon a part of his father's farm, which land he cleared and improved, transforming it into rich fields. Four children came to bless the home, namely, Maria, William, Margaret and Louisa. The mother died in 1851, and in Clinton county, Indiana, February 8, 1854, Mr. Cloyd was again married, his second union being with Jane Bailey, who was born in Ohio, December of 1835.<br>
Her parents were Silas and Sarah (Trotter) Bailey. The former was a representative of an old colonial family of Virginia and Maryland, and was a pioneer of Clinton county, Indiana, his home being near Colfax. He died in Cleveland, Ohio, about 1851, when en route for the gold fields of California. His children were Nun, Jane, Thomas, Jehu, Dorothy and Henry. The children of Mr. and Mrs. Cloyd were Jesse, who died when about sixteen years of age; Henry, who died in infancy; Ritchie; Ellen; Thomas B.; Esther J.; Martha; and Annie. Again, Mr. Cloyd was called upon to mourn the loss of his wife, who died April 7, 1880, at the age of forty five years. She was a faithful member of the Christian church, and her well spent life won her the friendship of all with whom she came in contact.<br>
In his political views Mr. Cloyd is a Democrat, but has never sought office, always giving his time and attention to the improvement of his farm and property. Thus has he prospered. He first located on a part of his father's land, but after some years he was enabled to purchase the interests of the other heirs in the old homestead, and to-day he is the owner of four hundred acres in that tract. He has also made other purchases, and his landed possessions aggregated five hundred and sixty acres in Tippecanoe county, in addition to a farm of one hundred and sixty acres in Iowa. Some of this he has given to his children, but still retains possession of the old homestead of four hundred acres. He has also engaged quite extensively and successfully in stock raising, has paid high prices to secure the best grades of stock, and for several years has taken premiums at the county fairs for the best stock on exhibition there. Notwithstanding he has paid out forty thousand dollars in security debts for others, he is now numbered among the prosperous farmers of the county. He is truly a self made man, his success being the merited reward of his well directed labors, his enterprise and his capable management. His honesty is proverbial and he has the confidence of all with whom he has had dealings. He well deserves mention among the honored pioneers of the county, which has been his home for more than seventy years, and which owes not a little of its improvement in agricultural districts to his efforts.

<b>James Pattison Clute </b><br>
James Pattison Clute, of Battle Ground, Tippecanoe County, has been a resident of this county since the fall of 1838. He was born in Saratoga County, New York, near Saratoga Springs, February 19, 1830, a son of Walter and Almira (Pattison) Clute, both of whom died many years ago. He was reared in the family of James Pattison, his maternal grandfather, until about fifteen years of age, and was in his ninth year when Mr. Pattison came to Tippecanoe County, and settled one mile west of Battle Ground, on the farm now owned by Dr. H. D. Ridile, of Battle Ground. The surrounding country was in a state of nature, and wild animals, such as wolves and deer, roamed at large. Game of all kinds was in abundance. Wolf chases and deer hunts were the principal amusements of the early settler. The date of the Pattison family's arrival in the county was in October, 1838. Mr. Pattison married for his wife Miss Juda Akert, who was a representative of one of the early families of Western New York. She died many years before her husband. They brought with them to this county, eight children, as follows - Almira, the mother of our subject, who after the death of Mr. Clute, became the wife of Benjamin Birch; Mrs. Ann Franklin, now deceased; Elizabeth, now Mrs. Wolfer, of Battle Ground; Finetta, now Mrs. Shaw, of La Fayette; Juda, now Mrs. Snyder, of Ladoga, Indiana; William, Harmon and Abram, the last three deceased. Another daughter, Mrs. Caroline Veile, never became a resident of this county. She is still living at Saratoga, New York. Mr. Pattison made a homestead on the land where he first settled, where he lived many years, his first residence being a small log cabin, 14 x 18 feet, which was occupied by his family the winter following their arrival. Finally, on account of declining years, he sold his farm and bought a home at Battle Ground, where he remained until his death. James Pattison Clute, the subject of this sketch, is of Holland ancestry on his father's side, his ancestors having belonged to the colony which settled New Amsterdam, now New York, in the year 1614. When fifteen years old he began learning the carpenter's trade with John L. De Witt, with whom he remained one season, then continued his trade with William Klepinger for a time. In the spring of 1850 he began clerking in the general store of 'Squire Hamilton, and from that time has been constantly engaged in mercantile pursuits, with the exception of three years spent in the service of his country during the late war. He was married June 30, 1853, to Miss Louisiana Snyder, a daughter of Jacob Snyder, who settled in this county in the year 1843. The children born to Mr. and Mrs. Clute are all deceased. Mr. Clute enlisted in August, 1862, in Company G, Twentieth Indiana Infantry, his company at that time being at the front. He was offered the choice of official places in Company G, Sixty-third Indiana Infantry, which was then being raised, but he preferred to go to the front to taking the responsibility of a command without experience. He, with about sixty recruits, joined his regiment at Warrenton Junction, Virginia, and temporarily was assigned to Company K, under the command of Captain Brown. The second battle of Bull Run was then in progress, and with the other recruits he joined in the fight without arms, but they were soon armed by taking the muskets from their fallen comrades. He was in the battle of Fredericksburg, where his regiment took an active part, and was in the battle of Chancellorsville, where they captured the Twenty-third Georgia, which numbered more than their own men. On the defeat of the Eleventh Corps, and the falling back of the same, the Third Corps, to which his regiment belonged, was cut off from the rest of the army, rendering a midnight attack necessary. The regiment was withdrawn from the front, and facing to the rear, made a charge with bayonets, driving the enemy back and establishing communication. On account of illness, Mr. Clute did not participate in the battle of Gettysburg with his regiment. He accompanied his regiment to New York to assist in suppressing the draft riot in that city, and subsequently took part in the battles of Locust Grove, Mine Run, and the battle of the Wilderness. He received a gunshot wound in the head at the last mentioned battle, and was off duty but a short time, when he rejoined his regiment at the battle of Spottsylvania. He was also in the engagements of Cold Harbor, Talopotannia, Deep Bottom and Strawberry Plains. He took an active part in the siege of Petersburg, and was present at the surrender of Lee, and his last engagement was at Clear Hill, on the 9th of April, 1865. He received an honorable discharge at Arlington Heights, April 29, 1865, returning to his home with health much impaired. He was a gallant soldier, and while in the service fought bravely for his country. After the war he resumed his business, and has since been as actively engaged as his health would permit. Mr. Clute is a man of cordial manners and genial disposition, and a worthy citizen. He has always manifested a deep interest in the welfare of his township and county, and all worthy enterprises has his encouragement and support. He assisted in organizing Battle Ground Post, No. 464, G. A. R., of which he was the first Commander, and is now holding the office of Quartermaster of the Post. He is also a member of the Masonic fraternity, belonging to Battle Ground Lodge. In politics he is a Republican, and is a strong adherent to the principles of that party. Both he and his wife are worthy and active members of the Methodist church, and he was one of the organizers of the first Methodist church at Battle Ground. He also organized the first Sunday-school at Battle Ground, and most of the time since has been its superintendent.&nbsp;[Source: Biographical Record and Portrait Album of Tippecanoe County, Indiana, The Lewis Publishing Company, 1888, transcribed by Mary Saggio.]<br>

<b>Joseph Cochran </b><br>
Joseph Cochran, a farmer of Wea Township, was born in Ross County, Ohio, April 8, 1815. His paternal grandfather, who was of Scotch ancestry, moved from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, in Boone's time, thence to Ohio, where John Cochran, father of Joseph, was reared, and married to Mary Flood, a native of the State of Delaware, and probably of Irish descent. They lived in Ross County until their death, John Cochran dying in 1819, and his wife about 1880 at a very advanced age. Joseph, our subject, was brought up in his native county, and in 1836 immigrated to Tippecanoe County, Indiana, buying a quarter section of land the next year. The land was then partly fenced, and a small portion had been cultivated, and an old brick house was on the premises. In 1848 or '49, Mr. Cochran put up his present brick residence, and has occupied the place of his first purchase up to the present time, prospering as a well managing farmer should. He has about 460 acres of land in several tracts. The grounds about the residence are tastefully set off with natural groves, which were mere patches of underbrush when Mr. Cochran first settled here, and all the improvements are of a handsome and substantial character. Having lived here for more than half a century Mr. Cochran is very prominently identified with the growth of the county. He was married in this county in 1838, to Miss Maria Carr, a native of Fayette County, Ohio, and daughter of William and Elizabeth Carr, who settled in Tippecanoe County during its primitive days, on the land adjoining, west of Mr. Cochran's present farm. They lived in this county until their death. Mrs. Cochran died in 1860, and was buried in the old Thorp graveyard. Of the eleven children born to Mr. and Mrs. Cochran the following seven are living - William, in Wea Township; Martha Jane, wife of Cornelius Callahan, of La Fayette; Jackson and David, residents of Wea Township; Elizabeth; Nettie, wife of Wilbert Holmes, and Dora, who married Stephen Brady, and resides with her father. The deceased are - Charles, Mary and two who died in infancy unnamed. William was a soldier in the late war, serving in the One Hundred and Fiftieth Indiana Infantry. Since the war Mr. Cochran, the subject of the foregoing biography, has been a Republican.

<b>Moses Cole</b><br>
Moses Cole, one of the leading men of Tippecanoe County, residing on section 31, Washington Township, is a native of Lorain County, Ohio, born in the vicinity of Cleveland, a son of Peter and Mary (Bedford) Cole, who were natives of the State of New York, and of Dutch ancestry. The parents were reared in their native State, and at an early day came to Ohio. In 1831 they removed with their family to Champaign County, Ohio, where they lived some three years. In 1834 they came to Tippecanoe County, where they spent the first winter at Davison's Ferry. The following spring they settled in Washington Township, and for some time lived on rented land. The father then bought a tract of eighty acres in White County, Indiana, on which he lived several years, then sold his land, and removed to Terre Haute, where he died at the age of seventy-two years. His wife died at about the same age. Both are buried in Union cemetery, Washington Township, this county.

<b>Alexander H. Crouse</b><br>
Alexander H. Crouse is one of the substantial and respected citizens of Tippecanoe county, and a son of one of the honored pioneers. He belongs to the same family as Dr. Jerome Crouse, of Dayton, Indiana, in whose sketch may be found the genealogical history of the family. There is a tradition that three brothers of the name came from Germany at a very early day and located in Philadelphia, but more authentic records give proof that George Crouse, the great-grandfather of our subject, crossed the Atlantic to the United States in the first part of the eighteenth century and took up his abode in Cumberland county, Pennsylvania.<br>
Henry Crouse, the grandfather, was of sturdy Pennsylvania-Dutch stock, and was born in Cumberland county, July 6, 1768. In that locality he was married to Miss Hevison, who was born February 15, 1766, and their children were: Catherine, born May 20, 1792 ; Leah, born March 6, 1794; Henry, born August 1, 1796; Maria, born July 15, 1798; Simon, born July 25, 1802 ; John, born August 15, 1804; David, born September 18, 1808 ; Elizabeth, born. October 15, 1810; and Daniel, born November 20, 1814. About 1820 Henry Crouse, the father of this family, removed to Germantown, Ohio, and cleared a farm in that locality. In 1830 he became a resident of Marion county, Indiana, and purchased and cleared a section of land, including the site which was afterward chosen for the asylum for the insane, near Indianapolis. He died in the prime of life, owing to injuries sustained while felling a tree. He was a member of the German Reformed church.<br>
John W. Crouse, the father of our subject, was born April 15, 1805, in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, and during his youth accompanied his parents on their removal to Butler county, Ohio. He was married in Preble county, March 17, 1825, to Miss Eliza Christman, the marriage ceremony being performed by Rev. Bishop Kumler. The lady was born in Preble county, June 1, 1805, a daughter of Daniel and Magdaline (Oza) Christman. Her parents were both natives of Guilford county, North Carolina, the father born March 27, 1773, and the mother, December 8, 1776. They were among the early pioneers of Preble county, Ohio, where they reared their family of four sons and a daughter, namely: John, Eliza, Solomon, Jacob and Daniel. The sons spent the greater part of their lives in Preble county, where they were highly respected citizens. Daniel Christman entered land from the government and developed a good farm, at one time owning about three hundred acres. He was a straightforward, honorable man, a member of the United Brethren church, and died on the Ohio homestead when about eighty years of age.<br>
The family record of Mr. Christman, the grandfather of our subject, is as follows: He was born November 2, 1745, and died March 11, 1810. His wife Magdaline died June 7, 1800. Their children were: Margaret, born June 6, 1769; Jacob, August 9, 1770; John, September 17, 1771; Daniel, March 27, 1773; Mary B., April 3, 1774; Catherine, October 3, 1775; Peter, March 17, 1777; David, January 5, 1779; Mary E., February 27, 1782; Elizabeth, March 16, 1783; Roseanah, November 6, 1785; Susannah, September 6, 1787; Solomon, February 2, 1790; and Sophia, April 5, 1792. Jacob Christman, the great-grandfather of our subject, was born May 5, 1720. &nbsp;After their marriage, the parents of our subject took up their abode near Liberty, Union county, Indiana, in 1825. The father purchased land, also a sawmill. In the fall of 1828 he removed with his family to Wayne township, Tippecanoe county, Indiana, locating two miles from the present Crouse homestead. He bought one hundred and forty-two acres of land and entered a quarter section from the government, and thereon resided until his death, which occurred September 13, 1844. He cleared away the timber, turned the first furrows upon the prairie land, and developed a good farming property of three hundred acres, the greater part of which he placed under a high state of cultivation. He and his wife were both members of the United Brethren church, in which he served as class-leader and held other offices. He assisted in building a number of churches, contributed liberally to their support, and was very active in advancing the work of his denomination. In politics he was a Whig, and was at one time a candidate for state senator. He was a loyal and valued citizen, a substantial, practical farmer and a straightforward, reliable business man. His wife died March 26, 1883, at the age of seventy-eight years. She had been a widow for many years and had depended upon her son Alexander to manage the farm and business affairs in 7 her old age. Her children were Mary A., born October 5, 1826; Alexander Hamilton; Daniel Franklin, born June 11, 1837, and died July 11, 1866; and Mary A., who became the wife of James W. Stewart and died March 23, 1874.<br>
Alexander Hamilton Crouse was born on the homestead farm in Union county, Indiana, October 23, 1828, and was only six months old when brought by his parents to Tippecanoe county, so that he was reared amid the pioneer homes and scenes of this locality. He pursued his education in a log school-house, made of round poles, with puncheons for seats and constructed with the sharp edge uppermost, so that the children would not get lazy. In one end of the building was an old-fashioned stick chimney, and a back-log ten feet long could be put in the huge fireplace! For a window a log was removed and the aperture covered with greased paper. Between the ages of six and fifteen years Mr. Crouse attended that school through the winter season, with the exception of short intervals spent in a school of little better grade, near Odell. When he was a small boy his father instructed him in practical business methods, and he began to learn how to buy young cattle, being encouraged by his father, who gave him the money and taught him to know the points of good stock. He was also early inured to the labors of the fields, and when only nine years old cultivated thirty-five acres of corn. When he was sixteen years of age his father died, and the care and management of the farm devolved upon him. It was a great responsibility for a youth of his age, but he performed the work manfully and nobly, being assisted by the wise advice, counsel and encouragement of his devoted mother.<br>
As the years passed, his thrift and enterprise brought him increased wealth, and following the teachings of his father he became a prosperous cattle dealer. He was a good trader, and accumulated a handsome property. He remained at home with his mother until after her death, and was therefore not married until late in life. Some time after losing his mother he saw a Kentucky lady in whom he became much interested, and five years later they were married, in Hardin county, that state, June 24, 1894. She was in her maidenhood Miss Tee P. Humphrey. Their wedding was celebrated about three o'clock on Sunday afternoon, in a beautiful chestnut grove on the Humphrey homestead, Rev. Felix Humphrey, her brother, performing the ceremony in the presence of a large concourse of the best people of the county, more than twelve hundred being present. The bride ;was twenty-two years of age, the bridegroom sixty-five years. On their return to Indiana they gave a large reception to the many friends and neighbors of Mr. Crouse, over six hundred people being royally entertained. Their children were John Thomas, who was born April 26, 1895, and died in infancy; William Alexander, born March 24, 1896; and Mary Magdalene, born October 7, 1898. Mrs. Crouse was born in Hardin county, Kentucky, March 25, 1872, a daughter of Thomas and Arminda (Royalty) Humphrey. Her father was a son of Samuel and Drusilla (Haywood) Humphrey, the former born in Hardin county, his father being Samuel Humphrey, Sr., who left his Virginia home and became one of the pioneers of Kentucky, making his home there among the Indians. The grandmother of Mrs. Crouse, Mrs. Drusilla Humphrey, was the daughter of a prominent official of Hardin county, who had Indian blood in his veins, and more remote members of the family served as chiefs of the Shawnee Indians. It is claimed that a vast amount of land in Kentucky belongs by right to this branch of the family. The children of Samuel and Drusilla Humphrey were Sallie, John, Lydia, Samuel, William Wesley, Thomas, Rachel and Mahala. The last named died in early womanhood. Mr. Humphrey was a substantial farmer of Hardin county and a good citizen. In politics he was a Republican, and died in his native state in middle life.<br>
Thomas Humphrey, father of Mrs. Crouse, was born in Hardin county, March 12, 1827, was a farmer by occupation and when about twenty years of age married Arminda Royalty, who was born in Hardin county, July 1, 1832, a daughter of Daniel and Annie (Saunders) Royalty. Her father was born in Washington county, Kentucky, and was a son of David Royalty, one of the pioneers of Kentucky. Annie Saunders was a daughter of Thomas and Sally Saunders, and her father was a Kentucky pioneer, who served through the Revolutionary war under General Washington. He was a very strong man and weighed two hundred pounds when he entered the army, but was wounded in battle, which rendered him a cripple for life. His parents lived near a battle-field, and the window glass in their house was shattered by the firing. After leaving the army Mr. Royalty took up his residence in Washington county, Kentucky, where he spent his remaining days. His children were Annie, Isaac, Rebecca, Hannah and several daughters whose names are forgotten. Daniel Royalty was a shoemaker in Hardin county, Kentucky, where he also owned land, being one of the substantial citizens of that locality. He removed to that place soon after his marriage and there made his home until his death. His children were Sarah, Thomas, Jane, Rebecca, Catherine, Mary A. and Arminda. After their marriage Thomas Humphrey and his wife located at the head-waters of Mill creek, where he purchased a farm and spent the remainder of his life, while some of his children yet remain at that place. He and his wife were the parents of the following named: Felix, Thomas, Missouri, John W., Isaac F. and Wiatt W. (twins), Mary, Christian D. and Tee P. Mr. Humphrey died December 22, 1894, at the age of sixty-seven years, a member of the Baptist church, in which he had served as clerk and moderator. He had a common-school education, was an industrious, energetic man, trustworthy in business, and with his family a kind and affectionate husband and father. His widow is now living with her daughter, Mrs. Alexander H. Crouse. She, too, is a member of the Baptist church, in good standing, and all of her children are connected with the same denomination. In politics the family are stanch Republicans. The Humphreys are of the old and respected families of Kentucky, well known for their sterling worth and excellent traits of character. Rev. Felix Humphrey, a brother of Mrs. Crouse, was educated in Garnettsville, Meade county, Kentucky, and is now an ordained minister in the Baptist church.<br>
Mr. Crouse, whose name introduces this review, is accounted one of the prominent, diligent and prosperous agriculturists of Tippecanoe county, the greater part of his attention being devoted to his farming interests, which he manages with marked ability and success. He cast his ballot for Abraham Lincoln and for many years was a stanch Republican, but is now a Democrat and free-silver man. For eight and a half years he served as a justice of the peace, during which time he tried many cases and was always noted for his moderation and justice. His good common sense also played a part in his official service and was manifest in the settlement of many cases out of court, through arbitration between the litigants. He is a man of sterling rectitude of character, and his word is as good as his bond. Like his father, he was at one time a candidate for state senator, and it is claimed that he originated and suggested the present liquor laws of the state of Indiana. He has traveled quite extensively, visiting the principal cities of the United States, and in 1869 he went abroad, spending some time in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France, Germany, Spain and Turkey, viewing the many points of modern and historic interest in those lands. Socially, he is connected with the Odd Fellows society and has passed all the chairs in the lodge and also belongs to the encampment. He is a man of kindly disposition, generous nature and courteous manner, and is one of the most highly respected and popular residents of Tippecanoe county.

<b>Jerome H. Crouse, M.D.</b><br>
For nearly sixty years the Crouses, father and son, have been engaged in the practice of medicine in Dayton, Tippecanoe county, and have been prominently connected with all local progressive movements. They have been on the side of temperance, the father being associated with the old Wash-ingtonian Society and the son identified with the order of Good Templars. Both have been devoted to the Republican party, the father having formerly been a Whig, and later on of the foremost champions of the party which succeeded it, voting for John C. Fremont. His services on behalf of his party were recognized in his being elected to the state senate, in which he ably represented the public.<br>
In following back the ancestry of the subject of this article it is learned that he is of German extraction on the paternal side. His great-grandfather, George Crouse, come to America some time in the early part of the eighteenth century, and settled in Cumberland county, Pennsylvania. Henry Crouse, the grandfather, was born July 6, 1768, in Cumberland county, and married a lady of the same locality, Salome Hevison, she having been born February 15, 1766. Their children were as follows: Caroline, born May 20, 1792; Leah, March 6, 1794; Henry, August 1, 1796; Maria, July 15, 1798 Simon, July 25, 1802; John, August 15, 1804; David, September 18, 1808; Elizabeth, October 15, 1810; and Daniel, November to, 1814. Henry Crouse removed to Germantown, Ohio, about 1820, and cleared a farm in that locality. In 1830 he settled in Marion county, Indiana, on land which was afterward chosen as the site of the asylum for the insane, near Indianapolis. He bought and cleared a quarter section of land there and spent the rest of his days on that homestead. He died while still in the prime of life, owing to injuries received from a falling tree, which he had cut down. He was a member of the German Reformed church.<br>
Dr. David H. Crouse, father of our subject, was a young man when-he accompanied the family to Marion county, in 1830, and for ten years thereafter he assisted in the management of the property which his senior had purchased there. He then came to Dayton and bought land, gradually extending his possessions until he had about five hundred acres. For the most part, he purchased his farms from the original owners, and having greatly improved his special homestead, in 1860 he built a substantial two-story brick residence upon it, and within its hospitable walls his son, our subject, has dwelt for many years. In 1843 he was graduated in the Jefferson Medical College, of Philadelphia, and had previously studied with his brother, Daniel B., a successful early practitioner of Dayton and vicinity. He at once established himself in practice in Dayton and for more than two-score years was a leading physician in this portion of the county. In the first years of his practice he was obliged to ride to distant places, as doctors were few and the population very scattering. For years he was a faithful member of the Presbyterian church and officiated as an elder in the same.<br>
For his first wife, Dr. David H. Crouse chose Rachel, daughter of Frederick and Catherine Gelwicks, of Franklin county, Pennsylvania. The Gel-wicks were of sturdy Dutch stock, and have been represented in this country since colonial days. The homestead owned by Frederick Gelwick was located some eight miles northwest of Chambersburg, and had been handed down from father to son for several generations. They were substantial farmers and were zealous members of the German Reformed church. The old Gelwick farm, a place of about three hundred acres, has never passed from the family and is now owned by a grandson of Frederick Gelwick. His children were John, Susan, Elizabeth, Mrs. Hartzell, Frederick and Rachel. To Dr. Crouse and wife Rachel several children were born, and those who lived to maturity were Salome C, who married Elijah Earl, Victoria V., wife of V. S. Burton; and Jerome H. Subsequently to the death of his first wife, in 1845, Dr. D. H. Crouse married Rachel Baker, by whom he had two children who survived: Meigs V., a former pastor of a Presbyterian church, and now the superintendent of a children's home in Cincinnati, Ohio; and Elda. The third wife of the Doctor, Mr&amp;. Lydia Peter (nee Leibenguth) survived him, and is still living. His death took place December 7, 1884, at his old home, where his active and useful career had been chiefly spent.<br>
The birth of Dr. Jerome H. Crouse occurred December 30, 1843, in Dayton, Indiana. He attended Wabash College after he had finished a common-school education, but the civil war broke in rudtly upon his studies. He enlisted at eighteen years of age in the Tenth Indiana Battery, light artillery, under Captain J. B. Cox, as a private, for three years or as long as the war should last. He served under the great leaders, Buell and Rosecrans, took part in the battles of Pittsburg Landing, Stone River, Chickamauga, Corinth and the great four-months struggle known as the Atlanta campaign. After the fall of Atlanta he and his battery were placed in charge of a gunboat on the Tennessee river, and he was honorably discharged at Nashville, Tennessee, February 1, 1865. His service was a most creditable one, and he was relied upon by his superior officers, who knew that he would always be found at his post of duty, whatever happened. Though he participated in the numerous hard-fought battles and campaigns in which his battery took part, he escaped capture and wounds, save once, when he was accidentally injured in the left shoulder. For some time he was connected with Wilder's brigade and was sent on several raids in the neighborhood of Atlanta. Since the war he has had special affection for the Grand Army of the Republic, and has been commander of Elliott Post No. 160, of Dayton, and was one of its charter members.<br>
When he returned from the south the Doctor commenced the study of medicine under his father's guidance, and in 1867 graduated in Rush Medical College in Chicago. The same year he embarked in practice in this, his native town, and in 1868 took a special course in Jefferson College, Philadelphia. For three decades he had been constantly occupied in his professional duties, enjoying a large and lucrative practice. He is the possessor of an extensive library, embracing not only the finest works on everything connected with medical science but also on general subjects, standard literature, etc. He is a past master of Dayton Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, is now serving as secretary of the same and also has attained the Scottish Rite degree in the order. Since the death of his honored father he has been an elder in the Presbyterian church, and takes an earnest interest in the spread of Christianity.<br>
