TYPOGRAPHERS,CINCINNATI, O.TRUSTEES' PREFACE.THE marked increase of interest in
the Sunday School work within the past few years, has
produced an unprecedented activity in the publication of
Sunday School music books. Many of these, by reason of the
transient character of the music and words employed, have
proved short-lived. The schools soon tired of them, and
demanded new books, which, in turn, ran their brief course
to give place to others. Besides the expense involved in
these frequent changes of music books, a worse evil,
perhaps, was the inculcation of unscriptural sentiments
which many of the popular songs contained, and the
formation of wrong musical tastes. It was this state of
things that led the General Convention, assembled at
Louisville, in October, 1880, to adopt the following
recommendation of a committee appointed to consider, and
report on, the revision of the Hymnal:"It is,
furthermore, the judgment of your Committee that the
preparation and publication, under the supervision of the
Hymn Book Committee, of a Sunday School Hymnal, with a view
of adjusting the singing in our Sunday Schools, as far as
possible, to that in the church, and to prevent the
frequent changes in music books, which is a source of great
expense to our schools, would meet with a ready sale and
serve a most desirable end; and we recommend the
publication of such a book by said committee."The
book which we now send forth is the result of an effort to
carry out this recommendation of the General Convention. As
soon as the trustees had performed the previous duty of
revising the Hymnal for the churches, they entered into a
contract with the Christian Publishing Company, of St.
Louis, by which said company assumed the financial
responsibility of issuing such a book, and will pay a
royalty on each book sold, which will go into the treasury
of the General Convention as a mission fund.The
trustees appointed a committee of well-known brethren, in
whose sound judgment and musical taste they had confidence,
to select such music and words as would meet the end had in
view by the Convention, and thereby greatly improve the
character of the singing in our Sunday Schools. The result
of their labors we now present to the brotherhood, and to
the Christian public generally, hoping that it may meet
with a generous reception, and succeed in filling a want
that has long been felt by the Sunday Schools of the
land.Our thanks are due to the few music publishers
who have generously allowed us the use of such of their
pieces as we desired, free of charge. Most of the music
herein contained, however, has been paid for, much of it at
a high rate. We have not spared any necessary expense to
make a superior book.It is the purpose, both of the
trustees and publishers, to make such gradual improvements
from time to time, in the book, as may be necessary to keep
it in the front line of Sunday School Hymnals. We now
invoke upon the work the blessing of Him, in whose honor
and for whose praise it has been prepared.R. M. BISHOP,Chairman Board of
Trustees.COMPILER'S PREFACE.THE undersigned having been charged
with the responsible task of carrying out the
recommendation of the General Convention, in the
compilation of a Sunday School Hymnal, have spared no labor
nor pains to produce such a book as would elevate the
standard of Sunday School music among us, and prove of
permanent value to our schools. We have steadily kept in
view the character of the music and the sentiment of the
words, and have endeavored, as far as possible, to rule out
whatever is objectionable. Especially have we aimed to
secure a class of songs that would last, and give our schools a long rest
from the expense and inconvenience of procuring new books.
We call attention to the following features of this
book:1. Each piece of music has its time-signature,
or movement marks, by which the leader may determine the
time in which it should be sung.2. The words, in
every case, will be found between the music staves, thus
enabling the singer to see the notes and the music at the
same time. This will be found of great service in learning
new pieces, and also in promoting the correct singing of
familiar pieces.3. The music is written out in full,
avoiding "omits," and "repeats," which are so
confusing.4. The pieces are so arranged on the
pages, that no leaf need be turned in the singing of any
song.5. The department of "Songs for Special
Occasions," will be found to contain a number of pieces of
rare merit, adapted to a variety of special
occasions.6. While we have sought, on the one hand,
to avoid light and frivolous songs, which have nothing to
commend them but a merry jingle, we have aimed, on the
other hand, to select nothing, which is so complex in its
music, or advanced in its sentiment, as to be out of reach
of children and ordinary singers.7. The question of
cost has not influenced us in the selection of songs, only
as between pieces of equal merit. The publishers authorized
us to get the very best songs published; and hence our
selections were made first, and
the question of cost considered afterwards.Our work
has not been done by correspondence, but by many days of
united, patient labor. The Committee takes pleasure in
acknowledging the very valuable services of J. P. Powell,
whose labors on our Church Hymnal have been recognized and
appreciated by the brotherhood. Having been appointed as
musical editor of the Sunday School Hymnal, he met with us
in our several meetings, and gave us the benefit of his
large experience and musical taste. To him we are largely
indebted for the special features of the book above
mentioned. We also acknowledge, gratefully, the help
received from numerous brethren, whose suggestions have
aided us in ascertaining what songs have stood the test of
actual service in the Sunday School.With a vast
amount of material to choose from, we have earnestly sought
to make a book that would combine the best songs of the
various books to which we have had access. We now send
forth the result of our labors, not as a faultless book,
but as one containing a larger number of excellent songs
adapted to the Sunday School than any other book known to
us. For it we bespeak the generous patronage of the
brotherhood, and on it we implore the blessing of God, to
the end that its sweet melodies and inspiring sentiments
may swell the volume of praise arising from earth to
heaven, and may guide many young hearts to Him, who is "the
Way, the Truth, and the Life."J. H.

among us yet under the rod,Who knows not the
pardoning mercy of God?O, bring to him humbly the
heart in its pride;O, haste while he's waiting and

consternation, 'twas the hand upon the wall.Chorus.'Tis the hand of God that
is writing on the wall,'Tis the hand of God that is
writing on the wall;Shall the record be, "Found
waiting," or shall it be, "Found trusting,"While
that hand is writing on the wall?2. See the brave captive Daniel--as he stood
before the throng,And rebuked the haughty monarch
for his mighty deeds of wrong;As he read out the
writing--'twas the doom of one and all,For the
kingdom now was finished, said the hand upon the
wall.3. See the faith,
zeal, and courage that would dare to do the
right,Which the Spirit gave to Daniel--this the
secret of his might;In his home in Judea, or a
captive in the hall,He understood the writing of his
God upon the wall.4. So
our deeds are recorded--there's a Hand that's writing

sharethEvery burden, every fear.2. Yes, o'er me, o'er me he
watcheth,Ceaseless watcheth, night and
day;Yes, e'en me, e'en me he snatchethFrom
the perils of the way.3.
Yes, for me he standeth pleadingAt the mercy-seat
above;Ever for me interceding,Constant in
untiring love.4. Yes, in
me, in me he dwelleth;I in him, and he in
me;And my empty soul he filleth,Here and
thro' eternity.By permission.No. 136. "I AM
THE VINE.""For without me
ye can do nothing."--JOHN
xv:1-10.K. S.KNOWLES SHAW.1. I am the vine, and ye are the
branches,Bear precious fruit for Jesus
to-day;The branch that in me no fruit ever
beareth,Jesus hath said, "He taketh
away."Chorus."I am the vine, and ye are
the branches,I am the vine, be faithful and
true;Ask what ye will, your prayer shall be
granted;The Father loved me, so I have loved
thee."2. Now ye are
clean, thro' words I have spoken,Abiding in me, much
fruit ye shall bear;"Dwelling in thee, my promise
unbroken,Glory in heaven with me ye shall
share."3. Yes, by your
fruits the world is to know you,Walking in love as
children of day;Follow your Guide, he passed on
before you,Leading to realms of glorious
day.No. 137.
WHEN SHALL WE MEET
AGAIN?"He hath prepared for
them a city."--HEB.
xi:16.Dr. L. MASON.1. When shall we meet again,Meet ne'er to
sever?When will peace wreathe her chainRound
us forever?Our hearts will ne'er reposeSafe
from each blast that blows,In this dark vale of
woes--Never--no, never!2. When shall love freely flow,Pure as
life's river?When shall sweet friendship
glow,Changeless forever?Where joys celestial
thrill,Where bliss each heart shall fill,And
fears of parting chill,Never--no, never!3. Up to that world of
lightTake us, dear Savior;May we all there
unite,Happy forever:Where kindred spirits
dwell,There may our music swell,And time our
joys dispel,Never--no, never!No. 138. TO

a better country, that is an heavenly."--HEB.
xi:16.Mrs. M. B. C. SLADE.Dr. A. B. EVERETT.1. We are marching to Canaan, thro' the desert
vast,And the Lord, with cloud by day,And with
light of his presence, till the night is past,Is
shining o'er the way.Chorus.To
Jordan when we come,As we cross the billow's
foam,Come thou o'er its wave, our Guide to
be.We are coming, coming, lead us safely
home,Till the shining land we see.2. Though we thirst in the desert,
thou art ever nigh,Giving waters, clear and
sweet;If we faint on the journey, manna from on
highIs falling at our feet.3. Green and cool Elim's palm trees, where we
peaceful rest,Dewy shelter sweet and
fair;There our Shepherd has borne us, on his gentle
breast,So loving is his care.4. When the swelling of Jordan sounds
upon the shore,When its parted waves we
see,We will sing glad hosannas, joyful passing
o'er;We're coming unto thee.By
permission.No. 139.
HURSLEY."In him was life,
and the life was the light of men."--JOHN
i:4.J. KEBLE.W. H. MONK--Arr.1. Sun of my soul! thou Savior dear,It is
not night if thou be near;O may no earth-born cloud
ariseTo hide thee from thy servant's
eyes.2. When soft the
dews of kindly sleepMy wearied eyelids gently
steep,Be my last thought--how sweet to
restForever on my Savior's breast!3. Abide with me from morn till
eve,For without thee I can not live;Abide
with me when night is nigh,For without thee I dare
not die.4. Be near to
bless me when I wake,Ere through the world my way I
take;Abide with me till, in thy love,I lose
myself in heaven above.SONGS FOR SPECIAL

with thy counsel."--PS.
lxxiii:24.W. WILLIAMS.Anon.1. Guide me, O thou great
Jehovah,Pilgrim through this barren land;I am
weak, but thou art mighty,Hold me with thy powerful
hand.Bread of heaven, bread of heaven,Feed me
till I want no more.2.
Open thou the crystal fountainWhence the healing
waters flow;Let the fiery, cloudy pillarLead
me all my journey through;Strong Deliverer, strong
Deliverer,Be thou still my strength and
shield.3. When I tread

crystal stream that floweth by,Shall quench my
thirst when I am dry.From alcohol and poison
free,My drink shall pure cold water be;The
crystal stream that floweth by,Shall quench my
thirst2. The drink I'll
use will not be beer,For even that may bring the
woe,The bitter sorrows, wound and tear,And
lay its tens of thousands low.3. The drink I'll use will not be
ale,However harmless it may seem;That, too,
may cause the sad, sad wail,And sink beyond hope's
cheering gleam.4. The
drink I'll use will not be gin,Nor rum, nor brandy,
nor old rye;For if I do, how dread the
thought,The drunkard's death I too may
die.By permission.No. 144.

liberty,Of thee I sing;Land where my fathers
died;Land of the pilgrim's pride;From every
mountain sideLet freedom ring.2. My native country!
thee,Land of the noble free,Thy name I
love;I love thy rocks and rills,Thy woods and
templed hills;My heart with rapture
thrillsLike that above.3. Let music swell the breeze,And ring from

AND WATCHING FOR ME."For so
an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into
the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus
Christ."--2 PET.
i:11.KNOWLES SHAW1.
When my final farewell to the world I have said,And
gladly lie down to my rest;When softly the watchers
shall say "He is dead,"And fold my pale hands o'er
my breast;And when, with my glorified vision, at
lastThe walls of "That City" I see,Will any
one then at the beautiful gate,Be waiting and
watching for me?Chorus.Be
waiting and watching, be waiting for me;Be waiting
and watching, be watching for me;Will any one then
at the beautiful gate,Be waiting and watching for
me?2. There are little
ones glancing about in my path,In want of a friend
and a guide;There are dear little eyes looking up
into mine,Whose tears might be easily
dried;But Jesus may beckon the children
awayIn the midst of their grief and their
glee--Will any one then at the beautiful
gate,Be waiting and watching for me?3. There are old and forsaken who
linger awhileIn homes which their dearest have
left;And a few gentle words or an action of
loveMay cheer their sad spirits bereft;But
the Reaper is near to the long-standing corn,The
weary will soon be set free--Will any one then at
the beautiful gate,Be waiting and watching for
me?4. O should I be
brought there by the bountiful graceOf him who
delights to forgive;Though I bless not the weary
about in my path,Pray only for self while I
live,--Methinks I should mourn o'er my sinful
neglect,If sorrow in heaven could be,Should
no one I love at the beautiful gate,Be waiting and
watching for me.Be waiting and watching, be waiting for
me;Be waiting and watching, be watching for
me;Should no one I love at the beautiful gate, Be waiting and watching for me.By
permission.No. 146.

unity."--PS.

welcome,We welcome you, dear friends,In this
our opening lay;Welcome, welcome,
welcome,Welcome here this festal day.Duet.1. Many are the sorrows,
many are the tears,Many are the joys, and many are
the fearsThat have crossed our pathway since we last
did meet,But we've come again, our kindred and our
friends to greet.2. Many
are the conflicts, many are the snares,Many are the
trials, and many are the caresThat we've borne
through Jesus, since we last did meet,But we're here
again, our brethren and our friends to greet.3. Many are the pleasures that we
here shall share,Many are the treasures we must
homeward bear,That we may be true till we the Master
meet,When we'll come again, our loved ones and our
friends to greet.By permission.No. 147.

securely fold you,God be with you till we meet
again.Chorus.Till we meet, till we meet
again,Till we meet at Jesus' feet;Till we
meet, till we meet again,God be with you till we
meet again.2. God be
with you till we meet again;'Neath his wings
securely hide you;Daily manna still divide
you,God be with you till we meet again.3. God be with you till we meet
again;When life's perils thick confound
you,Put his arms unfailing round you,God be
with you till we meet again.4. God be with you till we meet again;Keep
love's banner floating o'er you;Smite death's
threatening waves before you,God be with you till we
meet again.By permission.. M.

HE
</SPAN>
 marked increase of interest in
the Sunday School work within the past few years, has
produced an unprecedented activity in the publication of
Sunday School music books. Many of these, by reason of the
transient character of the music and words employed, have
proved short-lived. The schools soon tired of them, and
demanded new books, which, in turn, ran their brief course
to give place to others. Besides the expense involved in
these frequent changes of music books, a worse evil,
perhaps, was the inculcation of unscriptural sentiments
which many of the popular songs contained, and the
formation of wrong musical tastes. It was this state of
things that led the General Convention, assembled at
Louisville, in October, 1880, to adopt the following
recommendation of a committee appointed to consider, and
report on, the revision of the Hymnal:
</P>
<P class="pgh">
"It is,
furthermore, the judgment of your Committee that the
preparation and publication, under the supervision of the
Hymn Book Committee, of a Sunday School Hymnal, with a view
of adjusting the singing in our Sunday Schools, as far as
possible, to that in the church, and to prevent the
frequent changes in music books, which is a source of great
expense to our schools, would meet with a ready sale and
serve a most desirable end; and we recommend the
publication of such a book by said committee."
</P>
<P class="pgh">
The
book which we now send forth is the result of an effort to
carry out this recommendation of the General Convention. As
soon as the trustees had performed the previous duty of
revising the Hymnal for the churches, they entered into a
contract with the Christian Publishing Company, of St.
Louis, by which said company assumed the financial
responsibility of issuing such a book, and will pay a
royalty on each book sold, which will go into the treasury
of the General Convention as a mission fund.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
The
trustees appointed a committee of well-known brethren, in
whose sound judgment and musical taste they had confidence,
to select such music and words as would meet the end had in
view by the Convention, and thereby greatly improve the
character of the singing in our Sunday Schools. The result
of their labors we now present to the brotherhood, and to
the Christian public generally, hoping that it may meet
with a generous reception, and succeed in filling a want
that has long been felt by the Sunday Schools of the
land.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
Our thanks are due to the few music publishers
who have generously allowed us the use of such of their
pieces as we desired, free of charge. Most of the music
herein contained, however, has been paid for, much of it at
a high rate. We have not spared any necessary expense to
make a superior book.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
It is the purpose, both of the
trustees and publishers, to make such gradual improvements
from time to time, in the book, as may be necessary to keep
it in the front line of Sunday School Hymnals. We now
invoke upon the work the blessing of Him, in whose honor
and for whose praise it has been prepared.

<P class="pgh">

<SPAN class="smallcaps">
HE
</SPAN>
 undersigned having been charged
with the responsible task of carrying out the
recommendation of the General Convention, in the
compilation of a Sunday School Hymnal, have spared no labor
nor pains to produce such a book as would elevate the
standard of Sunday School music among us, and prove of
permanent value to our schools. We have steadily kept in
view the character of the music and the sentiment of the
words, and have endeavored, as far as possible, to rule out
whatever is objectionable. Especially have we aimed to
secure a class of songs that would 
<I>last,
</I>
 and give our schools a long rest
from the expense and inconvenience of procuring new books.
We call attention to the following features of this
book:
</P>
<P class="pgh">
1. Each piece of music has its time-signature,
or movement marks, by which the leader may determine the
time in which it should be sung.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
2. The words, in
every case, will be found between the music staves, thus
enabling the singer to see the notes and the music at the
same time. This will be found of great service in learning
new pieces, and also in promoting the correct singing of
familiar pieces.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
3. The music is written out in full,
avoiding "omits," and "repeats," which are so
confusing.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
4. The pieces are so arranged on the
pages, that no leaf need be turned in the singing of any
song.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
5. The department of "Songs for Special
Occasions," will be found to contain a number of pieces of
rare merit, adapted to a variety of special
occasions.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
6. While we have sought, on the one hand,
to avoid light and frivolous songs, which have nothing to
commend them but a merry jingle, we have aimed, on the
other hand, to select nothing, which is so complex in its
music, or advanced in its sentiment, as to be out of reach
of children and ordinary singers.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
7. The question of
cost has not influenced us in the selection of songs, only
as between pieces of equal merit. The publishers authorized
us to get the very best songs published; and hence our
selections were made 
<I>first,
</I>
 and
the question of cost considered afterwards.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
Our work
has not been done by correspondence, but by many days of
united, patient labor. The Committee takes pleasure in
acknowledging the very valuable services of J. P. Powell,
whose labors on our Church Hymnal have been recognized and
appreciated by the brotherhood. Having been appointed as
musical editor of the Sunday School Hymnal, he met with us
in our several meetings, and gave us the benefit of his
large experience and musical taste. To him we are largely
indebted for the special features of the book above
mentioned. We also acknowledge, gratefully, the help
received from numerous brethren, whose suggestions have
aided us in ascertaining what songs have stood the test of
actual service in the Sunday School.
</P>
<P class="pgh">
With a vast
amount of material to choose from, we have earnestly sought
to make a book that would combine the best songs of the
various books to which we have had access. We now send
forth the result of our labors, not as a faultless book,
but as one containing a larger number of excellent songs
adapted to the Sunday School than any other book known to
us. For it we bespeak the generous patronage of the
brotherhood, and on it we implore the blessing of God, to
the end that its sweet melodies and inspiring sentiments
may swell the volume of praise arising from earth to
heaven, and may guide many young hearts to Him, who is "the
Way, the Truth, and the Life."

incident suggested the song below to its author.]
