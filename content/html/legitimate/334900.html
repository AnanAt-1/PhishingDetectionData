<P>
Not every Anglican diocese worldwide has a Web page yet.
The web page that you are now reading is operated by the <A href="http://justus.anglican.org/soaj.html">Society
of Archbishop Justus</a> as a placeholder until The Diocese of Benin
is prepared to have its own page. The Society
operates the domain <a href="http://anglican.org/domain/">ANGLICAN.ORG</a>
in trust for the Anglican Communion; <tt>benin.anglican.org</tt>,
a subdomain issued to the Diocese of Benin, is part of what is being held in trust.<P>If you represent the staff of The Diocese of Benin
and would like to learn how to take ownership of the name
<tt>benin.anglican.org</tt> 
please see <a href="http://anglican.org/domain/">http://anglican.org/domain/</a>

and read about the naming plan.<P>

If you are looking for an official home page for The Diocese of Benin
we do not know of one. Should you find it before we do,
<A href="http://anglicansonline.org/forms/submit.html">please do 
let us know about it.</a> Sometimes <A href="http://anglicansonline.org/">Anglicans Online</a> lists unofficial diocesan pages.
