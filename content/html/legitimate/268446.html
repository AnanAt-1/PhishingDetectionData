    ``Almost a fifth of college students spend more that 20 hours a week on
    the Internet, reports <i>CyberPsychology and Behaviour</i>, a bimonthly
    journal. Jonathan J. Kandell of the University of Maryland Counseling
    Center quotes experts who say that this amount of time qualifies as
    addiction. Kandell also cites a New York University study that
    correlates high student Internet use with doubled rates of academic
    dismissals. [...] <br>

    In addition to Internet gambling, activities that can lend themselves to
    addictive of compulsive behaviour include playing computer games, being
    a junkie of unmoderated newsgroups and chat rooms, surfing the web,
    browsing for cool tools, cracking system security for amusement and
    perhaps even programming itself - which seems to inspire compulsive
    behaviour in certain individuals.'' <br> <br>

</pre>

<p> The old <a href = "pg.lisp">single-file version</a> is still available,
but is not updated. 
</li>

<li> <p> Some <a href = "cl-bench.tar.gz">Common Lisp performance
     benchmarking code</a>. Includes the Gabriel benchmarks, mathematical
     functions, bignum-intensive operations, CLOS test, hashtable
     exercising, read-line exercising, various operations on arrays,
     strings and bitvectors, and performance-intensive kernels such as CRC
     and DEFLATE. Updated 2004-08-02. </p> </li>


<li> <p> A <a href = "cpc.lisp">CMUCL interface</a> to the <a href =
"http://docs.sun.com:80/ab2/coll.40.6/REFMAN3E/@Ab2PageView/47198?Ab2Lang=C&Ab2Enc=iso-8859-1">
CPU Performance Counters</a> library available with Solaris 8. Allows you
to collect data on instruction/cycle counts, cache misses, branch
mispredictions etc. Version 0.5, updated 2004-01-03. </p> </li>

<li> <p> A <a href = "cmucl-trampoline.c">trampoline program</a> for
writing shell scripts in <a href = "http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">CMUCL</a>.
Dated 2001-12-04. Lets you write code like </p>

<pre class="code">
   #!/usr/bin/cmucl-trampoline \

   !#

   (format t "Hello, world!~%")
</pre> </li>


<li> <p> A <a href = "tcp-forwarder.lisp">tcp-forwarder</a> program, which
redirects TCP connections to another port on another machine. Uses CMUCL's
SERVE-EVENT facility to handle several concurrent connections without using
multithreading. </p> </li>


<li> <p> An <a href = "ssl-cmucl.lisp">interface to SSL streams</a> for
     CMUCL. Uses FFI calls to the <a href =
     "http://www.OpenSSL.org/">OpenSSL</a> libraries, and is based on the
     CMUCL fd-stream implementation. Both client and server support (using
     PEM-encoded X.509 certificates) is included. Version 0.3 dated
     2003-10-10, under GNU LGPL. </p> </li>


<li> <p> An <a href = "xmlrpc.lisp">adaptation</a> of Chris Double's
XML-RPC client implementation (originally for Corman Lisp) to CMUCL and
CLISP. </p> </li>

</ul>


<h2>Emacs Lisp</h2>

<ul>

<li> <p> <a href="coffee.el">coffee.el</a> allows Emacs users to submit a
     <tt>BREW</tt> request to an <a href =
    "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2324.txt">RFC2324</a>-compliant coffee
    device (<strong>Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol</strong>, or
    HTCPCP). It prompts the user for the different additives, then issues a
    HTCPCP <tt>BREW</tt> request to the coffee device. You can probably
    guess how coffee.el came about ...yadda yadda everything but make
    coffee ...yadda yadda ... </p>

<p> coffee.el requires a special BREW-capable version of Emacs/W3 to be
    installed. 1999-09-29, under GNU GPL. Available as part of the Debian
    package <tt>emacs-goodies-el</tt>. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href="pg.el">pg.el</a> is a <strong>socket-level Emacs
     interface to the <a href = "http://www.PostgreSQL.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
     object-relational DBMS</strong>. It is capable of automatic coercion
     from a range of SQL types to the appropriate Emacs Lisp types.
     Supports large objects (BLOBs). Version 0.10 2003-02-12, under GNU
     GPL. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href="watson.el">watson.el</a> is an experimental <strong>Emacs
     interface to web search engines</strong> such as Altavista. Given a
     number of keywords to search for, it will send the query to several
     search engines. The results are then aggregated and displayed in a
     *watson* buffer. Currently backends exist for the search engines
     Altavista, Google, Yahoo!, Dejanews, Excite, Snap, ftpsearch and
     dmoz.org. watson is also able to generate a list of web pages which
     point to a given URL (function <tt>watson-referers</tt>). </p>

<p> watson.el attempts to rank hits intelligently: if an url is returned
    by more than one search engine, its rank will be increased. Hits in the
    same site are coalesced, with an increased rank. The ranking also takes
    into account the order in which hits were presented by the search
    engines. watson.el <strong>can be configured to issue multiple http
    requests in parallel</strong>, using an external program such as lynx
    for downloads. watson.el was inspired by the Sherlock web search
    program shipped with recent releases of MacOS. Requires Emacs/w3.
    Version 0.12 (2000-10-12) under GNU GPL. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href="dict-web.el">dict-web.el</a> is a simple Emacs interface
     to the Online Dictionary Database at <a href = "http://www.dict.org/">
     dict.org</a>. It will display the definitions for a word or phrase
     (defaulting to the word under the cursor). Requires Emacs/w3. Version
     0.11 (2001-04-25) under GNU GPL. </p>
     </li>

<li> <p> <a href="babel.el">babel.el</a> is an <strong>Emacs interface to
     different web translation services</strong> such as <a href =
     "http://babelfish.altavista.com/"> Babelfish</a>. Enter a phrase and a
     pair of languages to translate between, and it will connect to the
     server, translate the phrase (or buffer region) and display the
     result. babel.el has backends for <a href =
     "http://babelfish.altavista.com/" >Babelfish at Altavista</a> (doesn't
     currently work correctly since Babelfish uses UTF-8), <a href =
     "http://www.tranexp.com/InterTran.cgi" >InterTrans</a> (translate to
     and from any of 25 languages!), <a href =
     "http://www.systransoft.com/" >SysTran</a>, <a href =
     "http://www.freetranslation.com/" >FreeTranslation.com</a>, <a href =
     "http://www.worldblaze.com/">WorldBlaze</a>, <a href =
     "http://www.translate.ru/">e-PROMPT</a> and <a href =
     "http://dict.leo.org/">the Leo Dictionary</a>. babel.el requires <a
     href = "http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">w3</a>, the
     Emacs web browser, to be installed. v0.20 2001-09-11, under GNU GPL.

     [<strong>This package probably won't work</strong>, because
     the format of the HTML output by the translation servers has changed,
     and I haven't had time to update babel.el. Patches welcome!]
     </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href = "cgi.el">cgi.el</a> is a simple library for the
     Common Gateway Interface, which allows you to <strong>service requests
     for non static web pages in elisp</strong>. Provides routines for
     decoding arguments to GET- and POST-type CGI requests. Yes, this is
     another <i>because I can</i>; I don't expect performance to be crash
     hot. Version 0.2 2000-04-25, under GNU GPL. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href = "httpd.el">httpd.el</a> is an <strong>HTTP server
     embedded in the Emacs</strong>. It supports GET and HEAD requests for
     static and dynamic content. (supporting POST should be easy by
     stealing code from cgi.el above). Since Emacs doesn't support server
     sockets, you need to cheat a little and run it from a service such as
     tcpserver or inetd. You can get better performance by running a proxy
     server which forwards requests to a persistent emacs instance using
     gnuserv; see the commentary for details. Version 0.4, 2001-05-17 under
     GNU GPL. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href = "ipp.el">ipp.el</a> is an Emacs implementation of the
     <strong>Internet Printing Protocol</strong>. The IPP, defined by the
     <a href = "http://www.pwg.org/">Printer Working Group</a>, is intended
     to replace the old LPD protocol for interacting with network printers.
     This is only a partial implementation of the client side of the
     protocol, but it's sufficient to submit a print job to a device, to
     query its capabilities, and to examine its queue. Version 0.5
     2001-04-25, under GNU GPL. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href = "cmucl-wire.el">cmucl-wire.el</a> is a partial Emacs
     implementation of the client-side aspects of CMUCL's WIRE facility.
     WIRE is a simple sexp-based RPC mechanism that allows you to send
     requests to a remote CMUCL instance. cmucl-wire.el does not implement
     the remote-object parts of the wire protocol. Version 0.1 2003-08-07,
     under the GNU GPL. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href = "../lout/">lout-mode</a> is an <strong>Emacs major-mode
     for the document markup language Lout</strong> (which is in the same
     problem space as LaTeX). It provides font-lock support, interaction
     with the lout compiler and a Postscript previewer, completion support,
     imenu support, and a friendly menu. </p> </li>

<li> <p> <a href="squidftp">SquidFTP</a> is a <strong>Squid-enabled
     commandline ftp client</strong>. It is intended for use with ange-ftp
     (Emacs' transparent ftp support) in organizations which block direct
     FTP access, but allow it through a Squid caching proxy. Very hackish,
     version 0.1. </p> </li>
</ul>


<h2>Scheme</h2>

<ul>
<li> <p> A <a href="pgscsh-0.2.tar.gz">socket-level interface</a> to the <a
     href = "http://www.PostgreSQL.org/">PostgreSQL</a> object-relational
     DBMS for the <a href =
     "http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/scsh/">Scheme Shell</a>. Now (v
     0.2 released 1999-09-17) supports large objects (BLOBs). GNU LGPL.
     This is the same as the file in the <a href =
     "ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/scsh/contrib/">scsh contrib
     repository</a> at MIT. </p> </li>

<li> <p> Some <a href="ecm-net.tar.gz">networking code</a> for scsh. Includes an
     FTP client library, a POP3 client library (supporting APOP
     authentication) and access to the NetTime and Time protocols. GNU
     LGPL. </p> </li>

<li> <p> An example of the dump/restore <a href = "marshal.scm">marshalling
     functions</a> in scsh, for externalizing objects in a binary format.
     Unfortunately no faster than writing an ASCII stream. </p> </li>

<li> <p> An example of <a href = "gnuplot.scm">using gnuplot from scsh</a> via
     a pipe. </p> </li>

<li> <p> A scsh snippet providing a <a href = "daemonize.scm">daemonize
     function</a> which does <tt>chroot()</tt> to /, redirects stdin and
     stdout from <tt>/dev/null</tt>, and forks into a new session. </p> </li>

</ul>


<h2>Fractal generation</h2>

<ul>
<li> <p> The <a href="mandel.ps">Mandelbrot Set</a>, in Postscript. Yes,
     Postscript is a programming language, not just a page layout language.
     You can select a black and white display, or full color. Feel free to
     send me a copy if you have access to a 1200 dpi color Postscript
     printer :-) There's also a simpler fractal called the <a
     href="gingerbread.ps">Gingerbread Man</a>. More fractals in Postscript
     <a href =
     "http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~andersr/fractal/PostScript.html">here</a>.
     </p> </li>
</ul>


<h2>Misc</h2>

<ul>
<li> <p> A small <a href="address.pl">utility</a> for printing address labels
     onto stickers. This perl script takes a list of newline-separated
     addresses from stdin and outputs a PostScript file to stdout. The size
     of the sheet of stickers is adjustable (A4, letter format, etc), as is
     the number of labels horizontally and vertically per sheet, and the
     desired font. The script is intelligent enough to compress items which
     wouldn't normally fit onto a label (three cheers for scalable
     PostScript fonts). </p> </li>
     
</ul>
