Entei-edraccordin?:to-Act  of  the  Parliament  of  Canada,  in  the  year  one  thousand

PKEFACE. 


This  Index  to  the  Laws  of  the  Province  of  Quebec  contains,  not  only 
every  Chapter,  Public  and  Private,  whether  repealed  or  still  in  force ; 
but  every  subject  upon  which  the  L'^gislature  has  passed,  continuing  the 
same  in  an  unbroken  succession  of  references  from  the  earliest  enact- 
ment to  the  present  day. 

In  addition  to  the  annual  Statutes,  it  covers  the  Revised  Statutes  of 
the  Province  published  in  1888,  and  the  supplement  thereto,  also  such 
Orders  in  Council  and  Imperial  Acts  as  have  been  published  in  connec- 
tion with  the  above  named. 

The  Index,  so  far  as  it  relates  to  j^eneral  subjects,  is  arranged  strictly 
in  alpliabetical  order,  while  under  the  several  headings  each  subject  is 
followed  chronologically,  giving  in  every  ease  the  volume  (or  year),  the 
chapter,  and  (when  necessary)  the  section,  subsection  or  page. 

In  reference  to  the  Civil  Code,  and  the  Municipal  Code,  it  will  be 
observed  that  the  chronological  arrangement  is  followed  by  a  numerical 
arrangement  in  each  case. 

This  is  the  tirst  attempt  that  has  been  made  to  cover  this  extensive 
held  of  legislation,  and  I  trust  the  work  will  give  satisfaction  and  prove 
to  be  of  utility  and  convenience  to  Legislators,  members  of  the  Legal 
Profession  and  to  the  Public  generally.
