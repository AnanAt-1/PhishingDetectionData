THE    STEWARTS    OF    APPIN. 

THE  origin  and  early  genealogy  of  the  House  of  Stewart  have  en- 
gaged the  attention  and  labours  of  numerous  archaeologists. 
The  position  occupied  by  the  family  in  Scotland,  and  their  relations 
with  the  throne,  have  connected  them  closely  with  the  recorded  history, 
as  well  as  with  the  traditions  of  the  country.  The  genealogists  of  the 
last  century  had  no  difficulty  in  tracing  with  accuracy,  and  with  the 
support  of  deeds  and  charters  of  the  kings  of  Scotland,  their  descent 
from  Alan,  father  of  Walter  the  first  High  Steward  of  Scotland  under 
King  David  I.,  who  reigned  1 124  to  1 153.  But  the  researches  of  later 
antiquaries  have  not  only  brought  to  light  proofs  of  their  having  been 
seated  in  Norfolk  in  1 100,  and  in  Shropshire  a  few  years  later,  but  have 
also  demonstrated  the  probability  of  the  correctness  of  the  traditional 
and  generally  received  accounts  of  their  Celtic  descent. 

Where  records  exist  the  task  is  easy,  but  it  becomes  more  difficult 
when  we  reach  the  period  where  charters  end,  and  tradition  begins. 
But  to  reject,  as  absolutely  unworthy  of  credit,  all  history  or  tradition 
which  cannot  be  established  by  conclusive  or  documentary  proof,  would 
be  to  efface  almost  entirely  the  early  annals  of  our  country,  for  such 
proof  it  is  impossible,  in  most  instances,  to  obtain  ;  and  we  should  thus 
leave  unaccounted  for  the  many  monuments  of  the  piety  and  patriotism 
of  our  ancestors,  and  should  consequently  rob  them  of  the  credit  which 
is  justly  due  to  their  valour  and  to  their  zeal  for  religion.  Thus  for  in- 
stance, Christian  temples  were  built  and  the  Danes  were  expelled  from

Scotland.  Are  lona  and  Loncarty  to  be  regarded  but  as  names,  not  as 
realities  ?  Should  we  not,  instead  of  disregarding  the  traditions  and 
memorials  of  the  past,  do  all  in  our  power  to  preserve  them,  until 
further  researches  shall  enable  the  enquirer  to  discover  the  exact  truth  ? 
In  this  view,  the  reader  shall  be  presented  with  such  information  and 
particulars  regarding  the  early  history  of  the  House  of  Stewart  as  can  be 
collected  from  the  most  approved  authorities,  and  it  will  be  for  himself 
to  determine  the  value  to  be  placed  on  their  testimony. 

Among  the  various  authorities  from  which  this  account  has  been 
compiled,  are  Fordun's  History,  WInton's  Chronicles,  Barbour's  Bruce, 
Blind  Harry's  Wallace,  Holinshed's  Chronicles,  Buchanan's  History  of

The  descent  of  the  ancestors  of  the  Stewarts  from  King  Fergus 
L,   whose  reign  began  B.C.    330,  and  who   was  the  contemporary   of 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Alexander  the  Great,  and  Darius  the  Mede,  King  of  Persia,  is  traced 
by  various  historians  and  genealogists  through  thirty-five  generations 
of  kings,  down  to 

Ethus,  who  succeeded  his  brother,  Constantine  II.,  a.d.  875.  At 
this  point  the  descent  of  the  progenitors  of  the  Stewarts  diverges  from 
that  of  the  Crown,  into  the  Hne  of  Doir,  second  son  of  Ethus.  But  on 
the  death  of  King  David  II.  in  1371,  the  representation  of  the  main 
hne  devolved  upon  his  nephew,  Robert  II.,  the  descendant  and  repre- 
sentative of  Doir. 

Doir,  second  son  of  Ethus,  was  Maormor  of  Lochaber,  and  married 
Osfleda,  daughter  of  Osbert,  King  of  Northumberland.     Died  936. 

Murdoch,  son  of  Doir,  married  Helen,  or  Dervegil,  daughter  of 
Hugh,  said  to  be  the  ancestor  of  the  Douglasses.      He  died  959. 

Farquhard,  son  of  Doir,  Maormor  of  Lochaber,  married  Idua, 
daughter  of  Eric  of  Norway,  and  was  killed  at  Loncarty  in  980. 

Kenneth,  son  of  Farquhard,  Maormor  of  Lochaber,  married 
Dunclina,  daughter  of  King  Kenneth  III.     Died  1030. 

Bancho,  son  of  Kenneth,  Maormor  of  Lochaber,  General  of  the 
army  with  Macbeth,  Governor  of  the  Western  Isles  under  King 
Duncan  I.  Simson  and  other  Historians  say  he  was  a  Chief  Officer  of 
the  Crown,  and  employed  as  Steward  in  gathering  in  the  Royal 
revenues.  He  defeated  Sueno,  King  of  Norway,  who  had  landed  an 
army  at  Kinghorn  in  Fife,  and  also  the  forces  of  Canute,  King  of 
Denmark,  near  Teith.  He  married  Maud,  grand  daughter  of  Garede, 
Thane  or  Maormor  of  Atholl,  and  was  murdered,  with  his  three  eldest 
sons,  by  Macbeth  about  1050. 

Fleance,  son  of  Bancho.  Of  him  we  read  in  Buchanan's  History, 
that  on  the  murder  of  his  father  and  brothers,  he  escaped  "  secretly  to 
Wales;"  and  in  Corbet  Anderson's  Early  History  and  Antiquities  of 
Shropshire,  that  when  Macbeth,  King  of  Scotland,  "  sought  about  the 
year  1050,  to  secure  the  succession  in  his  own  line,  by  putting  to  death, 
and  confiscating  the  estates  of  those  whom  he  suspected  of  plotting  the 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


restoration  of  Malcolm  Canmore,  amongst  those  who  fled  from  his 
reach  was  Fleance,  son  of  Banquo,  the  murdered  Thane  of  Lochaber. 
He  fled  to  the  Prince  of  North  Wales,  Gryffyth  ap  Lewellyn,  with 
whose  daughter  Guenta  being  enamoured,  the  Welsh  Princess  bore  to 
Fleance  a  son  Alan."  Gryffyth  ap  Lewellyn  was  originally  the  Prince 
of  Powys,  of  which  principality  Shropshire  formed  part.  He  conquered 
North  Wales,  and  married  Alditha  (whose  second  husband  was  Harold, 
slain  at  Hastings),  daughter  of  Algus  the  Saxon  Earl  of  Mercia,  by 
whom  he  had  the  above  mentioned  daughter  Guenta.  Of  the  same 
family  was  Meredith  ap  Bleddyn,  whose  estates  in  Shropshire  Alan, 
filius  Flaaldi  or  Fleanchi,  afterwards  received ;  and  a  lineal  descendant 
of  the  family,  twelve  generations  later,  was  the  renowned  Owen  Glen- 
dower,  in  assisting  whom.  Sir  Robert  Stewart  of  Durrisdeer,  elder  son 
of  Sir  Robert  Stewart  of  Schanbothy,  was  killed  at  the  battle  of 
Shrewsbury  in  1403. 

Ralph  Holinshed,  in  his  Chronicles,  written  a.d.  1577,  says,  that  on 
account  of  their  consanguinity  with  the  murdered  Duncan,  "  Macbeth 
devised  to  slea  Banquo  and  his  soune.  It  chanced  through  the  benefit 
of  the  dark  night  that  though  the  father  was  slain,  the  son  yet,  by  the 
help  of  Almighty  God  reserving  him  to  better  fortune,  escaped  that 
danger,  and  to  avoid  further  peril  fled  into  Wales." 

All  genealogists  concur  in  saying  that  Jean,  daughter  and  heiress 
of  Angus  Macrory,  or  M'Roderick,  Lord  of  Bute,  who  was  married  to 
Alexander,  fourth  High  Steward,  was  of  her  husband's  blood  and 
family.  The  relationship  is  acknowledged  even  by  those  genealogists, 
who  reject  the  descent  from  Fleance,  as  not  being  proved  by  direct 
documentary  evidence.  It  is  almost  certain  she  was  not  a  descendant 
of  her  husband's  family  after  their  return  to  Scotland,  but  Duncan 
Stewart,  M.A.  (1739),  says  Kenneth,  father  of  Banquo,  had  a  daughter, 
Gunora,  married  to  Malcolm  Macrorie  of  Bute,  and  it  does  not  appear 
how  Jean,  heiress  of  Bute,  and  her  husband  could  be  connected  in  any 
other  way. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Of  Flaaldus  or  Fleanchus  we  know  little,  except  by  tradition. 
His  name  appears  to  have  been  variously  spelled ;  he  is  called  Fladald 
in  various  charters  to  his  son.  Dugdale  gives  his  name  as  Flathald. 
Leland  calls  his  son  Alan  Fleilsone,  and  in  the  Fitzwarine  Chronicle  he 
is  named  Alan  Fitz  Flaen.  In  1275  the  Norfolk  jurors  spoke  of  the 
father  of  Alan  as  "  a  certain  knight  called  Flancus."  There  are  many 
circumstances  in  the  history  of  Alan,  and  his  son  Walter,  which  point 
to  their  connection  with  Wales.  Alan  was  undoubtedly  a  man  of  high 
position,  but  neither  in  the  Domesday  Book,  the  Roll  of  Battle  Abbey, 
nor  in  any  notice  of  those  who  accompanied  William  the  Conqueror 
from  Normandy,  is  his  name  or  his  father's  included. 

Camden  says  Fleance  was  murdered  on  account  of  the  favour 
with  which  he,  a  stranger,  was  looked  upon  by  the  Prince,  about  the 
year  1060,  leaving  one  son,  Alan. 

Alan,  born  about  a.d.  1050.  In  consequence  of  a  quarrel  at  the 
Welsh  Court,  about  1067,  Alan  returned  to  his  father's  native  country 
of  Scotland,  at  a  time  when  Edgar  Atheling,  with  his  mother  and  two 
sisters,  had  left  England,  and  had  placed  themselves  under  the  protec- 
tion of  Malcolm  III.,  who  soon  after  married  Margaret,  the  elder  of 
the  two  princesses.  Alan  rapidly  distinguished  himself  in  the  service 
of  Malcolm,  and  he  also  served  in  the  Crusade  of  1096-9.  Robert 
Stewarde,  last  Prior  and  first  Dean  of  Ely,  says  "  he  performed  great 
things  in  the  Holy  Land  under  the  standard  of  Godfrey  of  Bouillon." 
In  1 100  he  seems  to  have  gone  to  England  in  the  suite  of  the  Princess 
Matilda,  who,  on  the  i  ith  November  in  that  year,  became  the  wife  of 
Henry  I.  Having  been  formerly  distinguished  as  a  servant  of  King 
Malcolm,  and  more  recently  as  a  Crusader,  Alan  seems  to  have  been 
retained  in  the  service  of  Henry  I.  on  account  of  capabilities  which,  at 
that  period  of  his  reign,  were  so  much  needed  by  the  King.  The 
learned  Eyton,  whom  we  have  quoted  above,  and  who  has  examined 
with  the  utmost  attention  and  critical  research  the  legends  and  records 
relating  to  the  "  Origin  and  early  History  of  the  Houses  of  Fitzalan 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


and  Stuart,"  as  well  as  the  "  Antiquities  and  Archaeological  History  of 
Shropshire,"  relates  how  Henry  I.,  as  a  means  of  strengthening  his 
hold  on  the  English  sceptre,  to  which  his  title  was  doubtful,  selected  as 
his  principal  counsellors  a  small  but  able  band  of  chieftains,  preferring 
foreigners  to  Normans  ;  "  such,"  he  says,  "  in  Shropshire  were  Warin  de 
Metz,  a  Lorrainer,  the  three  Peverels,  and  greatest  of  all,  Alan,  son  of 
Flaald." 

It  has  been  indeed  contended,  though  we  do  not  admit  the  conten- 
tion, that  the  father  of  Alan  was  of  Breton  origin.  Main,  son  of 
Theon,  granted  (1040-66)  to  the  Cell  or  Priory  of  Combourg,  dependent 
on  the  Abbey  of  Marmoutier,  his  rights  in  the  church  of  Guguen,  on 
the  restoration  to  health  of  his  sons  Hamon  and  Walter.  It  has  been 
conjectured  that  Walter  was  the  father  of 

I.  Fledald,  who  had  issue — 

1 .  Alan,  Seneschal  of  the  Church  of  Dol ;  transferred,  between 

1076  and  1081,  his  rights  within  the  vill  of  Mezuoit,  to 
the  new  church  of  St  Florent  at  Dol ;  gave,  before  1084, 
by  the  name  of  Alan  Fitz-Floaud,  all  his  rights  in  the 
church  of  Guguen  to  the  monks  of  Marmoutier  ;  went  to 
the  Crusades  1096  (Ordericus  Vitalis).  D.  s.p.  The 
town  of  Dol  was  formerly  of  considerable  strength,  and 
it  has  been  thought  that  it  may  have  been  the  siege  of 
this  place,  in  1076,  which  introduced  the  brothers  to  the 
notice  of  William  the  Conqueror. 

2.  Fledald,  who  succeeded  his  brother  Alan. 

3.  Riwallon,  a  monk  of  St  Florent  at  Saumur. 

II.  Fledald,  consents,  1076-81,  to  his  brother  Alan's  grant  to  St 
Florent  at  Dol ;  probably  dead  before  i  loi,  as  there  is  evidence  in  one 
of  Henry  I.'s  charters  of  3d  September  in  that  year,  that  his  son  Alan

whose  "seeing  and  hearing"  Henry  I.  confirmed  at  York,  to  the 
monks  of  Marmoutier,  the  donation  of  Ralph  Paynel.  By  his  wife 
Avelina,  he  left  issue — 

1.  Jordan,  mentioned  in  the  Pipe  Roll  of  1130;  died  before 

1 147,  leaving  issue — 

Alan.  Alan  Fitz  Jordan  Fitz  Alan  inherited  the 
Britanny  estates;  confirmed,  1154-61,  his  grand- 
father's grant  to  Marmoutier ;  founded  the  Abbey 
of  St  Mary  of  Tronchet,  near  Dol,  before  1147. 
(Gallia  Christiania,  vol.  xiv.) 

2.  William,  called  "  Juvenis"  by  Ordericus  in  1138  ;  inherited 

the  English  estates  ;  ancestor  of  the  Fitz-Alans. 
I  3.  Walter,  Steward  of  Scotland  ;  ancestor  of  the  Stewarts. 

The  chartulary  of  St  Florent,  near  Saumur,  containing  these 
grants,  has  not  yet  been  published,  but  Lobineau's  transcription  of  them 
has  been  taken  as  correct. 

The  similarity  of  the  family  names  is,  no  doubt,  extremely  strik- 
ing, but  it  cannot  be  held  to  be  conclusive  evidence  until  the  connection 
of  this  Breton  family  with  England  is  proved.  Conclusions  from  such 
premisses,  when  unsupported  by  connecting  evidence,  would  be,  in  the 
great  majority  of  cases,  erroneous.  For  instance,  we  find  from  the 
chartulary  of  St  Peter  of  Chartres,  that  a  Walter  Fitz-Fleald  or  Fledald 
held  a  considerable  fief  near  Boisville,  under  Walter  de  Alneto,  which 
he  had  acquired  with  his  wife  Fredesindis,  and  that  he  was  a  great 
benefactor  to  the  abbey.  Here  also,  the  similarity  of  family  names  is 
remarkable,  but  any  broad  deductions  drawn  from  such  an  occurrence 
are  unwarrantable.  Indeed,  some  positive  and  not  merely  inferential 
proof  seems  necessary  before  we  can  reject  a  tradition  so  long  and  so 
firmly  rooted  as  that  of  the  Celtic  descent  of  Fleance.  But  these  two 
theories,  apparently  so  widely  divergent,  might,  perhaps,  be  reconciled 
by  the  supposition — if  we  felt  disposed  to  adopt  this  method  of  supple- 
menting  our   genealogical    information — that    Fleance    fled    from    the 


Welsh  Court  to  the  kindred  country  of  Britanny,  whither  the  know- 
ledge of  the  language  acquired  in  Wales  might  be  one  of  the  reasons 
for  his  flight,  and  where  he  subsequently  married ;  his  Scottish  name, 
Fleance,  being  changed  into  a  name  more  in  harmony  with  the  nomen- 
clature of  his  adopted  country.  Indeed  Duncan  Stewart  records  at 
considerable  length  the  tradition  then  universally  believed  of  the  flight 
to  Britanny,  and  the  subsequent  marriage  there  ;  but  in  his  account  these 
incidents  belong  to  the  history  of  Fleance's  son,  not  to  that  of  Fleance 
himself,  a  mistake  the  explanation  of  which  will  be  found  at  p.  i6. 

The  first  recorded  mention  of  Alan  in  England  belongs  to  iioi. 
On  September  3d  of  that  year  the  King  held  a  great  Court  at  Windsor, 
and  a  charter  then  granted  to  Herbert,  Bishop  of  Norwich,  is  signed 
by  witnesses,  "  illustrious  of  England,  ecclesiastical  and  secular,"  the  list 
being  headed  by  the  name  of  Queen  Matilda,  and  followed,  among 
others,  by  that  of  Alan,  which  occupies  a  high  position  on  the  roll, 
standing  before  those  of  Gilbert  and  Roger  Fitz-Richard,  Robert 
Malet,  and  Herbert,  the  King's  chamberlain  (Monasticon,  iv.  17,  v.) 

Another  charter,  by  which  Herbert,  Bishop  of  Norwich,  founded 
the  Cathedral  Priory  of  his  see,  passed  on  the  same  occasion,  and  was 
attested  by  nearly  the  same  witnesses  as  the  first,  including  the  King 
and  Queen  and  Alan  Fitz-Flaald.  This  charter  confirms  the  "  Church 
of  Langham,  which  had  been  Alan's,  and  his  (Alan's)  tithes."  Now 
Langham  was  afterwards  a  recognized  portion  of  Fitz-Alan's  Honour 
of  Mileham,  from  which  it  was  not  far  distant.  We  see  from  the 
Hundred  Rolls  (i.  434)  that  the  tenure  of  this  fief  was  made  a  subject 
of  report  by  a  provincial  jury  in  1275.  The  jurors  of  the  hundred  of 
Launditch,  in  Norfolk,  said  that  "  Melam  (Mileham),  with  its  appur- 
tenances, was  in  the  hands  of  William  the  Bastard  at  the  Conquest, 
and  the  said  king  gave  the  said  manor  to  a  certain  knight,  who  was 
called  Flancus,"  etc.  But  these  gentlemen,  in  their  wish  to  record  the 
Norfolk  tradition,  and  to  designate  the  father  of  Fitz-Flaad,  proceed  to 
adulterate  this  probable  approach  to  etymological   correctness  with  a 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


great  historical  inaccuracy,  for  they  add,  "who  came  with  the  said 
King  into  England,"  etc.  Of  such  a  Norman  knight,  however,  there 
is  nowhere,  as  has  been  before  observed,  any  trace  whatever  to  be 
found.  Summarily,  then,  we  conclude  that  Alan  Fitz-Flaald  had 
acquired  a  part  of  his  Norfolk  fief  before  September  iioi,  and  had 
already  granted  a  church  and  tithes  therein  towards  the  endowment  of 
Norwich  Priory.  Henry  I.  also  gave  Alan  the  manor  of  Eaton,  which 
he  transferred  to  Norwich  Priory,  apparently  before  November  1 109, 
as  that  was  the  date  on  which  the  king  promised  a  confirmatory  charter 
"  when  Alan  shall  come  to  my  court." 

Alan  made  a  further  grant  of  land,  his  wife  Adelina  being  a  party 
to  the  charter,  to  the  Priory  of  Castle  Acre,  a  Cluniac  house  on  the 
western  boundary  of  his  honour  of  Mileham.  He  was  also  a  benefactor 
(as  were  his  son  and  grandson)  to  the  Cell  of  St  Peter,  at  Sele  in  Sussex. 

Passing  now  to  the  connection  of  Alan  with  Shropshire,  we  find 
that  Warin,  the  first  Sheriff  of  Shropshire,  was  dead  at  the  time  of 
Domesday,  1085-6,  leaving,  by  his  marriage  with  Ameria,  the  niece  of 
Earl  Roger  de  Montgomery,  an  infant  son  Hugh.  Ameria  was  re- 
married to  Rainald  de  Ballol,  and  Rainald,  either  in  right  of  his  wife, 
or  as  guardian  of  Warin's  heir,  held  the  Shrievalty  and  the  lands  of 
Warin,  both  of  which  he  ceded  to  Hugh  on  the  latter's  attaining  a 
sufficient  age.  Hugh,  however,  died  without  issue,  and  the  Shrievalty 
and  attached  barony  reverted  to  the  Crown,  and  we  read  (Monasticon, 
III.  519,  col.  a),  "  Alanus  filius  Fladaldi  honorem  Vicecomitis  Warini 
post  filium  ejus  suscepit."  From  these  words  has  arisen  the  unwarranted 
assumption  that  Alan  acquired  his  Shropshire  fief  by  marrying  a  sup- 
posed daughter  and  eventual  heir  of  Warin,  but  there  is  no  confirmation 
whatever  of  such  a  marriage. 

It  appears,  therefore,  that  Alan  received  by  a  new  investiture,  and 
by  grant  of  Henry  I.,  the  whole  "  Honour  of  the  Sheriff  of  Shropshire," 
which  lay  chiefly  in  Shropshire,  but  which  included  also  the  lands  of 
Wolston  and  Stretton  super  Dunesmore  in  Warwickshire,  certain  manors 


in  Staffordshire,  and  Arundel  in  Sussex.  In  1109,  on  the  occasion  of 
the  visit  of  Henry  I.  to  Shropshire,  Alan's  name  appears  as  attesting  a 
judicial  decision  of  Richard  de  Belmeis,  Bishop  of  London,  regarding 
some  right  of  Shrewsbury  Abbey,  and  to  the  same  Abbey  and  at  the 
same  time,  Alan  Fitz-Fladald,  with  ready  devotion,  conceded  all  things 
which  had  been  bestowed  by  his  predecessors  or  by  his  barons,  whether 
in  his  time  or  previously. 

In  summing  up  the  evidence  which  he  had  so  laboriously  collected, 
of  which  the  preceding  is  only  an  abstract,  Eyton  remarks  that  the 
change  from  Fleanchus  to  Flaaldus  is  not  very  great,  when  we  compare 
it  with  other  instances,  when  a  foreign  name  had  to  be  accommodated 
to  the  English  ear.  It  might  have  been  added  that  Fleance's  change 
of  country  may  also  have  involved  a  partial  change  of  name.  The 
opinions  of  Eyton  are  also  shared  by  Corbet  Anderson,  who  says, 
"  Meanwhile,  Hugh,  son  of  Warine,  having  deceased  without  issue, 
Alan  Fitz  Flaald  received,  by  grant,  from  Henry  I.,  a.d.  1102,  the 
honour  of  the  Sheriff  of  Shropshire.  It  is  a  question  who  the  new  lord 
of  Upton  Magna  was,  but  that  Alan  Fitz  Flaald  was  progenitor  of  the 
Royal  House  of  Stewart  is  beyond  a  doubt."  The  passage  previously 
quoted  as  to  the  identity  of  Fleanchus  with  Flaaldus  follows,  and 
Anderson  thus  continues,  "  The  change  from  Fleanchus  to  Flaaldus  is 
certainly  not  very  great,  especially  when  we  bear  in  mind  that  the  nomen- 
clature of  that  period  was  far  from  fixed.  According  to  this,  then,  Alan 
Fitz  Flaald  was  grandson  of  Gryffyth  ap  Lewellyn,  Prince  of  North 
Wales.  Now,  as  Gryffyth  married  Alditha,  daughter  of  Algus,  King 
of  Mercia,  by  whom  he  had  Guenta,  it  follows  that  Alan  Fitz  Flaald, 
legitimate  or  illegitimate,  was  the  great-grandson  of  the  Saxon  Earl  of 
Mercia.  Henry  I.,  be  it  remembered,  married  a  Scoto-Saxon  princess  ; 
therefore,  in  giving  Alan  Fitz  Flaald  the  specific  fief  of  the  Sheriff  of 
Shropshire,  he  may  be  supposed  to  have  been  actuated  by  a  variety  of 
motives.  In  the  first  place,  he  (Henry  I.)  was  planting  in  the  very  van 
of  border  warfare,  a  chieftain  who  sprang  from  the  native  princes  of 


North  Wales.  Secondly,  descending,  as  Alan  did,  from  the  Saxon  Earl 
of  Mercia,  Henry  I.  acted  in  accordance  with  his  well-known  policy  of 
conciliating  the  English.  Again  he,  who  now  became  lord  of  Upton 
Magna,  represented  a  house  illustrious  in  that  land  of  Scots,  where 
Henry  I.  had  married  his  queen." 

It  is  certainly  noteworthy  that  "  Flathail,"  which,  in  its  spelling,  is 
almost  identical  with  the  Flathald  of  Dugdale,  and  in  its  pronunciation 
(Fla-al)  so  closely  resembles  Flaald,  signifies  in  the  Gaelic  language 
"princely."  Without  attaching  undue  weight  to  phonetic  etymologies, 
it  is  impossible  to  avoid  remarking  how  appropriately  this  epithet  would 
describe,  in  an  age  where  names  were  so  commonly  derived  from  per- 
sonal characteristics,  the  youthful  stranger,  whose  appearance  and 
demeanour  procured  for  him,  as  Holinshed  so  quaintly  narrates,  such 
signal  favour  in  the  eyes  of  the  Welsh  princess.  In  the  Welsh  the 
cognate  word  is  "gwlad,"  pronounced  flad,  which  also  bears  what  seems 
to  be  a  very  significant  resemblance  to  Flaald,  the  Flaaldus  of  the 
charters  quoted. 

Chalmers,  in  his  "Caledonia,"  says,  "Alan  was  undoubtedly  a  person 
of  great  consequence  at  the  accession  of  Henry  I.  He  was  a  frequent 
witness  to  the  king's  charters,  along  with  other  eminent  personages  of  that 
splendid  Court."  Besides  witnessing  the  above-mentioned  charters  of  3d 
September  iioi,  "he  was  a  witness  to  a  charter  of  Henry  I.,  together 
with  Matilda,  his  queen,  the  daughter  of  Malcolm  Canmore,  and  other 
personages  of  the  highest  rank,  dated  the  iSth  September  iioi,  which 
charter  was  engraved  in  1728,  from  the  original  in  the  possession  of 
Matthew  Howard,  the  Lord  of  the  Manor  of  Thorp,  near  Norwich. 
He  also  witnessed  another  charter  of  Henry  I.  at  Canterbury,  and  one 
of  Willian  Peverel  to  the  Church  of  St  Peter  at  Shrewsbury.  Alan 
subscribed  all  these  charters,  '  Ego,  Alanus  Flaaldi  filius.'  " 

He  married  between  11 00  and  1105  Adelina,  called  also  Avelina 
and  Adeliza,  daughter  of  Ernulph  de  Hesding,  half-sister,  and  in  her 
issue  co-heir  of  Ernulph  de  Hesding  the  second,  who,  for  his  brave  de-

fence  of  Shrewsbury  in  1 138,  was  so  mercilessly  put  to  death  by  Stephen. 
The  various  fees  in  Gloucestershire,  Wiltshire,  and  elsewhere,  which 
formed  the  Domesday  Barony  of  Ernulph  de  Hesding,  were  found  in 
1 165  to  be  divided  among  coparceners,  a  third  being  vested  in  the 
representatives  of  Alan  Fitz  Flaald. 
They  had  four  sons  : — 

I.  William.  In  1 126,  at  the  time  when  William  was  entering 
upon  manhood,  the  Earldom  of  Shrewsbury  had  continued 
in  the  crown  for  twenty-four  years  ;  and  Henry  I.,  having 
then  convened  an  assembly  of  his  prelates  and  barons  at 
London  during  the  feast  of  Christmas,  gave  the  county  of 
Salopesbury,  says  William  of  Malmesbury  (Hist.  Novell, 
lib.  I.,  sub.  init.),  to  his  second  wife,  Adelais,  daughter  of 
the  Duke  of  Louvain.  The  Queen  appointed  for  her 
viscount  or  sheriff,  William  Fitzalan,  "  a  baron  not  inferior 
to  earls,"  in  the  estimate  of  a  contemporary  writer  (Gesta 
Regis  Stephani,  356).  William  married  first  Christiana, 
niece  of  Robert,  the  consul.  Earl  of  Gloucester.  She 
died  in  1153,  leaving  one  son,  Alan,  who  died  in  infancy, 
and  was  buried  at  Haughmond.  William  married, 
secondly,  Isabel,  daughter  and  sole  heiress  of  Helias  de 
Say,  Lord  of  Clun.  Their  son,  William  Fitz- Alan  (II), 
born  about  1 154,  married  the  daughter  of  Hugh  de  Lacy 
of  Ewyas,  and  died  June  121 1,  having  had  issue,  William 
(who  died  12 16,  s.p.),  and  John  Fitz-Alan.  John,  who 
died  about  June  1240,  married  first,  Isabel  de  Albini,  in 
her  issue  co-heir  of  the  Earls  of  Arundel.  Their  great- 
grandson,  Richard  Fitz-Alan,  born  3d  February  1267, 
succeeded  to  the  Earldom  of  Arundel,  and  changed  his 
residence  from  Shropshire  to  Sussex.  The  escheat  rolls 
of  Henry  V.  show  that  Thomas,  Earl  of  Arundel,  who 
died  without  issue,  possessed,  among  other  great  estates. 


Oswestrie,  the  original  seat  of  Alan,  and  Clune  Castle, 
the  demesne  of  William,  the  son  of  Alan.  The  Earl- 
dom of  Arundel,  with  the  baronies  of  Fitz-Alan,  Clun, 
Oswaldestrie,  and  Maltravers,  became  merged  in  1556  in 
the  Dukedom  of  Norfolk  by  the  marriage  of  Mary, 
daughter  and  eventual  heir  of  Henry  Fitz-Alan,  Earl  of 
Arundel,  with  Thomas,  fourth  Duke  of  Norfolk,  who 
was  beheaded  in  1572  for  his  adherence  to  the  cause  of 
Mary,  Queen  of  Scots.  The  earldom  (a  feudal  honour, 
as  adjudged  in  Parliament,  8th  July  1433,  eleventh  Henry 
VI.),  is  held  by  possession  of  Arundel  Castle  only,  with- 
out any  creation,  and  also  by  summons  to  Parliament, 
1 6th  June  1580. 

Walter,  afterwards  High  Steward  of  Scotland. 

Jordan,  occurs  11 29  and  11 30,  as  in  possession  of  lands 
granted  to  him  in  Lincolnshire.  He  must  have  died 
before  1 147,  and  his  line  appears  to  have  become  extinct 
in  the  person  of  his  son,  Alan  Fitz-Jordan  Fitz-Alan, 
who  was  a  benefactor  of  the  Cell  of  St  Peter  at  Sele,  in 
Sussex,  belonging  to  the  Abbey  of  St  Florand,  in  Anjou. 

Simon,  who  accompanied  Walter  to  Scotland,  and  witnessed 
his  charter  to  the  Abbey  of  Paisley  about  1 1 60,  signing 
as  "  Frater  Walteri,  filii  Alani,  dapiferi."  Simon  had  a 
son,  Robert,  who  is  designed  in  the  chartulary  of  Paisley 
nephew  of  Walter,  the  High  Steward,  and  from  him  the 
Earls  of  Kilmarnock  were  descended.  To  this  Robert, 
the  name  of  Boyt  or  Boyd  was  given,  derived  from  the 
Gaelic  word  "  Boidh,"  signifying  fair  or  yellow.  William, 
fourth  and  last  Earl  of  Kilmarnock,  joined  Prince 
Charles  in  1745,  and  was  executed  on  Tower  Hill  on 
the  1 8th  August  1746,  when  the  earldom  ceased,  but  his 
son,    James,    succeeded    his    grand-aunt,    the    Countess

Mary,  in  the  Earldom  of  Errol.     The  armorial  shield  of 
the  Kilmarnock  family  bore  the  fess  chequd. 

Also,  a  daughter,  Sibil,  married  in  or  before  1132  to  Roger  de 
Freville.  Alan  died  about  11 14,  and  was  succeeded  in  his  Shropshire 
fief  by  his  eldest  son,  William. 

Walter,  the  second  son  of  Alan  Fitz-Flaald,  together  with  the  rest 
of  his  family,  took  an  active  part  on  behalf  of  the  Empress  Maude,  the 
niece  of  King  David  I.  of  Scotland,  in  her  conflict  with  Stephen  for  the 
English  crown.  Hume  notices  William  Fitz-Alan  as  a  powerful  par- 
tisan on  the  side  of  Maude.  Chalmers,  in  his  "  Caledonia,"  writes  as  fol- 
lows : — "Walter,  the  son  of  Alan,  undoubtedly  obtained  from  David  I., 
and  from  his  successor,  Malcolm  IV.,  great  possessions,  a  high  office, 
and  extensive  patronage.  And  it  may  be  reasonably  asked  by  what 
influence  he  could  acquire  from  two  kings  so  much  opulence  and  such  an 
office  ?  David  I.  was  a  strenuous  supporter  of  the  claims  of  his  niece, 
the  Empress  Maude,  in  her  severe  contest  with  Stephen.  William, 
the  brother  of  Walter,  influenced  by  the  Earl  of  Gloucester,  the  natural 
son  of  Henry  I.,  and  the  powerful  partisan  of  his  sister,  the  Empress, 
seized  Shrewsbury  in  September  1139,  and  held  it  for  her  interest. 
Walter  attended  her,  with  King  David,  at  the  siege  of  Winchester  in 
1 141,  where  they  were  overpowered  by  the  London  citizens,  and 
obliged  to  flee.  Such,  then,  were  the  bonds  of  connection  between 
David  I.  and  the  sons  of  Alan,  who  were  also  favoured  by  the  Earl  of 
Gloucester.  It  was,  probably,  on  that  occasion  that  Walter  accom- 
panied David  into  Scotland.  William,  the  son  of  Alan,  adhered 
steadily  to  the  Empress,  and  was  rewarded  by  Henry  II.  for  his  attach- 
ment. Thus  Walter,  the  son  of  Alan,  could  not  have  had  more  power- 
ful protectors  than  the  Earl  of  Gloucester  with  David  I.,  and  Henry  II. 
with  Malcolm  IV."  Chalmers  might  also  have  included,  among  other 
reasons  for  David's  favour  for  Walter,  that  it  was  well  known  to  both 
that  they  were  already  allied  in  blood.  William,  the  elder  brother,  as 
heir  to  his  father,  was  amply  provided  for  ;  but  Weaker,  though  not

without  lands,  would  only  have  a  younger  son's  portion.  Mr  W. 
Fraser  says  that,  before  going  to  Scotland,  Walter  had  lands  in 
appanage,  being  the  provision  made  for  him  as  younger  son,  at  Os- 
westrie,  of  the  Fitz-Alan  fief  or  barony,  adjoining  the  lands  of  the 
Priory  of  Wenlock.  In  his  "  Stewartiana,"  Mr  Riddell  quotes  an  inqui- 
sition, made  in  1185,  by  Galfrid  Fitz-Stephen,  into  all  previous  grants 
in  favour  of  the  Knight-Templars,  where  we  find  "  Apud  Carditonam 
ex  dono  Willielmi  filii  Alani  tota  villa  de  Carditona  et  Huchmerse,  ex 
dimidia  villa  de  Chatterville  et  confirmatione  domini  regis.  .  .  .  Adam 
Albus  pro  dimidia  virgata  XL  eli.  Apud  Covetone  ex  dono  Walteri 
filii  Alani  Robertus  et  Hanno  filius  pro  i  virgata  Vs."  Mr  Riddell 
calls  this  a  "clinching  proof"  of  the  first  High  Steward's  connection 
with  Shropshire.  "  Carditona "  is  Cardington  in  Shropshire,  lying  in 
Oswestry  Hundred,  and  in  the  vicarage  of  Wenlock.  "  Coveton  "  is 
Cotton  in  Shropshire,  also  in  Oswestry  Hundred,  and  in  the  old 
writings  of  the  place  is  styled  Coveton.  The  "  Liber  Niger  Saccarii  " 
contains  a  list  of  English  fiefs  from  1 100  to  11 54,  in  the  reign  of  Henry 
L,  and  among  the  vassals  of  "  Willielmi  filii  Alani "  there  is  mentioned 
"  Walterus  filius  Alani,"  as  holding  "  feodum  11  militum."  It  appears, 
also,  from  the  Harleian  MS.  in  the  British  Museum,  that  William,  pro- 
bably between  1155  and  11 60,  "invested"  his  brother  in  his  Sussex 
manor  of  Stoke,  and  "  this  feoffment  must  have  been  over  and  above 
those  two  knights'  fees  of  new  feoffment,  which,  in  1165,  Walter  Fitz- 
Alan  is  said  to  have  held  in  the  barony  of  his  nephew.  Walter  had 
revisited  England  at  his  brother's  restoration  in  1 155,  after  the  accession 
of  Henry  II." 

Holinshed  writes  : — "  Walter  proved  a  man  of  greater  courage  and 
valiance  than  any  other  had  been  commonly  found,  and  there  reigned 
in  him  a  certain  stoutness  of  stomach  ready  to  attempt  high  enter- 
prises." 

Walter  was  appointed,  by  David  I.,   High  Steward  of  Scotland,  and 
was  the  first  to  hold  that  great  ofiice,  the  chief,  under  the  king,  in  the 


monarchy.  Down  to  the  beginning  of  the  present  century,  Brown 
and  other  genealogists  were  of  opinion  that  two  members  of  the  House 
of  Stewart,  Walter  and  Alan,  held  that  office  before  "  Walterus  filius 
Alani."  Pinkerton,  about  1775,  pointed  out  the  probability  that  the 
origin  of  the  family,  and  that  of  the  noble  English  race  of  Fitz-Alan 
would  probably  be  found  to  be  identical,  and  this  was  followed  up,  as 
we  have  seen,  by  Chalmers.  "  Walterus  filius  Alani "  could  not  have 
been  the  son  of  Fleanchus  ;  and  the  older  genealogists,  searching  for 
members  of  the  family  to  fill  the  blank  space  of  time,  found  one  man, 
Alan  or  Alden,  who  witnessed  charters  of  Gospatrick,  Earl  of  Nor- 
thumberland— afterwards,  from  1146  to  1166,  Earl  of  Dunbar, — to 
the  religious  houses  at  Durham  and  Melros.  This  Alden  designed 
himself  "  Alden  Dapifer,"  and  he  was  supposed  to  be  the  father  of 
"  Walterus  filius  Alani."  As  a  Walter  was  manifestly  first  High 
Steward,  they  were  compelled  to  interpolate  another  Walter,  as  father 
of  Alan  or  Alden.  Duncan  Stewart,  M.A.,  in  his  "  History  of  the 
Stewarts,"  published  in  1739,  was  evidently  puzzled  with  this  Alden, 
and  thought  he  might  be  Steward  or  "  Dapifer  "  to  Gospatric,  and  later 
investigations  show  that  he  was  right.  A  little  later.  Sir  David  Dal- 
rymple,  in  his  "  Annals,"  declared  that  Walter,  who  lived  in  the  reigns 
of  David  I.  and  Malcolm  IV.,  was,  indeed,  Steward  of  Scotland;  but 
that  there  was  at  that  time  no  authentic  knowledge  of  the  family 
previous  to  him. 

The  proofs,  besides  those  already  quoted,  that  Walter,  the  first 
High  Steward  of  Scotland,  was  brother  to  William  Fitz-Alan,  seem 
ample.  As  witness  to  the  charters  of  David  I.,  and  in  his  own,  he 
always  subscribed  himself  "Walterus  filius  Alani."  He  founded,  about 
1 160,  the  Abbey  of  Paisley  for  monks  of  the  Cluniac  order  of  Reformed 
Benedictines,  whom  he  brought  from  Wenlock  in  Shropshire.  The 
first  actual  settlement  of  the  monks  was  at  the  Inch  of  Renfrew,  in  the 
neighbourhood  of  the  residence  of  the  founder,  the  church  being  dedi- 
cated to  St  Mary  and  St  James.     It  has,  indeed,  been  supposed  that 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


the  original  intention  of  the  Steward  was  that  they  should  be  per- 
manently seated  there,  but  the  terms  of  the  charter  seem  to  make  it 
more  probable  that  it  was  not  proposed  that  their  settlement  on  the 
Isle  should  be  other  than  temporary,  and  merely  until  the  house  at 
Paisley  should  be  ready  for  their  reception.  The  first  grant  was  that 
of  "  the  church  of  Passelet,  with  two  ploughs  of  land,"  followed  by  the 
confirmation  of  Walter's  charter  to  the  monks  of  St  Milburga  of 
Wenlock,  of  this  grant  on  the  Inch  or  Isle  of  Renfrew.  While  the 
monks  were  still  seated  on  this  island,  they  received  from  Walter  a 
further  grant,  confirmed  by  Malcolm  IV.,  of  various  lands  in  Roxburgh- 
shire, Haddingtonshire,  and  Renfrewshire.  A  few  years  after  their 
settlement  on  the  Inch  of  Renfrew,  the  monks  removed  to  Paisley, 
where  their  house  was  still  more  munificently  endowed,  the  Inch  of 
Renfrew  being  subsequently  resigned  to  the  grandson  of  the  founder 
for  certain  other  lands.  The  charter  to  the  monastery  is  in  Latin,  and 
the  following  is  a  translation  of  the  preamble  : — "  Be  it  known  to  all 
present  and  to  come,  that  I,  Walter,  the  son  of  Alan,  High  Steward  to 
the  King  of  Scotland,  for  the  soul  of  King  David,  King  Henry,  and 
Earl  Henry,  and  also  for  the  soul  of  King  Malcolm,  and  of  myself,  and 
of  my  wife  and  heirs,  and  also  for  the  souls  of  my  ancestors  and  bene- 
factors, for  the  honour  of  God  and  of  the  blessed  Virgin  Mary,  erect  a 
certain  house  of  religion  below  my  land  of  Paisley  (of  the  order  of  the 
brotherhood  of  Wenlock),  viz.,  according  to  the  order  of  Clugny,  with 
the  concurrent  consent  of  the  convent  of  Wenlock,  and  for  the  erecting 
of  that  house  I  have  thirteen  of  the  brotherhood  of  Wenlock,"  etc. 
The  Earl  Henry  was  the  only  son  of  David  I.,  and  King  Henry  was 
the  King  of  England,  to  whom  we  have  seen  the  family  of  Fitz-Alan 
was  so  much  indebted.  The  connection  of  the  Fitz-Alans  with  Clune 
and  Wenlock  has  been  already  fully  noticed.  The  monastery  of 
Wenlock  was  founded  by  Roger  de  Montgomery,  Earl  of  Shrewsbury. 
Among  those  who  accompanied  Walter  from  Shropshire  was  "Robert  de 
Mundegumbri,"  on  whomWalter  bestowed  the  manor  of  Eglisham,granted 


to  him  by  David  I.,  and  it  was  until  very  recently  held  by  the  Earl  of 
Eglinton,  the  representative  of  the  family  of  Montgomerie  in  Scotland. 
The  Melros  Chronicle  says,  that  in  1169  "  Humbardus  Prior  de 
Weneloc  adduxit  conventum  apud  Passelet,  qui  est  juxta  Renfriew." 
Among  other  witnesses  formerly  connected,  like  the  founder,  with 
Shropshire,  are  Robert  de  Mundegumbri,  Robert,  Geoffrey,  and  Walter 
de  Costentin,  Richard  Wall:,  Robert  de  Nesse,  Alan  the  grantor's  son, 
and  Alexander  de  Hasting.  By  the  chartulary  of  Paisley  it  appears  that 
Walter  gave  Humbard  for  his  services  some  lands  and  right  of  herring 
fishing  in  Clydesdale,  but  that  he  afterwards  gave  in  exchange  for  them 
some  land  in  the  south-west  of  Sussex,  where  Walter  possessed  other 
properties. 

In  1334  John  Baliol  having  been  put,  by  the  help  of  Edward  III., 
in  temporary  occupation  of  the  Scottish  throne,  confiscated  the  whole 
possessions  of  Robert  Stewart,  son  of  Walter  Stewart  and  Marjory 
Bruce,  the  High  Steward.     In  1335  Richard  Fitzalan,  Earl  of  Arundel, 
who  had  accompanied  Edward  III.  into  Scotland,  claimed  the  forfeited 
office  as  his  by  hereditary  right,  and  sold  it  to  Edward  for  1000  merks. 
The  claim  was,  of  course,  illusory,  as  Richard  Fitzalan  could  have  no 
shadow  of  right  to  the  office  till  all  the  descendants  of  Walter,  first 
Steward,  were  extinct ;  and  though  it  was  only  made  to  give  Edward 
a  pretence  for  interfering  further  in  Scottish  affairs,  it  shows  the  con- 
nection   at   that   time    recognised   as    existing    between    the   families. 
Edward  obtained  from   Baliol,  in   1340,  a  confirmation  of  this  trans- 
action, a  record  of  which  is  still  extant  in  the  English  Crown  Archives. 
The  charter  given  by  Walter  to  the  monastery  of  Paisley  was 
signed  a.d.  1160,  at  Fotheringhay  Castle  in  Northamptonshire,  a  manor 
inherited  by   Malcolm    IV.,  along  with  the  earldom  of  Huntingdon. 
Malcolm  was  there  at  that  time,  doing  homage  for  his  English  lands  to 
Henry  II.,  who  was  then  at  Wodstoke,  not  far  distant  from  Malcolm's 
castle  of  Fotheringhay,  which  was  destined  to  be  the  place  of  the  im- 
prisonment and  execution,  rather  more  than  four  hundred  years  later, 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


of  his  unhappy  descendant  Queen  Mary,  in  1587.  The  monastery 
was  dedicated  generally  to  God  and  the  blessed  Virgin,  and,  in  par- 
ticular, to  St  James,  St  Milburga,  and  St  Mirin,  and  it  eventually 
numbered  under  its  patronage  thirty-one  churches,  as  appears  from  its 
chartulary,  which  comes  down  to  1548.  The  foundation  was  confirmed 
by  King  William  the  Lion,  and  also  by  Pope  Innocent  III.,  and  by 
Stephen,  abbot  of  the  parent  house  of  Cluny  in  Burgundy.  On  the  seal 
of  the  abbey  is,  says  Laing,  "  a  figure  of  St  James  with  pilgrim's  staff 
and  scrip,  at  each  side  a  shield,  the  dexter  bearing  a  fess  chequ6  for 
Stewart,  the  sinister  a  saltire  cantoned  with  four  roses  for  Lennox," 
the  great  Lords  of  Lennox  and  the  Isles  being  also  munificent  benefac- 
tors of  the  Abbey.  It  was  one  of  the  four  holy  places  in  Scotland  to 
which  pilgrimages  were  made,  the  others  being  Scone,  Dundee,  and 
Melrose. 

Dr  Lees,  in  his  history  of  the  Abbey  of  Paisley,  says  that  St 
James  was  peculiarly  the  patron  saint  of  the  Stewarts,  and  that  St  Mil- 
burga was  the  founder  and  the  patron  saint  of  Wenlock,  the  oldest  and 
the  most  wealthy  of  the  religious  houses  of  Shropshire.  St  Milburga 
was  daughter  of  Merewald,  the  Christian  founder  of  Leominster  Priory, 
and  granddaughter  of  Penda,  last  Saxon  pagan  king  of  Mercia.  St 
Mirin  was  a  Celtic  Saint,  a  pupil  of  St  Cougal,  Abbot  of  Bangor,  and 
the  friend  and  frequent  visitor  of  St  Columba  at  lona.  St  Mirin's 
name  is  frequently  found  in  Scots  Kalendars,  and  he  is  distinguished 
as  the  first  preacher  of  Christianity  to  the  natives  of  Clydesdale.  Dr 
Lees  and  others,  who  hold  that  Walter  was  of  Norman  lineage,  express 
surprise  that  he  should  have  selected  a  Saxon  and  a  Celtic  saint  as 
patrons  of  his  munificently  endowed  Church  at  Paisley ;  but  his  own 
Celtic  and  Saxon  descent  fully  account  for  the  choice,  which,  indeed, 
could  otherwise  hardly  be  explained. 

Malcolm  IV.  confirmed  the  grants  of  land  which  David  I.  had  made 
to  Walter,  and  also  that  of  the  office  of  High  Steward,  making  it  heredi- 
tary in  his  family.     The  following  is  the  translation  of  the  charter,  as 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


given  by  Crawford  : — "  Malcolm,  King  of  Scots,  to  the  bishops,  abbots, 
barons,  justices,  sheriffs,  provosts,  officers,  and  all  good  men,  clergy, 
laity,  French  and  English,  Scots,  and  inhabitants  of  Galloway,  through 
all  his  dominions,  both  present  and  to  come,  greeting.  Be  it  known  to 
all  men  that  before  I  took  up  arms,  I  granted,  and  have  by  this,  my 
charter,  confirmed  in  hereditary  succession  to  Walter,  the  son  of  Alan, 
my  high  Steward,  and  to  his  heirs  in  fee  farm  and  inheritance,  my  High 
Stewardship  to  be  held  by  him  and  his  heirs  as  well  and  fully  as  King 
David  granted  him  his  High  Stewardship.  I  further  confirm  the  grant 
which  King  David,  my  grandfather,  gave  him,  namely,  of  the  lands  of 
Renfrew,  Paisley,  Pollok,  Tullok,  Cathcart,  Le  Drep,  Eglisham,  Loch- 
winnoch  and  Innerwick,  Inchinan,  Hastenden,  Legerwood,  and  Birchen- 
side,  with  all  the  pertinents  of  these  lands,  and  in  every  burgh  and 
regality  to  me  belonging,  one  full  toft,  and  with  every  toft  twenty  acres 
of  land  for  his  entertainment  therein,  and  for  giving  me  and  my  heirs 
for  that  fee  farm,  the  service  of  five  soldiers  ('  milites,'  which  should  be 
more  properly  translated  knights). 

"  At  the  castle  of  Roxburgh,  on  the  feast  of  St  John  the  Baptist,

Ernest,  Bishop  of  St  Andrews  ;  Herbert,  Bishop  of  Glasgow ;  John, 
Abbot  of  Kelkow  (Kelso) ;  William,  Abbot  of  Melros  ;  Walter,  the 
Chamberlain ;  William  and  David,  brothers  of  the  King ;  Earl  Gos-

A  copy  of  the  above  charter,  in  Latin,  is  among  the  Harleian  MS., 
in  the  British  Museum,  on  folio  45,  in  the  handwriting  of  Sir  James 
Balfour,  where  it  also  appears  (folio  44)  that  this  had  been  taken  from 
a  manuscript  of  the  handwriting  of  Sir  John  Skene,  Clerk- Register  of 
Scotland,  who  had  copied  it  from  the  original. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Walter  witnessed  many  charters  of  King  David — one  of  a  grant  to 
Melros  Abbey,  passed  in  June  1142,  at  Ercheldon  ;  one  in  favour  of 
May  Priory,  dated  at  Kyngor ;  and  also  of  a  charter  in  favour  of  the 
Church  at  Glasgow,  together  with  Willielmus  Cuming,  Cancellarius, 
Hugo  de  Morevilla,  Ferg.  de  Galweia,  Hugh  Breton,  and  others.  He 
also  witnessed  a  charter  of  Prince  Henry  of  Scotland,  "  Henricus  Comes," 
to  Holm  Cultram,  which  must  have  passed  after  the  foundation  of  that 
house  in  January  1 1 50,  and  before  the  death  of  the  Prince  in  May  or  June 
1152. 

There  is  also  a  charter  in  the  Scots  College  at  Paris  of  a  grant  by 
"  Henricus  Comes,"  in  favour  of  the  Church  of  St  John  of  the  Castle  of 
Roxburgh,  signed  at  Traquair,  without  date,  which  is  witnessed  by 
Walter.  He  was  also  witness  to  a  charter  by  Ricardus  de  Moreville, 
Constabularius  Regni  Scotise,  granted  about  1 1 70.  The  De  Morevilles, 
from  Burgh,  in  Cumberland,  were  very  powerful  in  Scotland  under 
David  I.,  Malcolm  IV.,  and  William  the  Lion.  They  held  hereditarily 
the  office  of  High  Constable,  founded  the  Abbey  of  Dryburgh,  and 
almost  certainly  that  of  Kilwinning,  and  they  were  also  great  benefac- 
tors of  Melros  Abbey.  The  male  line  ended  in  11 96  in  the  person  of 
William.  He  died  s.p.,  and  his  sister,  Elena,  marrying  Roland,  Lord  of 
Galloway,  carried  to  her  husband  the  high  offices  and  large  estates  of  the 
De  Morevilles.  Through  the  marriage  of  Robert  de  Brus,  great-great- 
great-grandfather  of  King  Robert  the  Bruce,  with  the  heiress  of  Gallo- 
way and  Annandale,  these  powerful  Celtic  Lords  of  Galloway,  which 
then  comprehended  not  only  the  Shire  of  Wigton  and  the  Stewartry  of 
Kirkcudbright,  but  also  a  portion  of  Dumfries-shire  and  a  large  part  of 
Ayrshire,  were  the  ancestors,  on  the  maternal  side,  of  the  Stewart  Kings. 
In  the  charter  by  Malcolm  IV.,  Walter  is  termed  "  Senescallus,"  and 
he  signed  himself  at  different  times  "  Dapifer "  and  "  Senescallus." 
Duncan  Stewart  says  the  derivation  of  Senescallus  is  from  two  old 
German  words,  "  Senes,"  signifying  old,  principal,  or  chief,  and  "  Scale," 
a  servant ;  in  the  Gaelic,  the  cognate  words  are  "  Sean  "  and  "  Sgalag," 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


having  the  same  meaning.  He  also  derives  the  name  of  Stewart  from  two 
Saxon  words,  "Sti,"  a  house,  and  "Ward"  or  "Wart,"  a  guardian  or  keeper. 

In  Douglas's  Peerage,  we  find  Ducange's  description,  of  the  office 
of  Senescallus  as  follows  : — "  Senescallus  (Steward),  said  to  be  derived 
from  Sennen,  a  herd,  and  Schalc,  a  servant,  was  the  first  ofiice  under 
the  crown  ;  he  was  not  only  chief  of  the  household,  but  his  power,  from 
the  confidence  acquired  by  that  station,  extended  to  the  collection  and 
management  of  the  revenue,  to  the  administration  of  justice,  and  even 
to  the  chief  direction  in  war.  It  being  found  in  France  a  power  too 
vast  for  a  subject,  the  power  was  there  subdivided." 

Sir  Henry  Steuart,  of  Allanton,  in  his  letter  to  Andrew  Stuart, 
M.P.,  in  refutation  of  some  statements  made  by  the  latter  in  his  "Genea- 
logy of  the  Stewarts,"  gives  the  following  explanation  of  the  variety 
of  ways  in  which  the  name  has,  in  later  days,  been  spelled.  "  I  shall 
here,"  he  says,  "take  an  opportunity  of  accounting  for  the  various 
manners  in  which  the  name  of  Stewart  is  written.  Surnames,  accord- 
ing to  the  best  accounts,  were  invented  by  the  Normans  in  the  Twelfth 
Century.  About  the  beginning  of  the  Thirteenth,  they  were  intro- 
duced into  this  island ;  and  Walter,  the  fifth  Lord  High  Steward 
of  Scotland,  who  died  about  a.d.  1241,  was  the  first  who  settled  the 
name  of  Stewart  on  his  posterity.  Being  obviously  derived  from  the 
office,  Stewart  is,  beyond  question,  the  most  ancient  and  the  most  proper 
orthography.  But  different  races,  in  process  of  time,  have  found  it  con- 
venient to  alter  it,  either  in  order  to  mark  their  own  particular  descent 
or  to  distinguish  them  from  others  of  the  same  origin.  Accordingly, 
we  find  that  Stewart,  Steuart,  and  Stuart,  have  been  common  among 
numbers.  The  long  and  intimate  connection  between  Scodand  and 
France  appears  to  have  given  rise  to  the  idea  of  discarding  the  w  from 
the  word,  and  writing  Stuart  instead  of  Stewart ;  as  the  French,  who 
are  without  the  '  w '  in  their  alphabet,  first  set  the  example.  The  prac- 
tice, it  is  supposed,  first  originated  with  Sir  John  Stewart,  of  Darnley, 
soon  after  the  notable  campaigns  which  he  served  in  France,  in  the 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIxV. 


beginning  of  the  Fifteenth  Century.  But  it  has  been  most  generally, 
and  most  erroneously,  applied  to  the  Royal  Family  by  historians. 

Queen  Mary,  from  a  natural  partiality  to  the  French  manners, 
also  contributed  to  bring  this  innovation  into  fashion.  But  King  James 
VI.,  her  son,  condemned  the  alteration  from  the  former  orthography,  by 
introducing,  in  several  of  his  charters  and  letters  patent,  clauses  tending 
to  restore  the  latter.  The  rule  seems  to  be  that  when  the  name  in 
general  is  written,  it  should  certainly  be  Stewart ;  the  office  Steward,  and 
in  the  case  of  particular  families,  that  mode  of  orthography  ought  to  be 
followed,  which  they  themselves  have  long  been  in  the  habit  of  using." 
Walter  is  said  to  have  defeated  Somerled,  Thane  of  Argyll,  and 
ancestor  of  the  Macdonalds,  the  MacDougalls,  and  the  various  other 
branches  of  the  family  of  the  Lords  of  the  Isles,  in  an  attempt  to 
ravage  the  Barony  of  Renfrew,  a.d.  1164  (according  to  Sir  James  Bal- 
four, in  1 161),  when  Somerled's  son  Gillecolane  was  killed.  Sir  Robert 
Douglas  says  both  Somerled  and  his  son  were  killed. 

In  addition  to  his  munificent  gifts  to  the  Abbey  of  Paisley,  Walter 
was  a  benefactor  to  Kelso,  a  monastery  of  the  Cistercian  order  founded 
by  King  David  I.,  Dunfermline,  founded  by  Malcolm  III.,  Cupar,  and 
Melros.  To  Kelso  he  gave  lands  near  Roxburgh,  an  acre  in  Molle, 
and  two  parcels  of  land  in  Renfrew ;  to  Dunfermline  he  gave  a  toft  in 
his  burgh  of  Renfrew,  another  in  Innerkeithing,  and  on  the  day  that 
King  Malcolm  was  buried  twenty-four  acres  lying  in  the  bounds  of  the 
burgh.  To  Melrose  he  gave,  about  11 70,  the  lands  of  Edmunstune 
and  Machline,  and  those  of  the  Shiels  on  the  north  side  of  the  river 
Ayr,  with  fishings,  and  one  carucate  of  laboured  land,  bounded  by 
Duveglass,  Lesmahago,  and  Glengevel.  His  charter  to  Melros  is  yet  in 
existence,  and  a  representation  of  his  seal  attached  thereto  is  given  in 
the  Plate  on  the  preceding  page  (fig.  i).  For  this  valuable  and  interest- 
ing addition  to  this  work  the  authors  are  indebted  to  the  courtesy  of 
the  Duke  of  Buccleuch  and  Queensberry,  who  permitted  an  impression 
— from  which  the  plates  in  this  volume  have  been  reproduced — to  be 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


taken  from  the  original  plate  engraved  for  the  Liber  de  Melros,  his 
Grace's  contribution  to  the  Bannatyne  Club.  Mr  Henry  Laing,  whose 
descriptions  of  these  and  subsequent  seals  are  quoted,  says  : — "  This  is 
rudely  executed,  and  much  defaced,  yet  it  is  extremely  interesting,  as 
being  probably  the  earliest  seal  in  existence  of  this  great  family.  The 
design  is  an  armed  knight  on  horseback  at  full  speed,  a  lance  with  pen- 
non, couched  in  his  right  hand,  and  a  shield  on  his  left  arm.  sigillum 
WALTERi  FiLii  ALANi  DAPiFERi  REG."  The  counterseal  (fig.  i)  is  "equally 
interesting.  Unfortunately,  the  Impression  is  very  imperfect ;  but  it 
has  evidently  been  an  antique  gem,  in  a  broad  setting,  on  which  was 
cut  the  inscription,  now  illegible.  The  design  seems  to  be  a  warrior 
with  a  spear  in  his  right  hand,  leaning  against  a  pillar,  and  with  his  left 
hand  holding  his  horse.  These  seals  afford  a  presumption  that  as  yet 
the  family  used  no  coat  armour."  The  witnesses  to  the  charter  are 
Alan,  the  grantor's  son,  Robert  de  Montegumeri,  Walter  Costetin, 
Richard  Wallensis,  and  Adam  de  Newtun. 

Walter  married  Eschina,  sister  of  Alan,  fifth  Earl  of  Athole  (in 
right  of  his  wife,  eldest  granddaughter  of  Henry,  fourth  Earl  of  Athole), 
and  daughter  of  Thomas  de  Londoniis,  who  had  been  appointed  by 
William  the  Lion  "  Hostiarius,"  or  Door  ward,  an  office  which  became 
hereditary  in  the  family,  and  from  which  they  assumed  the  surname  of 
Durward.  Thomas  was  son  of  Malcolm  de  Londiniis,  who  received 
from  Malcolm  IV.  the  lands  of  Lundin  in  Forfarshire,  when  his  brother 
Philip  obtained  from  the  same  monarch  the  barony  also  called  Lundin, 
near  Largo,  in  Fife.  Eschina  was  the  widow  of  Henry  de  Molla,  and 
brought  to  her  second  husband  the  baronies  of  Molla  and  Huntlaw 
in  Teviotdale,  Roxburghshire.  Gordon  says,  in  his  "  Monasticon," 
"  Eschina  de  Londiniis,  the  wife  of  Henry  of  Molle,  gave  to  Kelso  a 
confirmatory  charter  in  1 185,  to  the  convent,  of  the  church  of  Molle,  its 
lands  and  liberties."  In  her  charter,  circa  a.d.  1190,  in  favour  of  the 
Abbey  of  Kelso,  the  grant  is  made  for  the  souls  of  her  "  lords,"  Walter 
the  Steward  and  Henry  of  Molle.     These  estates  of  Molla  and  Hunt-

law  remained  in  the  family  of  Stewart  for  many  generations,  as  King 
Robert  III.  erected  all  the  lands  of  the  Stewart  of  Scotland,  which 
were  either  in  the  Baronies  of  Renfrew,  or  in  Kyle  Stewart  in  Ayrshire, 
as  well  as  also  their  lands  of  Molla,  Huntlaw,  and  Hassendean  in  Rox- 
burghshire, and  the  lands  of  Orde  in  the  shire  of  Peebles,  into  a  Rega- 
lity "  in  honorem  Dei,  Beatse  Virginis  Maris,  et  Beato  Jacobo  Apos- 
tolo,  et  Sancto  Mirino  Confessori,  pro  salute  animae  suae,  et  animarum 
antecessorum  Regum,  Senescallorum  Scotiae."  The  chartulary  of 
Paisley  shows  that  Eschina  granted  to  the  prior  and  monks  of  Paisley 
a  carucate,  or  one  hundred  acres  of  land,  with  pasturage  for  fifty  oxen, 
for  the  welfare  of  the  souls  of  the  Kings  of  Scotland  and  England, 
Walter  her  husband,  herself,  her  son  Alan,  and  Margaret,  her  daughter, 
who  died  unmarried,  and  was  buried  at  Paisley.  Among  the  witnesses 
to  this  charter  are  her  husband,  "  Walterus  filius  Alani,"  described  as 
"  Dominus  meus,"  and  "  Alanus  filius  ejus." 

The  last  grant  of  Walter  to  his  church  at  Paisley  is  that  of  an 
annual  payment  of  two  chalders  of  meal  for  the  support  of  a  monk  to 
pray  for  the  soul  of  Robert  de  Brus,  showing  an  early  connection  be- 
tween the  houses  of  Stewart  and  Bruce,  a  relation  which  became  more 
close  in  later  years.  Ramsay  says  that  towards  the  close  of  his  life 
Walter  assumed  the  monastic  habit,  and  passed  the  evening  of  his  days 
within  the  hallowed  precincts  of  the  Abbey  of  Melrose,  where  he  died 
in  1 177.  In  the  Chronicle  of  Melros  there  is  the  following  record  of 
his  death:  "Anno  Domini  1 1 77  obiit  Walterus,  filius  Alani,  Dapifer 
Regis  Scotise,  qui  fundavit  Pasleto,  cujus  beata  anima  vivit  in  gloria," 
Fordun  says  he  died  in  11 78,  but  the  different  periods  from  which,  in 
those  days,  the  commencement  of  the  year  was  computed,  often  caused 
such  discrepancies  in  dates.  Walter  was  buried  at  Paisley,  which  con- 
tinued to  be  the  burying  place  of  the  Stewarts  till  they  ascended  the 
throne ;  indeed,  after  their  accession,  it  was  occasionally  employed  as 
their  place  of  sepulture. 

Alan,  son  and   heir  of  Walter,  succeeded  his  father  in  1 177,  as 

D 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


High  Steward  of  Scotland  under  King  William  the  Lion,  who  had 
been  crowned,  on  the  death  of  his  brother  Malcolm,  on  the  24th  De- 
cember 1165.  Alan  accompanied  Philip  II.,  King  of  France,  Richard 
Coeur  de  Lion,  and  David  Earl  of  Huntingdon,  in  the  third  Crusade, 
against  Saladin,  about  1191.  On  his  return  from  Palestine  he  led  an 
army  against  rebels  in  the  north  of  Scotland,  under  Harold,  Earl  of 
Caithness  and  Orkney,  whose  son  Roderick  he  killed  in  battle  with  his 
own  hand.  The  rebels  were  defeated,  and  the  southern  part  of  Harold's 
lands  given  to  Hugh  Freskin,  grandson  of  Freskin  the  Fleming,  and 
progenitor  of  the  Dukes  of  Sutherland. 

Alan  gave  the  patronage  of  the  church  of  Kingarf,  in  the  isle  of 
Bute,  with  the  tithes  of  all  the  churches  and  chapels  within  that  island, 
to  the  monastery  of  Paisley.  To  the  Abbey  of  Melros  he  gave  a  pas- 
turage on  the  west  side  of  the  river  Leader,  the  lands  of  Baremor  and 
Godeneth,  as  well  as  those  of  Monabroc  in  Strathgrief,  with  an  annuity 
of  five  merks,  which  had  been  payable  to  him  out  of  the  lands 
of  Mauchlyn  by  the  monks  of  Melros ;  and  also  an  annual  sum  from 
his  lands  of  Thirlstane  in  Lauderdale  to  buy  wax  candles  for  the  altar 
of  St  Mary  at  Melros.  He  gave  to  Cupar  a  toft  in  his  burgh  of 
Renfrew,  and  the  liberty  of  a  net  for  fishing  salmon  in  the  Clyde ;  and 
to  Kelso  many  lands  lying  in  his  barony  of  Inverwick.  He  also 
granted,  apparently  in  early  life,  and  in  confirmation  of  his  father's  pre- 
vious gift,  the  church  of  Mauchline,  and  his  lands  of  Mauchline,  to 
Melros  Abbey,  together  with  the  pasturage  of  his  forests  as  far  as  the 
marches  of  Duneglas  and  Lesmahago,  and  Glengarvil.  An  engraving 
of  the  seal  attached  to  this  charter  will  be  found  at  p.  23  (fig.  3).  "It 
is,"  says  Laing,  "  much  defaced.  An  armed  knight  on  horseback,  a 
sword  in  his  right  hand,  and  a  shield  on  his  left  arm.  The  inscription 
is  indistinct,  but  the  following  may  be  read — '  s  alain  .  fi  .  watir  . 
L  .  Fi  .  AL  .  SENESCHALL  .  RE  .  SCO,'  which  may  be  '  Sigillum  Alain  le 
Fitz  Watir  le  Fjtz  Alain  Senescalli  Regis  Scotiae.'  "  The  witnesses  to 
this  deed  are   Reginald  de    Hasting,  William  de  Lindesei,  Walter  de 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Constentin,  Adam  de  Neueton.  The  same  Alan,  renouncing  at  a 
later  period  his  claim  to  certain  lands  in  Blenselei — probably  Blainsli 
in  Lauderdale — in  favour  of  Melrose  Abbey,  sealed  his  charter  with  a 
seal,  a  representation  of  which  is  given  at  page  23  (fig.  2).  It  is  "  of  a 
similar  design,  but  in  a  much  improved  style  of  art.  The  remains  of  a 
fess  chequ6  is  quite  apparent  upon  the  shield,  and  is  perhaps  the 
earliest  instance  of  this  well-known  bearing  of  the  Stewart  family — 
siGiLL  .  ALANi  FiLii  WALTERi."  Alan  also  gave  to  the  Abbey  of  Cam- 
bus  Kenneth  a  full  toft  in  the  Burgh  of  Renfrew,  and  one  fishing  in 
the  water  of  the  same  village. 

Alan  was  witness  to  a  charter  by  William  the  Lion,  confirming  an 
agreement  between  the  Bishop  of  Glasgow  and  Robert  de  Brus,  concern- 
ing certain  churches  in  Annandale,  signing  as  "  Alanus  Dapifer."  In  the 
chartulary  of  the  Bishopric  of  Glasgow,  preserved  at  the  Scots  College 
at  Paris,  there  is  a  convention  between  the  Bishop  of  Glasgow  and 
Roger  de  Vallens,  as  to  the  church  of  Kilbride,  which  was  signed  in 
presence  of  "His  testibus,  Domino  Rege ;  Comite  Patricio;  Roberto 
Capellano ;  Hug.  Clerico ;  Ric  de  Moreville,  Const.  Regis ;  Alano 
Dapifero  Regis ;  Philippo  de  Vallen  ;  Adamo  filio  Gilberti ;  Waltero 
de  Berkely,  Cam.  Regis." 

Alan  married  Eve,  daughter  of  Suan,  the  son  of  Thor,  Lord  of 
Tippermuir  and  Tranent,  a  person  of  great  account  at  that  time.  Suan 
was  a  benefactor  of  Scone  Abbey,  as  appears  from  a  confirmation  by 
Walter  Stewart,  his  grandson ;  he  also  gave  to  the  Abbey  of  Holyrood 
all  right  he  had  in  the  church  of  "  Trevernent,"  its  lands,  pastures,  and 
tithes.  Alan  gave  a  donation  of  land  to  the  Canons  of  St  Andrews, 
for  the  salvation  of  the  souls  of  the  Kings  David  and  Malcolm,  of  his 
father's,  of  his  own,  and  of  that  of  his  wife  Eve.  Simson  says  he 
married  a  second  wife,  Alesta,  daughter  of  Morgund,  Earl  of  Mar. 
Alan  died  in  1204,  and  was  buried  before  the  high  altar  at  Paisley, 
leaving  two  sons — 

I.  Walter,  who  succeeded  him. 


2.  David,  who,  as  appears  from  Rymer's  Fcedera,  was  one  of  the 
guarantors  in  12 19,  that  Alexander  II.,  King  of  Scotland,  should 
marry  Joan,  eldest  daughter  of  John,  King  of  England,  if  her  hand 
could  be  obtained,  and  if  not,  that  he  should  marry  her  sister  Isabella. 
There  is  no  record  of  any  descendants  of  David,  and  he  had  escaped  the 
notice  of  genealogists  till  he  was  pointed  out  by  Sir  David  Dalrymple. 

Walter,  designed  of  Dundonald  in  Ayrshire,  succeeded  his  father 
in  1 204,  and  was  the  first  who  took  the  name  of  Stewart  as  a  surname, 
and  transmitted  it  to  his  posterity ;  the  appellation  having  been  pre- 
viously official,  and  confined  to  the  holder  of  the  office.  Chalmers  says 
the  manor  and  parish  of  Dundonald  belonged  to  Walter  the  first  High 
Steward,  who  held  the  whole  of  the  northern  half  of  Kyle  in  the  begin- 
ning of  the  reign  of  William  the  Lion  ;  it  was,  however,  his  grandson 
Walter  who  was  first  styled  of  Dundonald.  Dundonald  Castle  is  about 
four  miles  south-west  of  Kilmarnock,  and  is  most  picturesquely  situated 
on  the  summit  of  a  detached  and  almost  precipitous  green  "  dun,"  or 
conical  hill,  commanding  an  extensive  view  of  the  Stewart  lands  on 
the  north,  east,  and  south-east,  and  of  Cantyre  and  Knapdale  in  Argyll- 
shire, with  the  islands  of  Bute  and  Arran  on  the  north-west  and  west. 
"It  must  have  been  a  place  of  great  strength  prior  to  the  introduction  of 
artillery.  The  building  is  not  extensive,  the  area  on  which  it  stands  being 
circumscribed.  It  bears,  however,  unequivocal  evidence  of  having  been 
one  of  the  most  magnificent  strongholds  of  the  age.  Besides  the  massive 
oblong  tower — at  least  three  spacious  stories  in  height — the  remains  of 
the  court-yard  and  some  interior  structures  still  exist.  The  arch  over 
the  ground  floor  is  in  good  preservation,  as  well  as  some  of  the  outer 
walls,  particularly  the  north-west,  but  the  stair  is  almost  entirely  gone." 
The  original  castle  on  the  Dun  was,  it  is  supposed,  built  by  some 
Donald,  not  improbably  one  of  the  ancient  Scots  kings,  and  was  in  all 
likelihood  added  to,  and  occupied  occasionally  as  a  residence  by  Walter, 
first  High  Steward,  after  he  had  made  over  to  the  monks,  on  the 
foundation  of  the  monastery  about  1 1 60,  the  dwelling  on  the  rock  at 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Paisley  where  his  hall  was  founded,  "ubi  aula  mea  erat  fundata."  It 
seems,  however,  to  have  been  added  to  more  than  once,  for  in  addition 
to  the  fess  cheque  of  the  Stewarts,  the  lion  of  Scotland  appears  on 
various  parts  of  the  building.  As  the  principal  castle  of  the  Stewarts 
in  their  extensive  barony,  or  rather  principality  of  Kyle  Stewart,  it 
continued  their  chief  seat  in  Ayrshire  for  about  two  hundred  years, 
though  they  had  other  smaller  castles  in  the  district  which  were  either 
their  occasional  residences  or  were  occupied  by  their  vassals.  Among 
these  were,  in  the  Lordship  of  Stewarton,  "  Steuartetoune  Castell,"  now 
forming  part  of  the  modern  mansion  of  Lainshaw,  described  by  Pont 
as  "  a  stronge  old  Dounijon,  the  ancient  inheritance  of  the  predecessors 
of  our  Scotts  Kings  ;"  and,  in  Strath-grief  or  Renfrewshire,  the  manor- 
place  of  Blackhall,  to  which  a  chapel  was  attached,  the  fortalice  of 
Raiss,  and  Renfrew  Castle,  which  will  be  noticed  hereafter. 

King  Robert  II.,  as  appears  from  various  charters,  dated  at  Dun- 
donald,  resided  there,  at  least  occasionally,  during  the  earlier  part  of 
his  reign,  and  from  1388 — when,  enfeebled  by  age,  and  deeply  affected 
by  the  death  of  his  son-in-law  James,  Earl  of  Douglas,  at  the  battle  of 
Otterburn,  he  practically  transferred  the  reins  of  government  to  his 
second  son,  the  Earl  of  Fife — he  lived  there  till  his  death  in  1390. 

"  The  second  Robert  of  Scotland  Kyng 
As  God  purwaid  maid  endying 
At  Downdownald  in  his  countrie 
Of  a  schort  sickness  thare  deyd  he." —  Wyiitnn. 

Robert  III.  also  inhabited  the  castle  for  some  time  after  his  father's 
death,  and  it  is  asserted  by  several  authors  that  he  died  there.  It  con- 
tinued to  be  occasionally  visited  by  the  kings  of  Scotland  until  1468, 
when  James  III.  conferred  it,  with  other  extensive  estates,  on  Thomas 
Boyd,  Earl  of  Arran,  on  his  marriage  with  his  Majesty's  eldest  sister, 
the  Princess  Mary  ;  but  on  the  fall  of  the  family  of  Boyd,  and  the  for- 
feiture of  their  estates  in  the  following  year,  it  returned  into  the  posses- 
sion of  the  Crown.     In   1482,  James  III.  granted  the  custody  of  the 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


castle,  with  the  dominical  lands,  to  Alan,  first  Lord  Cathcart.  In  1527, 
James  V.  granted  a  confirmatory  charter  of  the  castle  and  estate  to 
William  Wallace,  probably  a  cadet  of  the  family  of  Craigie,  in  the  pos- 
session of  whose  descendants  it  remained  till  1638,  when  it  was  sold  to 
Sir  William  Cochrane,  of  Cowden,  the  ancestor  of  the  Earls  of  Dun- 
donald.  In  1726,  the  estate  passed,  by  purchase,  to  the  Eglinton 
family,  with  whom  it  still  continues  ;  the  castle  only,  with  the  surrounding 
seven  or  eight  acres  of  land,  remaining  the  property  of  the  Cochranes. 

Walter  was  witness  to  a  charter  by  William  the  Lion,  granted  at 
Dumfries,  but  without  date,  to  which  the  witnesses  were — Ricardus  de 
Moreville,  Walterus  filius  Alani  Dapifer,  Walterus  Olifar,  Robertus 
de  Quinci,  Willielmus  de  Veteri  Ponte.  The  last  designation  appears 
frequently  afterwards  in  Scots  and  English  charters,  and  was  contracted 
as  a  surname  into  Vipont.  The  family  had  extensive  possessions  in 
Roxburghshire,  and  Alan  de  Vipont  held  the  castle  of  Lochleven  for 
King  David  II.,  after  the  "battle  of  Halidonhill.  The  family  of  De 
Quinci  was  a  very  powerful  one,  both  in  Scotland  and  England,  in  the 
1 2th  and  13th  centuries.  Robert  de  Quinci  came  to  Scotland  in  the 
reign  of  William  the  Lion,  and  got  Leuchars,  in  Fife,  by  his  marriage 
with  Arabella,  daughter  of  Nes.  His  grandson,  Roger,  who  held, 
besides  his  Scottish  barony,  the  Earldom  of  Winchester,  in  England, 
married  Elena,  eldest  daughter  of  Alan,  Lord  of  Galloway  ;  and,  on 
Alan's  death  in  1234,  not  only  shared  the  extensive  estates  of  his 
father-in-law,  but  also  succeeded  to  the  high  office  of  Constable  of  Scot- 
land, which  had  descended  to  the  Lords  of  Galloway  from  the  marriage 
of  Alan  with  Elena,  sister  of  William,  the  last  of  the  De  Morevilles. 
The  office  and  Scots  estates  were  forfeited  during  the  wars  of  the 
succession. 

There  is  a  charter,  with  the  Great  Seal  of  Scotland  attached,  in 
the  Scots  College  at  Paris,  granted  by  Alexander  II.  in  favour  of  the 
Church  at  Glasgow,  dated  at  Ayr,  on  the  8th  May  1223.  The  first 
witness  is  "  Walterus  filius  Alani  Senescallus,"  and  the  names  after  his 


are  Walterus  Olifard,  Roderick  Capellanus,  Ingelram  de  Ballol,  Henri- 
cus  de  Baliol,  Henricus  de  Stivel,  Joannis  de  Macaswell,  Reginaldus  de 
Crawfurd,  Vice  Comes  de  Ar,  Walterus  Bisset.  The  family  of  Bisset 
were  at  this  time  of  importance  in  the  districts  now  chiefly  occupied  by 
the  Frasers,  but  shortly  afterwards  the  heads  of  the  family  were  out- 
lawed on  account  of  their  share  in  the  assassination  of  the  young  Earl  of 
Atholl,  son  of  Thomas  of  Galloway. 

Walter's  earliest  benefaction  to  the  Church  appears  to  have  been  a 
grant,  between  1207  and  12 14,  of  an  annual  rent  of  three  merks  to  the 
Convent  of  Syxle.  His  confirmation  to  Melros  Abbey  assures  four 
carucates  of  land  at  Edmunstune,  as  granted  by  Walter  Fitz-Alan,  his 
grandfather.  His  seal,  p.  23,  fig.  4,  bears  an  armed  knight  on  horse- 
back, a  drawn  sword  in  his  right  hand,  and  on  his  left  arm  a  shield 
bearing  "  a  fess  chequ^,  sigill  walteri  filii  alani."  His  privy  seal, 
p.  23,  fig.  5,  appended  to  a  charter  of  the  lands  of  Molle,  in  excam- 
bion  for  the  lands  of  Freretun,  to  the  Abbey  of  Melros,  bears  simply  a 
fess  cheque.  He  also,  as  Seneschal,  attests  the  deed,  signed  at  York  on 
i8th  June  122 1,  whereby  Alexander  II.  of  Scotland  fixed  the  dower  of 
the  English  Princess  Johanna.  About  1223,  Walter  granted  a  charter 
in  favour  of  the  Church  of  Glasgow,  in  which  he  describes  himself  as 
"  Dapifer  Regis  Scotise,"  showing,  as  pointed  out  by  Ducange,  that 
Dapifer  and  Senescallus  were  names  of  the  same  office.  Alexander  II. 
granted  a  charter,  now  in  the  Scots  College  at  Paris,  also  in  favour 
of  the  Church  at  Glasgow,  dated  8th  February  1237,  to  which  the 
witnesses  were  Walterus  filius  Alani,  Justiciar  Scotiae,  Walter  Cumyn, 
Comes  de  Menteth,  Walterus  Olifard,  Alan  Hostier  (Hostiarius  or 
Doorward),  Walterus  Bysset,  Roger  Avenel,  David  Marscal.  By  this 
it  appears  that  Walter  had,  previous  to  1237,  been  appointed  Justiciary 
of  Scotland  ;  and  Sir  Robert  Douglas  and  Duncan  Stewart  say  that 
the  appointment  was  made  at  St  Andrews  on  the  24th  August  1230. 
In  September  1237,  he  was  one  of  the  commissioners  named  by  Alex- 
ander II.  to  swear  to  the  observance  of  the  peace  agreed  upon  with  Henry 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


III.  In  Winton's  Chronicle,  it  is  said  that  after  the  death  of  Alexan- 
der's first  wife,  the  Princess  Joan  of  England,  Walter  was  sent  in  1238 
as  ambassador  to  France,  to  negotiate  a  marriage  for  King  Alexander 
with  Mary,  daughter  of  Ingerlam,  Lord  of  Coucy,  and  that  he  accom- 
panied her  to  Scotland.  Abercromby  says  that  Walter  went  with  a 
command  to  Palestine,  in  the  Sixth  Crusade  of  1228-40,  and  that  after 
his  return  he  defeated  a  rebellion  raised  by  Thomas  Mac-du-Allan  in 
Galloway. 

About  this  time  the  Pope's  usurpation  of  the  right  of  patronage  of 
monasteries  caused  the  pious  benefactors  of  the  Church  to  erect  colle- 
giate churches  and  chapelries,  the  patronage  of  which  was  reserved  by 
ecclesiastical  canon,  to  the  founders  and  their  heirs.  Walter  founded  a 
religious  house  of  this  kind,  of  the  Gilbertine  order,  at  Dalmulin,  in 
Kyle,  about  two  miles  east  of  Ayr,  endowing  it  with  various  lands  and 
tithes,  among  others,  with  the  church  of  Dundonald  and  its  two  chapels 
of  Richardstoun  and  Crossby.  When  the  Dalmulin  house  was  given  up 
in  1238,  Walter  granted  the  church  of  Dundonald  with  its  two  chapels 
to  the  monks  of  Paisley,  and  also  at  the  same  time  the  church  of  San- 
quhar, as  well  as  that  of  Auchinleck,  with  all  its  pertinents.  He  also 
gave  donations  to  the  Abbeys  of  Kelso  and  Balmerino,  confirmed  his 
father's  charter  of  Mauchline,  and  also  that  of  his  grandfather,  Suan,  of 
lands  to  the  Abbey  of  Scone.  He  further,  according  to  Crawford,  gave 
an  annuity  of  six  chalders  of  meal  for  the  support  of  a  priest  of  Melros, 
to  say  mass  for  the  benefit  of  the  soul  of  Robert  de  Brus,  Lord  of 
Annandale. 

The  following  is  quoted  from  Nisbet's  Heraldry.  "  Walter,  High 
Steward  in  the  reign  of  Alexander  II.,  appended  his  seal  to  a  charter 
confirming  grants  of  lands  upon  the  Water  of  Ayr  to  the  monks  of  Mel- 
ros. The  seal  has  a  man  on  horseback,  in  a  coat  of  mail,  brandishing 
a  sword  with  his  right  hand,  and  on  his  left  arm  a  shield  with  a  fesse 
cheque  of  three  tracts,  and  above  his  head  a  helmet,  with  a  wreath  also 
cheque.     The  fesse  is  a  belt  across  the  shield,  and  meant  to  signify  a

knight's  belt.  The  term  cheque  in  heraldry  is  said  of  the  field,  or  any 
other  charge  or  figure  filled  up  with  square  pieces  alternately  of  differ- 
ent tinctures ;  which  pieces  Monsieur  Baron  will  have  to  represent  in 
armouries,  battalions,  and  squadrons  of  soldiers,  and  are  a  fit  bearing 
for  chief  commanders  of  armies,  as  those  of  the  antient  family  of  Stew- 
art, who  long  before  they  ascended  the  throne,  were  commanders  in 
chief  of  armies  under  our  antient  kings,  and  Lord  High  Stewards  of 
Scotland,  and  were  in  use  always  to  carry  for  their  paternal  ensign,  or, 
a  fesse  chequd,  azure  and  argent." 

Duncan  Stewart,  quoting  Sir  James  Balfour,  says  :  "  The  fesse 
cheque  was  assumed  by  the  Stewarts,  perhaps  because  the  fesse  repre- 
sents a  military  belt,  and  the  fesse  cheque  represents  battalions  and 
squares  of  soldiers  ;  because  the  Stewart  of  Scotland  had  command  of 
the  King's  armies.  Likewise  the  fesse  cheque  represents  the  chess- 
boards, which,  of  old,  accomptants  in  the  King's  office  of  Exchequer 
did  make  use  of  in  calculating  their  accompts.  Whence,  probably,  the 
Exchequer  had  its  name,  and  which  office  was  under  the  High  Stew- 
art. The  seal  of  Walter,  son  of  Alan,  Lord  High  Stewart,  carried  a 
fesse  cheque  very  probably  upon  this  account." 

Walter  married  Beatrix,  daughter  of  Gilchrist,  third  Earl  of 
Angus.  Noble,  in  his  history  of  the  Stewarts,  says  that  the  mother  of 
Beatrix  was  Marjory,  sister  of  Malcolm  IV.  and  William  the  Lion. 
Walter  died  in  1 246,  leaving  issue — 

1.  Alexander,  his  successor. 

2.  John,  killed  at  Damietta  in  Egypt.  Noble  says  he  accom- 
panied his  brother  Alexander  in  the  seventh  Crusade,  led  by  Saint 
Lewis,  King  of  France, 

3.  Walter,  called  Bailloch,  or  the  freckled  ;  designed  in  a  charter  of 
1248,  "  Walterus  filius  Walteri  Senescalli ;  "  and  in  charters  of  1261  and 
1263,  "Walterus  Senescallus,  comes  de  Menteth."  He  accompanied  his 
brothers  to  the  seventh  Crusade  in  1 248,  and  distinguished  himself  at 
the  battle  of  Largs  in   1263.     He  witnessed  the  marriage  contract  of 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


the  Princess  Margaret  with  King  Eric  of  Norway  in  1281,  and,  with 
his  Countess,  accompanied  the  Princess  to  that  country.  In  the  parlia- 
ment of  1283,  he  swore  allegiance  to  the  Maiden  of  Norway  in  the 
event  of  the  death  of  Alexander  III.  In  1292  he  was  one  of  the 
auditors,  on  the  part  of  Bruce,  in  the  competition  for  the  crown.  Dun- 
can Stewart  says  that  he  took  part  in  the  invasions  of  England  in  1295 
and  1296,  and  that  having  surrendered  after  the  battle  of  Dunbar  on 
honourable  conditions,  he  was,  notwithstanding,  put  to  death  in  the 
76th  year  of  his  age.  He  married  the  younger  daughter  of 
Mauritius,  third  Earl  of  Menteth,  and  in  her  right  succeeded  as  fifth 
earl,  on  the  death  of  Walter  Cumyn,  fourth  earl,  in  right  of  his  wife,  the 
elder  sister.  Walter  Cumyn  died  suddenly  in  1258,  and  his  widow 
somewhat  precipitately  married  Sir  John  Russell,  an  English  knight. 
Sir  John  and  his  wife  were  both  imprisoned  on  suspicion  of  having 
poisoned  her  first  husband,  but  were  afterwards  permitted  to  leave  the 
kingdom.  Sir  Walter  Stewart  thereupon  laid  claim  to  the  earldom, 
and  obtained  it  by  favour  of  the  estates  of  the  realm.  His  male  issue 
failing,  the  title  was  carried  by  his  granddaughter  Mary  to  Sir  John 
Graham,  and  by  their  daughter  Margaret's  marriage  with  Robert,  first 
Duke  of  Albany,  third  son  of  Robert  II.,  it  passed  again  to  the  line  of 
the  Stewarts  ;  but  on  the  execution  of  Duke  Murdoch  in  1425,  it  was 
forfeited  and  vested  in  the  Crown.  Walter  was  a  benefactor  of  the 
abbey  of  Kilwinning,  conferring  on  it  the  patronage  of  the  parish 
church  of  St  Charmaig  and  chapel  of  St  Mary  in  Knapdale,  St  Michael 
in  Inverlussa,  together  with  the  lands  in  Riventos  annexed  to  the  said 
church.  He  also  confirmed  to  the  monks  of  Paisley  the  grants  of  Duf- 
gall  the  son  of  Syfyn  regarding  the  church  of  St  Colmanel  with  its 
penny  land,  and  the  chapel  near  the  castle  of  Schypinche,  or  Skipness. 

4.  William,  mentioned  in  some  charters,  of  whose  issue  there  is 
no  account. 

Also  three  daughters  : 

I.   Beatrix,  married  to   Maldwin,   third   Earl   of  Lennox,  great-

grandson  of  Arkyll,  the  Saxon  lord  of  several  baronies  In  Yorkshire 
and  Northumberland,  who,  after  several  insurrections  against  William 
the  Conqueror,  fled  to  Scotland,  where  he  received  from  Malcolm  Can- 
more  the  district  in  the  counties  of  Dumbarton  and  Stirling  called  the 
Lennox.  Her  great-granddaughter,  Margaret,  married  Walter  de  Fas- 
lane,  who  became  Earl  of  Lennox.  He  is  thought  to  have  been  a 
descendant  of  one  of  the  Stewards  of  Scotland,  and  his  seal,  attached 
to  a  charter,  certainly  bore  the  fess  chequ^.  In  reference  to  the  charter 
granted  to  Walter  de  Faslane,  Sir  David  Dalrymple,  Lord  Hailes, 
says  that  words  cannot  express  more  strongly  the  notion  of  those  times 
that  the  possession  of  the  "  Comitatus  "  conferred  the  title  of  "  Comes." 
Their  granddaughter.  Lady  Elizabeth,  married  in  1392  Sir  John  Stew- 
art of  Dernely,  a  descendant  of  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Bonkyl,  and  thus 
the  title  of  Lennox  came  into  that  family. 

2.  Christian,  married  to  Patrick,  sixth  Earl  of  Dunbar.  Lord 
Hailes  calls  him  the  most  powerful  baron  of  the  southern  districts 
of  Scodand.  He  held  the  first  rank  among  the  twenty-four  barons  who 
guaranteed  the  treaty  of  peace  with  England  in  1244.  He  died  at  the 
siege  of  Damietta  in  1248.  J  ^30o''i!2 

3.  Margaret,  married  to  Niel  de  Galloway,  second  Earl  of  Car- 
rick  ;  by  whom  she  had  a  daughter,  Margaret,  Countess  of  Carrick  in 
her  own  right,  who,  after  the  death  of  her  first  husband  Adam  de  Kil- 
conquhar  in  the  Holy  Land  at  the  beginning  of  the  eighth  and  last 
Crusade,  married,  under  well  known  romantic  circumstances,  in  1271, 
Robert  de  Brus,  Lord  of  Annandale  and  Cleveland,  the  eldest  son  of 
the  Competitor,  and  by  him  became  the  mother  of  Robert  the  Bruce, 
afterwards  King  of  Scotland. 

Alexander,  designed  of  Dundonald,  eldest  son  of  Walter,  succeeded 
his  father  in  1246.  He  bound  himself,  under  a  penalty  of  1000  merks, 
to  serve,  along  with  the  Earl  of  Angus,  under  Louis  IX.  of  France, 
for  two  years  against  the  Saracens  ;  and  accordingly,  as  narrated  by 
Abercromby,    attended    St    Lewis,    King   of   France,   to    the  seventh

Crusade  in  1 248,  becoming,  at  the  death  of  his  brother-in-law,  the  Earl 
of  Dunbar,  commander  of  the  Scots  contingent.  In  1255  he  was  one 
of  the  council  of  Alexander  III.,  then  under  age,  and  also  one  of  the 
Regents  of  the  kingdom.  Alexander  the  Stewart,  together  with  Pat- 
rick Earl  of  March,  Malise  Earl  of  Stratherne,  Niel  Earl  of  Carrick, 
Robert  de  Brus,  and  Alan  Dureward  (a  descendant  of  Thomas  de 
Londoniis),  opposed  the  schemes  of  the  Cumyns,  Robert  de  Ros, 
and  John  de  Baliol.  When  Alexander  III.,  King  of  Scotland, 
went  to  England  with  his  queen,  Margaret,  daughter  of  Henry  III. 
of  England,  he  stipulated  that,  if  he  should  die  there,  their  child, 
then  expected,  should  be  intrusted  to  the  care  of  Alexander  the 
Stewart. 

At  the  defeat  of  the  Norwegians  at  Largs  in  1263,  the  High 
Steward  commanded  the  right  wing  of  the  Scots,  and  having  routed 
those  opposed  to  him,  he  wheeled  his  division,  in  military  phrase,  to 
the  left  about,  and  attacked  the  enemy  in  reverse,  disengaging  the 
sovereign,  who  was  surrounded.  Boece  records  of  Alexander  at  Largs, 
"  Incontinent,  Alexander  Stewart  of  Paisley  came  with  a  bachement  of 
fresche  men  to  the  Middleward,  quhair  King  Alexander  was  fechtand 
against  King  Acho  with  uncertain  victory,  and  the  Danes  seand  this 
Alexander  cum,  gaif  bakkis."  The  Stewart  was  ordered  to  pursue  the 
enemy  to  the  Hebrides,  which  he  re-annexed  to  the  Crown.  He  then, 
according  to  some  accounts,  invaded  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  compelled 
Magnus,  son  of  Olave,  to  come  to  Dumfries  to  do  homage  to 
King  Alexander,  and  to  become  bound  to  furnish  five  gallies  of 
twenty-four  oars,  and  five  of  twelve  oars,  for  the  service  of  the  Scottish 
king. 

On  the  30th  November  1263,  Alexander  the  Stewart  got  from 
King  Alexander  a  charter  of  the  Barony  of  Garlies,  in  the  Stewartry  of 
Kirkcudbright,  which  was  then  included  in  Dumfriesshire,  and  he  after- 
wards conferred  this  barony  on  Sir  John  Stewart  de  Bonkyl,  his  second 
son.     Alexander's  seal,  appended  to  a  charter  by  him  of  lands  and

is,  says  Laing,  "  unfortunately  but 
the  fragment  of  a  remarkably  fine 
seal.  The  design,  admirably  ex- 
ecuted, is  a  knight  on  horseback  at 
full  speed,  armed  with  a  lance 
couched  in  his  right  hand,  and  on 
his  left  arm  a  shield  bearing  the  fess 
chequd,  which  seems  to  be  repeated 
on  the  breast  leather  of  the  horse. 
Only  the  following  letters  of  the 
inscription  remain  .  .  .  .  '  nescalli 
RE '  .  .  ."  The  counter-seal  bore 
"  a  fess  cheque.  All  that  remains  of  the  inscription  are  the  letters 
'  XANDRi  FiLii ' ;  it  is  most  likely  the  inscriptions  on  both  seals  were  the 
same,  and  have  been  'sigillum  alexandri  filii  walteri  senescalei 

REGIS  SCOCIE.'  " 

At  Roxburgh,  on  the  25th  July  1281,  on  the  final  agreement  as  to 
the  terms  of  the  matrimonial  contract  between  Margaret,  daughter  of 
Alexander  III.,  and  Eric  King  of  Norway,  Alexander  the  Stewart  was 
one  of  the  great  nobles  who  became  bound  for  the  fulfilment  of  the 
articles  agreed  upon  by  the  King  of  Scotland.  He  gave  many  charters, 
chiefly  confirming  those  of  his  predecessors.  In  particular,  in  1266,  in 
presence  of  King  Alexander  and  many  noble  witnesses,  he  gave  a  new 
grant  to  the  abbot  and  monks  of  Melros,  ratifying  to  them  the  lands 
of  which  they  were  already  possessed,  and  granting  them  many  excep- 
tions and  privileges.  In  this  charter  he  is  designed  "  Alexander 
Senescallus  Scotiae,  filius  Walteri  Senescalli."  It  is  recorded  in  the 
Chartulary  of  Paisley  that  he  made  a  pilgrimage  to  the  shrine  of  his 
patron  saint,  Saint  James,  at  Compostella  in  Spain,  the  abbot  and  monks 
of  Paisley  assembling  with  great  pomp  to  give  him  their  blessing  on  his 
departure.    Alexander  married  Jean,  daughter  and  heiress  of  James,  son

of  Angus  M'Rorie  or  M'Roderick,  Lord  of  Bute,  "of  his  own  family," 
a  relationship  to  which  the  attention  of  the  reader  has  been  above  drawn. 
The  M'Rories  were  descended  from  Roderick,  son  of  Somerled,  Lord  of 
the  Isles.     He  died  in  1283,  and  was  buried  at  Paisley,  leaving  issue — 

1.  James,  his  successor. 

2.  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Bonkyl,  ancestor  of  the  Stewarts  of 
Angus,  Galloway,  Blantyre,  Atholl,  Lorn,  Appin,  Buchan,  and  others. 

3.  Elizabeth,  married  to  Sir  William  de  Douglas,  Lord  of  Lugton, 
ancestor  of  the  Earls  of  Morton.  Sir  William  was  uncle  of  the  good 
Sir  James. 

Before  tracing  the  descent  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin  from  Sir  John  Stewart  de  Bonkyl, 
a  short  sketch  of  the  history  of  the  main  line  of  the  House  to  the  accession  of  Robert 
Stewart  to  the  throne  of  Scotland  in  137 1,  will  be  given.  Less  than  a  hundred  years 
afterwards  one  of  the  descendants  of  this  main  line,  Margaret,  daughter  of  the  Duke  of 
Albany,  was  grandmother  of  Dugall,  first  of  Appin,  by  her  marriage  with  Robert  Stewart, 
Lord  of  Lorn. 

James,  the  eldest  son  of  Alexander  Stewart  of  Dundonald,  was  bom  in  1243,  and 
succeeded  his  father  in  1283.  He  was  one  of  the  six  Regents  of  Scotland  during  Queen 
Margaret's  absence  after  the  death  of  her  grandfather  Alexander  IH. ;  the  others  being 
Duncan,  Earl  of  Fife ;  Alexander  Comyn,  Earl  of  Buchan,  Constable  and  Justiciary  of 
Scotland  ;  Fraser,  Bishop  of  St  Andrews  ;  Wishart,  Bishop  of  Glasgow;  and  John  Comyn, 
Lord  of  Badenoch.  In  that  capacity  he  was  addressed,  on  1 4th  October  1 2  86,  by  the  Abbot 
of  Aberbrothoc,  respecting  property  in  that  abbacy,  and  on  the  nth  November  of  the  same 
year,  he  subscribed  a  remonstrance  with  the  King  of  England,  on  the  harsh  conduct  of  the 
King's  Escheator  on  the  north  of  the  Trent.  His  name  also  appears  very  frequently  in  the 
public  documents  of  the  period,  still  preserved  in  the  Register  House  in  Edinburgh,  autho- 
rising the  payment  of  the  customary  fees  to  various  knights,  and  in  all  these  he  gives  the 
confirmatory  signature  at  the  end.  His  name  appears,  on  20th  September  1286,  as  the 
signatory  of  a  bond  between  certain  nobles  of  Scotland  and  England  for  mutual  defence, 
including  Patrick,  Seventh  Earl  of  Dunbar,  and  his  sons  Patrick,  John,  and  Alexander  ; 
Walter,  Earl  of  Menteith ;  Robert  de  Brus,  Lord  of  Annandale,  and  Robert  and  Richard 
his  sons ;  James,  Seneschal  of  Scodand,  and  his  brother  John.  The  Chamberlain  Rolls 
show  that  he  was  Vicecomes  de  Air  before  1289.  In  that  year  the  management  of  the  king- 
dom was  entrusted  to  him,  while  his  colleagues  went  to  England  to  treat  with  Edward  I. 
and  the  ambassadors  of  the  King  of  Nor\vay,  about  the  affairs  of  the  young  Queen  of 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  39 

Scotland  In  1294  he  granted  to  the  Monastery  of  Paisley  the  privilege  of  a  herring- 
fishing  in  the  Clyde.  In  1296  he  signed  the  Ragman  Roll,  a  document  deriving  its  name 
from  Ragimunde,  a  papal  legate  in  Scotland,  which  contains  the  instruments  of  homage 
and  fealty  to  Edward  I.,  sworn  to  by  the  nobility  and  clergy  of  Scotland  ;  but  in  the  year 
following,  he  and  his  brother  John  associated  themselves  with  Wallace  for  the  defence  of 
the  kingdom.  The  dissensions  of  the  party,  however,  induced  James,  Sir  Alexander  de 
Lindsay  of  Crawford,  and  Robert  de  Brus,  to  submit  to  Edward  I.  at  Ayr,  James,  never- 
theless, sending  his  Brandanes,  under  his  brother  John's  command,  to  the  battle  of 
Falkirk,  on  22d  July  1289.     Winton  writes — 

"  Thare  Ihon  Stewart  a'  pon  fute, 
Wyth  hym  the  Brandanes  thare  of  Bute." 

And  Holinshed— "  There  were  slain  Sir  John  Stewart  with  his  Brandanes,  for  so  they 
name  them  that  are  taken  to  warre  furth  of  the  Stewartes  lands." 

In  1307  the  English  burned  a  part  of  the  monastery  of  Paisley.  To  the  perpetration 
of  this  sacrilegious  act  against  the  peculiar  religious  foundation  of  the  Stewarts,  they  were 
doubtless  provoked  by  the  prominent  and  heroic  part  taken  by  Sir  John  Stewart  of 
Bonkill,  and  by  a  feeling  of  revenge  against  James,  the  High  Steward,  who,  after  he  had 
for  a  time  yielded  a  compulsory  obedience  to  Edward  I.,  latterly  became  one  of  the 
most  zealous  and  powerful  supporters  of  Bruce  in  his  protracted  struggle  for  national 
independence. 

James  appears  to  have  frequently,  if  not  principally,  resided  at  Renfrew  Castle,  which 
probably  had  been  originally  an  old  dwelling  of  the  Kings  of  Scotland.  It  stood  on  a 
rising  ground  between  the  Cross  and  the  Ferry  in  the  King's  Inch.  "Here,"  says 
Crawford,  "  the  Lord  High  Stewart  of  Scotland  had  a  castle,  the  chief  manour  of  this  fair 
barony ;  for  this  I  have  seen  a  charter  granted  by  James,  High  Stewart  of  Scotland 
(grandfather  to  King  Robert  II.),  to  Stephen,  ancestor  of  the  family  of  Hall  of  Fulbar, 
the  charter  being  given  '  apud  manerium  nostrum  de  Renfrew.'  This  castle,"  continues 
Crawford,  "was  situate  upon  a  pretty,  rising  ground,  called  Castlehill,  upon  the  brink  of 
the  river  of  Clyde  ;  from  whence  there  has  been  a  very  agreeable  prospect  of  the  country, 
many  miles  distant  every  way,  and  surrounded  with  a  large  and  deep  fossie."  Ramsay  tells 
us  that  the  castle  continued  to  be  one  of  the  principal  residences  of  the  Stewarts  as  long 
as  they  continued  in  the  relation  of  subjects.  Even  after  Robert  II.  ascended  the  throne, 
he  occasionally  resided  there,  as  some  of  his  charters  show.  It  would  also  appear  that 
James  IV.  visited  Renfrew  Casde,  for  a  deed  by  him  bears  to  have  been  executed  there. 

The  seal  of  James,  fifth  High  Steward,  appended  to  a  remittance  in  favour  of  the 
abbey  of  Melros  of  ten  shillings  from  lands  in  the  barony  of  Inverwick,  is  "  but  a  mere 
fragment.     The  design  is  similar  to  the  seal  of  his  father,  and  it  has  evidently  been  a  well

executed  seal.  The  inscription  is  lost,  except  the  letters  i  se  ."  The  counterseal  bears 
"  a  fess  cheque.  The  shield,  of  an  elegant  form,  has  been  surrounded  with  beautiful 
tracery.  The  inscription  is  lost  except  the  letters  esca,  but  was  probably  the  same  as 
that  on  the  seal  of  his  father,  except  the  difference  of  names." 

He  died  on  i6th  July  1309,  and  was  buried  among  his  ancestors  in  the  abbey  of 
Paisley,  to  which  he  had  confirmed,  in  1294,  all  previous  donations  by  his  predecessors. 
He  married  Cecilia,  daughter  of  Patrick,  ninth  Earl  of  Dunbar,  and  had  issue — 

1.  Andrew,  who  predeceased  his  father. 

2.  Walter,  his  successor. 

3.  John,  killed  at  the  battle  of  Dundalk,  5th  October  131S. 

4.  Sir  James,  of  Durrisdeer. 

Also  a  daughter,  Egidia,  married  to  Sir  Alexander  de  Meyners  or  Menzies.  They 
got  a  charier  from  Robert  I.  of  the  lands  of  Durrisdeer,  afterwards  resigned  to  her  brother 
James. 

Walter,  who  succeeded  his  father,  was  bom  in  1293.  The  first  mention  of  him  in 
history  is  when  the  Scottish  army  was  assembled  at  Torwood,  the  day  before  the  battle  of 
Bannockburn,  on  25th  June  1314,  when  Walter  brought  up  a  large  body  of  men  from  his 
extensive  territories  in  Ayrshire,  Renfrewshire,  and  Bute.     Barbour  says — 

"  Walter,  Stewart  of  Scotland,  syne, 
That  then  was  but  a  beardless  hyne. 
Came  with  a  rout  of  noble  men, 
That  might  by  countenance  be  ken." 

In  the  marshalling  of  the  Scottish  army,  the  command  of  the  first  division  was  given 
to  Thomas  Randolph,  Earl  of  Murray ;  that  of  the  second  to  Edward  Bruce,  the  king's 
brother  ;  that  of  the  third  to  Walter,  the  young  Stewart,  though  then  only  twenty-one  years 
of  age,  and  to  his  kinsman,  Sir  James  Douglas ;  the  king  in  person  commanding  the 
fourth  division,  which  was  in  reserve. 

"  And  syne  the  third  battle  they  gave 
To  Walter  Stewart  for  to  lead. 
And  to  Douglas  doughty  of  deed. 
They  were  cousins  in  near  degree. — Barbour. 

Young  Walter  Stewart  was  knighted  after  the  battle, 

"  The  king  maid  Walter  Stewart  knycht, 
And  James  of  Dowglas,  that  wes  wycht," 

says  Barbour.  He  was  subsequently  sent  to  receive,  on  the  borders  of  England,  Elizabeth, 
wife  of  King  Robert,  and  their  daughter,  Marjory,  to  whom  Walter  was  married  the  next 
year,  1315.  In  13 16,  when  King  Robert  went  over  to  Ireland  to  aid  his  brother  Edward, 
he  appointed  Sir  Walter  Stewart  and  Sir  James  Douglas  governors  of  Scotland  during  his

absence.  On  Shrove  Tuesday  of  that  year,  tradition  says,  the  Lady  Marjory  was  unfor- 
tunately thrown  from  her  horse  when  returning  from  Paisley  to  Renfrew  Castle,  and  her 
unborn  son,  afterwards  Robert  IL,  is  said  to  have  been  extracted  by  the  Cassarian  opera- 
tion, in  the  process  of  which  he  got  a  cut  in  the  eye,  which  gave  him  afterwards  the  name 
of  King  "  Blear-eye."  Fordun  says  Robert  was  born  in  the  natural  course,  and  that  Mar- 
jory died  two  days  after  his  birth.  Dr  Lees  relates  that  a  stone  pillar  marked  the  spot 
where  Marjory  fell  from  her  horse,  but  that,  when  last  seen,  it  formed  a  lintel  in  a  farm- 
house, and  that  the  stones  of  the  pedestal  had  been  taken  for  repairing  stone  walls.  In 
Gordon's  Monasticon,  it  is  stated  that  the  death  of  Marjory  Bruce  was  occasioned  by  a 
fall  from  her  horse,  in  March  131 6,  while  hunting  at  the  Knock,  between  Paisley  and  the 
castle  of  Renfrew,  the  principal  seat  of  her  husband,  Walter,  the  Great  Steward  of  Scot- 
land, and  that  Robert  IL  "  was  cuttit  out  of  his  mother's  womb  by  Sir  John  Forrester  of 
Elliestoun.'' 

For  the  welfare  of  his  wife's  soul,  Walter  gave,  in  1318,  the  patronage  of  the  church 
at  Largs,  with  the  tithes  thereto  belonging,  to  the  monks  of  Paisley.  He  also  granted 
to  the  monks  of  Dryburgh  the  patronage  of  the  church  of  Maxton,  in  Roxburghshire, 
and  subsequently  the  church  itself,  with  the  glebe,  to  which  he  added  four  acres  in 
Lonecrofts. 

At  a  convention  of  the  Scots  nobles,  held  at  Ayr  on  the  26th  April  1313,  the  succes- 
sion to  the  Crown,  in  the  event  of  Robert  I.  dying  without  male  issue,  was  settled  on  Edward 
Bruce ;  but,  after  the  death  of  the  latter  at  the  battle  of  Dundalk  in  13 18,  another  parlia- 
ment met  at  Scone  on  the  3d  December  in  that  year,  to  make  a  new  settlement.  It  was 
there  enacted  that  Robert,  the  son  of  Walter  Stewart  and  Marjory  Bruce,  then  called  John, 
should,  failing  issue  of  Robert  I.,  succeed  to  the  throne.  Walter  got  by  his  marriage,  in 
addition  to  his  great  patrimonial  possessions,  the  lands  of  Bathgate,  Rathoe,  Riccardtoun, 
Bams,  Brome,  Bonnington,  Kinalach,  Gallowhill,  Wermes,  Emygaith,  and  the  rents  of  the 
Carse  of  Stirling.  About  1320,  he  also  got  grants  of  the  lands  of  Nisbet,  Langnewton, 
Maxtoun,  and  Cavertoun,  forfeited  by  Sir  John  de  Soulis;  and  Eckford,  Kelly,  and 
Methven,  forfeited  by  Sir  Roger  Moubray. 

Sir  Walter  Stewart  was  made  governor  of  Berwick — an  appointment  which  he  retained 
till  his  death — after  it  was  taken  by  the  Scots  in  1318  ;  and  he  distinguished  himself  by 
the  signal  bravery  with  which,  in  the  following  year,  he  successfully  defended  the  town 
with  his  own  kindred  and  vassals  against  a  large  English  army,  led  by  Edward  II.  in  per- 
son, a  brilliant  sally  made  by  Walter  leading  to  the  final  raising  of  the  siege.  In  1320,  he 
appears  as  a  signatory  of  the  celebrated  letter  to  the  Pope  from  the  Scottish  barons, 
assembled  at  Arbroath.  Laing  says  that  "no  seal  of  Walter  has  yet  been  met  with.  There 
was  one  appended  to  the  letter  of  the  Scottish  barons  to  the  Pope,  a.d.  1320,  but  it  has 
been  for  a  long  time  lost  from  that  instrument.  Could  it  be  here  inserted,  it  would  present

(in  connection  with  the  great  seals  after  their  accession  to  the  throne)  an  unbroken  succes- 
sion of  this  great  family  for  nearly  five  centuries." 

In  1322,  in  an  enterprise  to  seize  Edward  11.  at  Byland  Abbey,  near  Melton  in  York- 
shire, Sir  Walter,  with  Douglas  and  Randolph  at  the  head  of  five  hundred  horsemen,  pur- 
sued the  English  king  to  the  gates  of  York,  and,  in  the  spirit  of  chivalry,  remained 
there  till  evening,  waiting  for  the  enemy  to  come  forth  and  give  battle. 

"  Stewart  Waltre,  that  gret  bounte 
Set  ay  on  hey  chewalry

And  thar  sum  of  thair  men  gan  sla 
And  abade  thar  quhill  ner  the  nycht 
To  see  gif  ony  wald  ische  to  iychi."— Barbour. 

Walter  died  on  the  9th  of  April  1326  ; 

"  As  gude  Crystyn  the  gat  he  gan." 
Crawford  says  "at  Bathcate  in  1328," — Bathgate  Castle,  curiously  situated  in  the  midst 
of  a  bog,  being  one  of  his  chief  residences — and  was  solemnly  interred  at  Paisley. 

"  When  long  time  they  their  Dale  had  made. 
The  Corps  to  Paisley  have  they  had. 
And  there  with  great  solemnity 
And  with  great  Dule,  eirded  was  he." — Barbour. 

Lord  Hailes  remarks,  "  Had  he  lived,  he  might  have  equalled  Randolph  and  Douglas, 
but  his  course  of  glory  was  short." 

Walter  is  said  by  Simson,  and  by  Sir  Robert  Douglas,  to  have  been  three  times  mar- 
ried. First,  to  Alice,  daughter  of  Sir  John  Erskine,  of  Erskine,  by  whom  he  had  a 
daughter,  Jean,  who  was  the  second  wife  of  Hugh,  fifth  Earl  of  Rossj  secondly,  to 
Marjory  Bruce,  mother  of  Robert  II. ;  and,  thirdly,  to  Isabel,  sister  to  the  gallant  Sir 
John  Grahame,  of  Abercom,  by  whom  he  is  said  to  have  had  a  son,  Sir  John  Stewart,  of 
Railstoun.  This  Sir  John  Stewart  had  a  son,  who  died  without  issue,  and  a  daughter,  who 
was  married  to  Sir  William  Graham,  of  Kincardine,  by  whom  she  was  mother  of  Patrick 
Graham,  afterwards  Earl  of  Stratherne.  Walter,  the  High  Steward,  had  also,  by  Isabel 
Grahame,  a  daughter,  Egidia,  who  was  married— first,  by  Papal  dispensation,  dated  at 
Avignon,  nth  April  1346,  to  her  cousin,  Sir  James  Lindsay,  of  Crawford;  secondly,  to 
Sir  Hew  Eglintoun,  of  Eglintoun  and  Ardrossan  ;  and,  thirdly,  to  Sir  James  Douglas,  of 
Dalkeith,  ancestor  of  the  Earls  of  Morton,  and  had  issue  by  all  three.  Her  daughter,  by 
Sir  Hew  Eglintoun,  carried  the  succession  to  the  lordships  of  Eglinton  and  Ardrossan  to 
her  husband.  Sir  John  Montgomerie,  of  Eaglesham,  the  predecessor  of  the  Earls  of 
Eglinton. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  43 

Robert,  High  Steward  of  Scotland,  bom  13 16,  was  declared  heir-presumptive  to  the 
throne  in  13 18,  but  the  birth  of  a  son  to  King  David  Bruce  in  1326  interrupted  his  pro- 
spects for  a  time.  He  had  inherited  from  his  grandfather  large  estates  in  Kintyre.  He 
succeeded  his  father,  Walter,  when  he  was  ten  years  old ;  and  when  only  seventeen, 
fought  at  the  battle  of  Halidonhill  on  13th  July  1333.  The  result  of  that  disastrous  day 
was  to  give  possession  of  nearly  the  whole  of  the  kingdom  to  Balliol,  who  declared  all 
Robert's  estates  forfeited,  and  conferred  them  in  the  following  year  upon  David  de  Strath- 
bogie,  twelfth  Earl  of  AthoU,  nephew  of  John  Cumyn,  of  Badenoch ;  and  it  was  at  this 
time,  as  has  been  before  mentioned,  that  William  Fitz-Alan,  Earl  of  Arundel,  laid  claim 
to  the  Stewardship,  and  sold  it  to  Edward  III.  for  1000  merks.  Robert,  once  the  most 
opulent  noble  in  Scotland,  had  now  nothing  left  but  his  valour  and  enterprise.  He  lay 
concealed  in  Bute  for  some  months,  but,  gradually  collecting  a  body  of  men,  he  recaptured 
his  own  castle  of  Dunoon  ;  and  his  cousin,  Colin  Campbell,  son  of  Sir  Neil  Campbell,  of 
Lochow,  by  Mary,  sister  of  King  Robert  Bruce,  bringing  some  Highlandmen  to  his  assis- 
tance, he  took  possession  of  his  paternal  estates  in  Renfrewshire,  and  was  the  first  to  raise 
in  the  field  the  standard  of  Scottish  independence,  after  the  overwhelming  defeat  of  Hali- 
donhill. Fordun  says  he  was  there  joined  by  William  Carnithers  and  a  band  of  "  honest 
men  and  proved  Scotsmen  "  from  Annandale. 

Fordun  describes  Robert  in  Latin,  of  which  the  following  may  be  taken  as  a  transla- 
tion : — "  He  was  a  comely  youth,  tall  and  robust,  modest,  liberal,  gay,  and  courteous  ; 
and  for  the  sweetness  of  his  disposition,  beloved  by  all  true  hearted  Scotsmen." 

In  the  History  of  Dumbartonshire  we  find  the  following  account  of  the  events  of 
i333"4 : — "  In  the  exercise  of  that  power  with  which  he  considered  himself  invested, 
Balliol  conferred  upon  the  Earl  of  Atholl  the  extensive  possessions  of  Robert  the  Stewart 
of  Scotland,  grandson  of  Robert  Bruce.  This  young  baron,  stript  of  his  patrimony,  and 
closely  pursued  by  the  enemies  of  his  house,  lay  concealed  on  his  paternal  estate  (the 
island  of  Bute)  for  about  a  twelvemonth,  after  the  defeat  of  Halidon  Hill.  With  a  skill 
and  determination  far  beyond  his  years  (he  was  only  18),  he  organised  a  plan  for  escaping 
to  the  castle  of  Dumbarton.  Confiding  his  scheme  to  two  faithful  vassals  of  the  family 
named  Gibson  and  Heriot,  they  brought  a  boat  to  a  convenient  spot  on  the  shore  late  in 
the  evening,  and  accompanied  by  a  page  and  two  staunch  friends,  the  Stewart  was  con- 
veyed to  a  point  on  the  Cowall  shore,  where  horses  were  in  readiness  to  convey  the  party 
to  Dumbarton.  .  .  .  Robert  the  Stewart  did  not  long  remain  inactive  in  the  district  where 
he  now  found  himself;  gathering  together  such  friends  of  his  house  as  were  willing  to 
risk  their  lives  in  his  cause,  he,  along  with  Sir  Colin  Campbell  of  Lochow,  attacked  and 
destroyed  the  castle  of  Dunoon,  and  put  many  of  its  defenders  to  the  sword.  The  news 
of  this  success  was  not  long  in  reaching  his  retainers  in  Bute,  who,  mustering  in  great 
force,  captured  de  Lyle,  the  English  Governor,  and  put  him  to  death.     Bearing  his  head

in  savage  triumph  along  with  them,  the  Stewart's  vassals,  or,  as  Wynton  calls  them,  the 
Brandanes  of  Bute,  soon  after  left  the  island  and  joined  their  master  in  the  neighbourhood 
of  Dumbarton.  In  the  same  year,  1334,  an  assembly  of  the  Scottish  nobles  was  held,  in 
which  the  young  Stewart  and  the  Earl  of  Moray  were  elected  joint  regents  on  behalf  of 
David,  then  an  exile  in  France." 

In  1338  the  Earl  of  Moray  being  prisoner  in  England,  and  Sir  John  Moray  of 
Bothwell  dead,  Robert  Stewart  was  acknowledged  sole  Regent,  and  gradually  expelled  the 
English  from  Edinburgh,  and  from  all  the  towns  north  of  the  Forth. 

In  1341  King  David  II.  returned  to  Scotland,  and  assumed  the  government.  At 
the  battle  of  Durham,  in  1346,  Robert  Stewart  and  Patrick,  ninth  Earl  of  Dunbar  and 
March,  commanded  the  left  wing,  and  brought  off  the  remains  of  the  Scots  army  from  that 
illstarred  field.  Robert  was  elected  Regent  of  the  kingdom  during  King  David's  eleven 
years'  imprisonment  in  England,  under  the  title  of  "  Robertus  Senescallus  Scotiae  locum 
tenens  Serenissimi  Principis  David." 

When  David  was  ransomed  in  1357,  it  was  agreed  that  twenty  young  Scots  nobles 
should  be  given  as  hostages,  and  amongst  these  was  the  eldest  son  of  the  Stewart.  In 
1359  the  king  conferred  upon  Robert  the  Earldom  of  Strathern. 

King  David  II.  died  on  the  22d  February  137 1,  and  on  the  26th  March  1371  his 
nephew,  Robert  Stewart,  was  crowned  King  of  Scotland  at  Scone.  At  his  coronation  a 
solemn  Act  was  passed,  reciting  the  Act  passed  at  Scone  in  the  time  of  Robert  I.,  and 
fixing  the  succession  on  his  eldest  son,  John  "  Comes  de  Carrick  et  Senescallus  Scotiae." 
On  succeeding  to  the  throne  he  changed  his  name  to  Robert,  a  name  beloved  by  the  Scots, 
who  considered  John,  from  the  e.xamples  of  King  John  of  England  and  John  Baliol,  a 
name  of  ill  omen  for  a  king. 

The  narrative  will  now  return  to  Sir  John  Stewart  de  Bonkyl,  second  son  of  Alex- 
ander, High  Steward  of  Scotland,  and  ancestor  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


SIR  JOHN  STEWART,  who  received  from  his  father  the  barony 
of  GarKes,  but  who  was  commonly  designed  of  Bonkyl,  in  Ber- 
wickshire, is  thus  described  in  Nisbet's  Heraldry:  "  Sir  John  Stewart 
of  Bonkyl,  second  son  of  Alexander,  High  Steward  of  Scotland,  born  in 
the  year  1246.  He  married  Margaret,  daughter  of  Sir  Alexander 
Bonkyl  of  that  Ilk.  She  bore  him  several  sons,  heads  of  great  families 
of  the  name  of  Stewart,  which  families  were  known  by  the  fess  chequd, 
and  bend  and  buckles,  the  figures  which  Sir  John  carried  in  right  of  his 
wife ;  viz.,  or,  a  fess  cheque,  surmounted  of  a  bend,  gules,  charged 
with  three  buckles  of  the  first  for  Bonkyl."  A  facsimile  of  the  coat  of 
arms  of  "  Stewart  of  Bonkylle  "  taken  from  the  ancient  heraldic  manu- 
script emblazoned  by  Sir  David  Lyndsay  of  the  Mount,  Lyon  King  at 
Arms  in  the  reign  of  James  V.,  a.d.  T542,  is  given  upon  the  preceding 
page.  Holinshed  writes  :  "  The  said  Alexander  Stewart,  son  of  Alan, 
had  divers  sons  ;  one  of  whom,  John,  married  the  heiress  of  Bonkyl,  a 
virgine  of  great  beauties."  Alexander  de  Bonekil  is  mentioned,  on 
28th  November  1292,  in  the  list  of  exemptions  from  Common  Sum- 
mons to  Common  Pleas,  in  the  County  of  Northumberland  and  Liberty 
of  Tynedale,  together  with  the  King  of  Scotland,  the  Abbot  of  Kelso, 
Patrick  Earl  of  Dunbar  and  March,  and  Thomas  of  Clerehill. 

Sir  John  Stewart's  name  appears  in  the  bond,  previously  quoted  at 
page  38,  wherein  the  Earls  of  Gloucester  and  Ulster,  and  other 
nobles,  James  "  Senescallus  Scotise,"  and  John,  his  brother,  agree  to 
stand  by  each  other  in  all  questions,  saving  their  allegiance  to  their 
respective  sovereigns.  This  contract  is  dated  at  Turnberry  in  Carrick, 
20th  September  1286.  In  the  competition  between  Bruce  and  Baliol 
for  the  Scottish  throne  in   1292,  the  auditors  for  Bruce  were  Walter 


46  THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 

Earl  of  Menteith,  Malcolm  Earl  of  Lennox,  James  the  High  Stewart, 
John  Stewart  his  brother,  Alexander  de  Bonkyl,  Thomas  de  Bonkyl, 
the  Bishops  of  Glasgow  and  Dunkeld,  and  the  Abbots  of  Melros  and 
Jedworth.  Of  the  1600  or  1700  names  in  the  Ragman  Roll,  the  first 
is  that  of  James,  Seneschal  of  Scotland,  and  next  to  it  is  that  of  John 
Stewart  his  brother,  followed  by  those  of  Alexander  Earl  of  Menteth, 
and  Alexander  de  Bonkyl.  The  seals  of  James  the  High  Steward,  and 
of  Sir  John  his  brother,  are  preserved  in  the  Chapter  House,  West- 
minster. That  of  James  is  much  smaller,  and  in  better  preservation, 
than  the  seal  engraved  and  described  at  page  23.  It  bears  "  a  fess 
chequd,  the  shield  surrounded  with  tracery,  secreto 
jACOBi  SENESCALLi  scociE."  That  of  Sir  John  bears 
"  a  fess  cheque  surmounted  with  a  bend,     s'  johannis 

SENESCALL." 

On  Candlemas  day  1296,  John  Stewart  "for  the 
health  of  his  own  soul  and  all  his  ancestors  and  suc- 
cessors, and  for  the  health  of  Margaret  his  wife  and  his  children, 
gives  to  Melroes  and  to  the  canons  thereof"  two  pounds  of  wax  to 
light  at  the  tomb  of  St  Waldare,  to  be  paid  yearly  at  the  fairs  of 
Roxburgh ;  and  among  the  witnesses  is  James,  Seneschal  of  Scotland, 
"  brother  of  the  granter." 

When  King  Edward  I.  of  England  again  invaded  Scotland  in 
1298,  Sir  John  Stewart  joined  Wallace  previous  to  the  battle  of 
Falkirk  on  the  22d  July.  Lord  Hailes  says  of  the  leaders  :  "  They 
whose  names  are  recorded  were  John  Comyn  of  Badenoch,  the 
younger  ;  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Bonkyl,  brother  to  the  Stewart ;  Sir 
John  Graham  of  Abercorn  ;  and  Macduff,  granduncle  of  the  young 
Earl  of  Fife." 

"  Ye  gud  Stewart  yon  till  array  is  gane, 
Ye  field  he  tuk,  as  braw  and  worthy  knycht," 

says  Blind  Harry.     Sir  John  Stewart — who,  in  the  absence  of  his  elder 
brother  James,  was  in  command  of  the  whole  united  body  of  the  vas- 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


sals  and  military  tenants  of  the  House  of  Stewart — contended  with 
Wallace  and  Comyn  for  the  place  of  honour  in  the  line  of  battle  ;  and 
in  the  dissension  which  unhappily  ensued  upon  this  rivalry,  Sir  John 
and  his  division  of  10,000  men  were  overwhelmed  by  the  English. 
Hemmingford  gives  an  account  of  his  death  in  Latin,  which  may  be 
thus  translated  :  "  Among  whom  was  the  brother  of  the  Seneschal  of 
Scotland,  who,  when  giving  commands  to  the  archers  from  the  forest  of 
Selkirk,  was  accidentally  thrown  from  his  horse  and  slain.  The  archers 
stood  around  him  and  were  overpowered,  men  who  were  of  tall  stature 
and  of  elegant  form."  The  monument  to  Sir  John  Stewart  at  Falkirk 
is  a  plain  slab,  with  the  inscription,  "  Here  lies  a  Scottish  hero,  Sir 
John  Stewart,  killed  at  the  battle  of  Falkirk,  22  July  1298,"  with  a  cross 

underneath. 

"  Quhen  Wallace  saw  zis  nobile  worthi  deid. 
Held  up  hys  handys  with  humyll  prayer  prest," 

is  Blind  Harry's  touching  lament  for  his  fall. 

In  an  inquisition  taken  at  Carlisle  by  Edward  I.,  a  jury  de- 
clared that  the  deceased  Alexander  de  Bonkyl  had  possessed  the 
manor  of  Ulnedale,  in  Cumberland,  with  the  pertinents  of  Thomas  de 
Lucy,  and  that  the  said  manor  was  escheated  to  the  King,  as  Margaret, 
daughter  and  heir  of  the  said  Sir  Alexander,  residing  in  Scotland  with 
the  enemies  of  their  sovereign  lord,  Edward,  King  of  England. 

There  are  many  proofs  in  records  that  this  Sir  John  Stewart  mar- 
ried the  daughter  and  heiress  of  Sir  Alexander  of  Bonkyl,  or  Bonckhill, 
as  the  name  was  afterwards  spelled,  and  that  he  was  killed  in  1298; 
but  it  appears  that  his  father  -  in  -  law  did  not  die  till  about  1 300. 
Thus  Sir  John  was  not  universally  styled  de  Bonkyl  by  contemporary 
writers,  but  in  Barbour  and  other  authorities  his  son  Sir  Alexander 
Stewart  was  so  called. 

"  For  off  Bonkle  the  Lord  thar  was, 
Alysander  Stewart  hat  he." — Barbour. 

In  another  inquisition,  taken  at    Ulnedale,  a  jury  declared    that 


48  THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 

Alexander  le  Seneschal  was  seized  as  of  fee  of  the  manor  of  Ulnedale, 
and  that  he  had  departed  from  the  fealty  due  by  him  to  his  sovereign 
Lord  and  King,  then  Edward  II. 

Sir  John  Stewart,  killed  at  Falkirk,  a.d.  1298,  left  by  his  wife  Mar- 
garet a  large  family,  upon  each  and  all  of  whom,  no  doubt  in  recogni- 
tion of  their  father's  distinguished  services,  Robert  the  Bruce  bestowed 
the  most  signal  marks  of  favour,  in  the  grant  of  honours  and  lands. 

I.  Sir  Alexander  Stewart  of  Bonkyl.  We  read  in  the  family  record  of  the  Bruces 
and  the  Comyns  that  "  in  1308,  Sir  Thomas  Randolph,  the  king's  nephew,  and  Alexander 
Stewart  of  Bonkyl,  then  in  the  interest  of  England,  but  afterwards  the  most  trusty  adher- 
ents of  the  Bruce,  were  taken  prisoners  by  Sir  James  Douglas,  who  treated  them  with 
great  kindness,  and  soon  after  made  their  peace  with  the  king."  Sir  Alexander  left  a  son, 
Sir  John  Stewart  of  Bonkyl,  created  by  King  Robert  L,  in  1327,  Earl  of  Angus  on  the 
failure  of  the  lines  of  Comyn  and  Umfraville  ;  and  a  daughter,  Isabel,  who  married,  ist, 
Donald  twelfth  Earl  of  Mar,  and,  2ndly,  after  her  first  husband's  death  at  Dupplin  in 
1332,  her  cousin,  John  Randolph,  third  Earl  of  Moray,  who  fell  at  Durham  in  1346.  Sir 
John  Stewart  is  designed  Earl  of  Angus,  Lord  Bonkyll  and  Abernethy,  in  the  charter  of 
the  lands  of  Blainerne  which  he  inherited  through  his  wife  Margaret,  daughter  of  Sir 
Alexander  Abernethy.  He  died  in  1331,  leaving,  besides  two  daughters,  one  son  Thomas, 
second  Earl  of  Angus,  who,  by  his  wife  Margaret,  daughter  of  Sir  William  Sinclair  of 
Roslin,  had  issue  Thomas,  third  Earl  of  Angus,  who  married  Margaret,  daughter  and 
co-heir  of  Donald  twelfth  Earl  of  Mar,  a  marriage  of  which  there  was  no  issue.  Conse- 
quently, upon  the  death  of  the  third  Earl  in  1377,  the  estate  and  honours  devolved  upon 
the  son  of  his  elder  sister  Margaret,  who  had  married,  first,  Thomas  thirteenth  Earl  of 
Mar  (without  issue),  and,  secondly,  William  first  Earl  of  Douglas,  to  whom  she  was  third 
wife,  and  by  whom  she  had  a  son  George,  who,  as  Earl  William's  second  son,  succeeded 
to  his  mother's  title  as  fourth  Earl  of  Angus,  being  the  first  Earl  of  Angus  of  the  Douglas 
family.  I'he  estates  of  Bonkyl, — now  called  Bonkle,  and  lying  in  the  united  parishes  of 
Reston  and  Bunkle,  near  Dunse — the  Abernethy  estates,  and  others,  passed  with  the  titles 
to  the  Douglasses.  These  honours  were  subsequently  restricted  to  heirs-male,  and  are 
now  vested  in  the  Duke  of  Hamilton,  the  head  of  the  family  of  Douglas,  who,  as  Earl 
of  Angus  and  Lord  Abernethy,  and  representative  in  the  male  line  of  George  fourth  Earl 
of  Angus,  now  quarters  with  his  paternal  coat  the  fesse  chequ^  and  buckles  of  Stewart 
of  Bonkyl.  These  bearings  also  appear  on  the  shield  of  the  Duke  of  Buccleuch,  from 
the  marriage,  about  1565,  of  Sir  Walter  Scott  of  Branxholm  and  Buccleuch  with  Lady 
Margaret  Douglas,  daughter  of  David  seventh  Earl  of  Angus. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


2.  Sir  Alan  Stewart  of  Dreghorn,  in  Ayrshire,  who  got  from  King  Robert  I.  a  charter 
of  the  lands  of  "  Dregerum,  que  fuerunt  Johannis  de  Baliolo,  Willielmi  de  Ferrariis,  et 
Allani  la  Suce,"  which  continued  in  the  possession  of  his  descendants  till  1520.  These 
lands,  as  also  those  of  Perceton  and  Warwickhill,  bestowed  on  Sir  Alan's  younger  brother. 
Sir  James,  formed  part  of  the  great  barony  of  Cunninghame,  which  had  passed,  as  has  been 
above  mentioned,  by  the  marriage  of  the  heiress  of  the  De  Morvilles,  into  the  possession 
of  the  Lords  of  Galloway,  and  again  in  the  same  manner  into  that  of  Roger  de  Quinci, 
Earl  of  Winchester.  Two  of  the  daughters  of  the  latter  marrying,  respectively,  AVilliam  de 
Ferrars,  Earl  of  Derby,  and  Alan  de  la  Zuche,  brought  to  their  husbands  large  possessions 
in  Cunninghame,  which  were  after^vards  forfeited  in  consequence  of  the  adherence  of  their 
possessors  to  the  cause  of  Baliol.  Sir  Alan  Stewart  fell  at  the  battle  of  Halidon  Hill,  in 
1333.  From  him  are  sprung  the  Lords  of  Damley  and  d'Aubigny,  the  Earls  and  Dukes 
of  Lennox,  the  Earls  of  Galloway,  and  their  cadets,  amongst  whom  are  the  Stuarts  of 
Castlemilk.  This  latter  family  resided  at  their  seat  of  Castlemilk,  in  Dumfriesshire,  from 
1387  to  1579,  when  they  sold  that  estate  to  John,  Lord  Maxwell,  removing  to  their  pro- 
perty at  Cassiltoun  in  Lanarkshire,  which  they  named  Castlemilk,  so  as  to  retain  their 
ancient  designation.  Sir  Alan's  great-grandson  married  Marion  Stewart,  heiress  of  Dal- 
swinton,  in  Dumfriesshire,  and  of  Garlies,  now  in  the  Stewartry  of  Kirkcudbright,  but  which 
then  formed  part  of  the  county  of  Dumfries,  and  after  this  marriage  there  descended  from 
the  main  line  of  Garlies  or  Galloway,  the  Lords  of  Blantyre  and  Blessington,  and  the 
Stewarts  of  Barclay,  Physgill,  and  Castle  Stewart. 

Henry,  Lord  Damley,  eldest  surviving  son  of  Matthew,  Earl  of  Lennox,  the  eighth 
in  descent  from  Sir  Alan,  married  Mary  Queen  of  Scotland,  in  July  1565,  and  their  last 
descendant  in  the  male  line,  Prince  Henry  Benedict  Maria  Clement,  Cardinal  York, 
younger  brother  of  Prince  Charles  Edward,  died  at  Rome,  in  June  1807,  in  the  83d  year 
of  his  age.  Charles,  second  surviving  son  of  Matthew,  Earl  of  Lennox,  was  created  Earl 
by  King  James  VI.,  but  the  peerage  eventually  went  into  the  family  of  John,  Lord 
d'Aubigny,  brother  of  Matthew,  whose  son  was  raised  to  the  rank  of  Duke  of  Lennox,  and 
on  the  death  of  the  last  heir-male  of  the  family,  the  honours  of  this  illustrious  house 
reverted  to  King  Charles  IL,  as  nearest  heir-male,  and  His  Majesty  conferred  them  upon 
his  natural  son,  Charles  Lenox,  whose  descendant  is  Duke  of  Richmond,  Lennox,  and 
Gordon.  The  Royal  family  of  Stewart,  the  senior  branch  of  Bonkyl,  and  the  Houses  of 
Damley,  d'Aubigny,  and  Lennox,  being  all  extinct  in  the  male  line,  the  Earl  of 
Galloway  is  now  the  representative,  in  the  male  line  of  descent,  of  the  High  Stewards  of 
Scotland. 

3.  Sir  Walter  Stewart  of  Dalswinton  got  a  charter  of  the  lands  of  Dalswinton 
from  King  Robert  I.,  and  of  the  Barony  of  Garlies  from  his  nephew,  John  Randolph, 
third  Earl  of  Moray.     His  great-granddaughter,  Marion,  was  married,  as  above  mentioned,

THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


in  1396,  to  John,  great-grandson  of  Sir  Alan,  carrying  with  her  as  her  portion,  the  estates 
of  Dalswinton  and  Garlies. 

4.  Sir  James  Stewart  of  Perston  and  Warwickhill  in  Cunninghame,  got  a  charter 
of  these  lands  from  King  Robert  I.  From  Sir  James  are  descended  the  Stewarts,  Earls 
of  Buchan,  Atholl,  and  Traquair,  the  Lords  of  Lorn,  now  represented  by  the  Stewarts  of 
Appin,  the  Stewarts  of  Grandtully,  Rosyth,  Kinnaird,  etc. 

5.  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Daldon  was  one  of  the  principal  persons  who  landed  at 
Carrickfergus,  on  25th  May  13 15,  with  Edward  Bruce,  when,  in  command  of  an  army  of 
6000  men,  he  made  his  brilliant  but  fruitless  attempt  to  aid  the  Irish  of  Ulster  to  throw 
off  the  English  yoke.  "  And  Schyr  Ihone  Stewart  went  alsua,"  says  Barbour.  He  is  also 
mentioned  in  Fordun's  Scotichronicon,  and  was  killed  at  the  battle  of  Halidon  Hill, 
apparently  leaving  no  issue. 

6.  Sir  Robert  Stewart  of  Dalduie  in  Lanarkshire.  He,  too,  accompanied  Edward 
Bruce  to  Ireland,  and  was  at  the  concluding  battle  of  Dundalk,  on  5th  October  1318. 
According  to  Sir  Henry  Steuart,  "  his  grandson,  Sir  Alan  obtained  the  lands  of  Allantoun, 
in  Lanarkshire,  and  from  him  have  sprung  the  Steuarts  of  Allanton  and  their  various 
descendants,  viz.,  those  of  Kirkfield  and  Coltness,  Goodtrees,  Westshield,  Collemie, 
Westbams,  AUanbank,  and  Mitcham,  as  also  the  Steuarts  of  Hartwood,  Carbarns,"  etc. 

7.  Sir  Hugh  Stewart,  who  is  said,  in  Holinshed's  Chronicles,  to  have  accompanied 
Edward  Bruce  to  Ireland,  and  to  have  died  without  issue. 

Sir  John  Stewart  of  Bonkyl  had  also  a  daughter,  Isabel,  married  to  Thomas  Randolph, 
first  Earl  of  Moray,  to  whom  she  brought  the  barony  of  Garlies  as  her  portion.  This 
barony  was  afterwards  transferred  by  John,  Earl  of  Moray,  to  his  uncle.  Sir  Walter  Stewart 
of  Dalswinton. 

Sir  James  Stewart,  fourth  son  of  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Bonkyl,  and 
ancestor  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin,  had  a  charter  from  King  Robert  Bruce 
of  the  lands  of  Peristoun  and  Warwickhill,  in  the  district  of  Cuninghame 
in  Ayrshire.  The  charter  is  to  "  dilecto  et  fideli  Jacobo  Stewart  filio 
quondam  domini  Johannis  Stewart  terrarum  Preston  et  Warwickhill  infra 
baroniam  de  Cunningham."  Sir  James  was  present  at  the  battle  of 
Bannockburn  in  13 14,  on  which  occasion,  says  Sir  D.  Dalrymple,  the 
second  body  of  the  Scots  army  was  commanded  by  the  youthful  Steward 
of  Scotland,  under  the  inspection  of  his  uncle.  Sir  James  Stewart  of 
Rosyth.  It  has,  however,  been  elsewhere  pointed  out  that  Sir  James 
was  not  his  uncle,  but  his  father's  first  cousin.     He  was  killed  at  Hallidon 


Hill  on  19th  July  1333,  with  his  brothers  Sir  Alan  and  Sir  John  Stewart. 
Fordun,  in  recounting  the  most  distinguished  persons  killed  at  this 
battle,  begins  thus,  "  Nomina  nobillum  occisorum  ex  parte  Regis  David 
sunt  hsc ;  tres  incliti  fratres  vizt.  Jacobus  Joannes  et  Alanus  Stewart." 
Winton,  in  his  Chronicle,  mentions,  James,  John,  and  Alan  Stewart  as 
killed  at  the  battle  of  Hallidon  Hill,  and  positively  states  that  they 
were  brothers.  Bellenden,  in  his  translation  of  Boethius,  writes  thus, 
"  In  the  third  battal  was  the  Douglas,  Governor,  having  with  him 
James,  John,  and  Alan  Stewart,"  and  in  his  account  of  the  slain  says, 
"  Thir  are  the  principal  men  that  were  slain,  Archibald  Douglas, 
Governor,  John  Stewart,  James  Stewart,  and  Alan  Stewart." 

Lord  Hailes  in  his  Annals,  in  a  note  at  the  end  of  his  remarks  on 
the  battle  of  Hallidon  Hill,  points  out  that,  "  At  Hallidon  two  Stewarts 
fought,  the  one  Alan  of  Dreghorn,  the  paternal  ancestor  of  Charles  I., 
and  the  other  James,  his  brother,  the  maternal  ancestor  of  Oliver 
Cromwell."  Oliver's  mother  was  descended  from  the  Stewarts  of  Ely. 
Robert  Stewart,  last  Prior  of  Ely,  writing  his  own  genealogy  in  Queen 
Mary's  time,  claimed  to  be  descended  from  Andrew,  son  of  Alexander, 
High  Stewart,  who,  he  says,  fought  a  duel  with  a  Baliol,  and  having 
broken  his  sword,  snatched  up  a  club,  with  which  he  so  beat  his 
antagonist,  that  Baliol  would  have  been  killed  if  help  had  not  been  given 
him.  Hence  these  Stewarts  carry  a  knotty  baton  in  their  arms.  Lord 
Hailes  was  of  opinion  that  they  came  from  Sir  James  Stewart  of 
Perstoun,  through  the  Rosyth  family. 

In  the  disorganisation  which  prevailed  in  Scotland  after  the  defeat 
of  Halidon  Hill,  many  contemporary  records  were  destroyed  or  lost, 
and  the  name  of  Sir  James  Stewart's  wife  has  not  been  preserved.  He 
left  legitimate  issue,  three  sons  and  one  daughter. 

I.  Sir  John  Stewart,  designed  of  Perston  in  a  charter  of  1356. 
He  had  a  charter  in  that  year,  from  King  David  II.,  of  the  barony  of 
Kelly,  in  Forfarshire,  and  a  confirmation  from  King  Robert  III.  of  the 
same  barony  in  1384.      He  also  occurs  as  a  witness  in  a  confirmatory 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


charter  by  King  David  II.  of  lands  to  the  abbey  of  Kilwinning.  He 
left  one  daughter,  married  to  Sir  William  Douglas,  designed  in  1391 
"  Dominus  de  Peirston."  Sir  William  left  three  daughters,  all  great 
heiresses,  the  eldest  being  married  to  Blair  of  Adamton,  the  second  to 
Crawfurd  of  Thirdpart,  and  the  youngest,  whose  portion  consisted  of 
Perceton  and  Warwick  Hill,  to  Robert  Berkeley,  ancestor  of  the  Bar- 
clays, now  baronets  of  Perceton. 

2.  Sir  Alan  Stewart,  of  Ochiltree,  or  Ugiltree,  in  Ayrshire,  who, 
in  a  charter  in  1377  making  over  the  barony  of  Longnewton  to  Sir 
Henry  Douglas,  of  Lugton,  his  relative,  describes  himself  as  "  Alanus 
filius  quondam  Jacobi  Stewart."  He  occurs  again,  together  with  his 
son  John — with  whom  his  line  seems  to  have  ended — in  another  obliga- 
tion to  Sir  Henry  Douglas,  regarding  the  lands  of  Longniddry.  Their 
seals  are  thus  described  by  Laing.  Sir  Alan's  is  "  Couch6  a  fess  chequ6 
surmounted  with  a  bend,  charged  with  three  buckles,  crest  on  a  helmet, 
a  horse's  head  issuing  from  a  coronet.  Supporters,  two  lions  sejant, 
gardant,  coue."  Of  his  son's,  Laing  says,  "  This  a  fine  seal,  in  excellent 
preservation.  The  design  is  precisely  the  same  as  that  on  his  father's 
seal,  with  the  addition  of  a  label  of  three  points  as  a  difference." 

3.  Sir  Robert  Stewart,  of  Schanbothy,  in  the  county  of  Clack- 
mannan, upon  whose  descendants  the  representation  of  the  male  line  of 
Peirstoun  thus  devolved,  and  ancestor  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin. 

Sir  Robert  Stewart,  of  Schanbothy,  designed  "of  Innermeath," 
in  his  brother  Alan's  charter  in  1377,  to  which  he  was  a  witness.  Sir 
Robert  had  a  charter  of  the  lands  of  Schanbothy  from  his  cousin, 
Thomas  de  Moravia,  Lord  of  Bothwell,  which  was  confirmed  by  David 
II.  He  also  had  a  grant,  dated  23d  March  1362,  from  David  II.,  of 
the  lands  of  Motherwell  and  Dalzell,  in  Lanarkshire,  which  had  been 
forfeited  by  Sir  Robert  de  la  Val ;  a  charter  of  Innermeath,  now  Inver- 
may,  in  Perthshire,  in  the  same  year ;  and  also  a  charter  of  half  the 
lands  of  Redcastle,  in  Forfarshire.  The  feudal  or  baronial  residence 
of  Redcastle,  one  of  the  oldest  castellated  ruins  in  Angus,  is  situated 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


at  the  influx  of  the  river  Lunan  into  the  German  Ocean,  on  an 
almost  perpendicular  eminence  on  the  edge  of  the  sea.  It  was  built 
by  William  the  Lion,  and  used  by  him  as  a  hunting  seat,  and  sub- 
sequently became  the  property  of  Walter  de  Berkeley,  Chamberlain  of 
Scotland,  whose  daughter  married  Ingelram  de  Baliol,  Lord  of  Barnard 
Castle,  the  first  of  that  name  in  Scotland.  Redcastle  passed  to  their 
eldest  son,  Henry,  whose  son,  John,  by  his  marriage  with  Devorgilla, 
eldest  daughter  and  co-heiress  of  Allan,  Lord  of  Galloway,  was  John  de 
Balliol,  some  time  king  of  Scotland.  Redcastle  was  for  a  long  time 
possessed  by  the  Stewarts,  Lords  of  Innermeath,  who  also  held  Inver- 
keillor  and  Lunan.  He  had  likewise  charters  of  confirmation  in  1372, 
"  Roberto  Stewart  de  Schanbothy,  militi,"  of  the  lands  of  Gerpets,  Cragy, 
Castletoun,  Hoggestoun,  Wester  Balblair,  &amp;c.  In  1372  Alexander 
Meniers  or  Menzies,  who  had  married  Egidia,  daughter  of  James,  the 
High  Steward,  gave  him  Durrisdeer,  in  Dumfries-shire,  for  which  Sir 
Robert  had  a  charter.  Alexander  Menzies  had  previously  resigned 
these  lands  to  James  Stewart,  his  wife's  brother,  but  James  dying  with- 
out issue,  they  had  reverted  to  him,  and  he  now  conferred  them  on  his 
wife's  cousin.  In  the  parliament  of  Robert  II.,  held  at  Scone  4th  April 
1373,  he  is  designed  "  Robertus  Senescallus  de  Innermeath."  He  had 
also  a  charter  from  Robert  II.,  dated  8th  October  1382,  of  the  lands  of 
Castletoun,  Hogstoun,  Wester  Balblayne,  Morehouse,  and  others  in 
Forfarshire;  and  another,  dated  1386,  "Domino  Roberto  Stewart  de 
Innermeath,"  granting  him  an  annuity  of  twenty  merks  sterling,  out  of 
the  burgh  of  Inverkeithing.  Sir  Robert's  seal  bore  a  fess  chequ^, 
within  a  border  charged  with  buckles  for  Bonkyl,  the  bordure  having, 
no  doubt,  been  assumed  as  a  mark  of  cadency.  The  name  of  his  wife 
is  not  mentioned  by  any  genealogist.  He  died  in  1387,  leaving  two 
legitimate  sons  and  one  daughter. 

1.  Sir  John  Stewart,  ancestor  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin. 

2.  Sir  Robert  Stewart,  who  inherited  Schanbothy  from  his  father. 
He  had,  from   his  brother  John,  a  charter  of  ^20  sterling,  payable 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


yearly,  out  of  the  barony  of  Durrisdeer,  and  a  confirmation  thereof 
by  King  Robert  II.,  under  the  great  seal,  dated  20th  April  1386.  He 
married  Janet,  elder  daughter  and  heiress  or  co-heiress  of  John  de 
Ergadia,  Lord  of  Lorn  and  chief  of  the  family  afterwards  bearing  the 
surname  of  MacDougall.  He  subsequently  surrendered  Lorn  to  his 
elder  brother.  Sir  John  Stewart,  in  exchange  for  Durrisdeer,  by  a 
charter  dated  13th  April  1388.  About  that  year  Sir  Robert,  together 
with  Sir  William,  the  Black  Douglas,  Lord  of  Niddesdale,  invaded 
Ireland  by  way  of  retaliation  upon  England,  took  and  burned  the  town 
of  Carlingford,  and  carried  off  great  booty.  He  appears  in  the  records 
of  the  Tower  of  London  as  having  had  a  safe  conduct  to  proceed  to 
London,  dated  7th  July  1394,  perhaps  on  business  connected  with  a 
treaty  then  under  negotiation  between  Robert  II.  and  England.  He 
was  taken  prisoner  at  Homildon  in  1401,  and  killed  at  the  batde  of 
Shrewsbury  on  21st  July  1403,  where  he  and  other  Scots  nobles  had 
gone  to  assist  Harry  Hotspur  and  Owen  Glendower.  He  was  ancestor 
of  the  Stewarts  of  Rosyth,  in  Fife,  and  Craigiehall,  in  Linlithgowshire, 
who  became  extinct  on  the  death  of  William,  last  of  Rosyth,  without 
issue,  in  1694. 

3.   Katharine,  married  to  John  Bethune,  of  Balfour. 

Sir  John  Stewart  inherited  from  his  father,  as  we  see  from  a 
charter  of  1388,  Innermeath  and  Durrisdeer,  and  subsequently  ex- 
changed Durrisdeer  with  his  younger  brother,  Robert,  for  the  lordship 
of  Lorn.  According  to  Sir  Robert  Douglas,  he  married,  apparently 
about  1386,  Isabel,  the  younger  daughter  of  John  de  Ergadia,  Lord  of 
Lorn.  Skene  calls  her  co-heiress  with  her  sister.  In  the  "  Origines 
Parochiales  Scotise,"  it  is  said,  "Before  the  year  1388,  Janet,  the 
daughter  and  heiress  of  John  of  Lorn,  appears  to  have  carried  the  lands 
of  Lome  to  her  husband,  Sir  Robert  Stewart.  In  1388  the  lands 
of  Lome,  Benechdirloch,  Apthane,  and  Lesmore  were  resigned  by  Sir 
Robert  the  Stewart  and  Janet,  his  wife,  and  were  then  granted  by 
Robert  II.  to  John  the  Stewart,  of  Innermeath."    Sir  John  also  received 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


from  Robert  II.  a  confirmatory  charter  of  the  lands  of  Lome,  including 
Apthane,  resigned  by  his  brother.  He  had  a  charter,  circa  1 390,  from 
Robert,  Earl  of  Fife  and  Monteith,  Duke  of  Albany,  and  Regent  of 
Scotland,  of  the  lands  of  Cullyndrane,  in  the  earldom  and  sheriffdom  of 
Fife,  for  his  good  services,  Sir  John  paying  therefor  three  suits  at  the 
three  chief  courts  held  yearly  at  Cupar,  with  wards  and  releifs  when 
they  shall  happen,  to  be  held  of  the  granter  and  his  heirs  for  ever.  He 
also  occurs  in  a  confirmatory  charter  by  the  Regent,  Robert,  Duke  of 
Albany,  of  the  barony  of  Hawick  to  William  of  Douglas,  of  Drumlan- 
rig,  dated  24th  October  1407.  There  is  also  a  charter  dated  at  Inner- 
meth,  9th  March  14 19,  from  William  Heryss,  lord  of  a  part  of  the 
lands  of  Colcarny,  to  Sir  John  Stewart,  Lord  of  Innermeth,  for  his  good 
and  faithful  counsel  and  assistance  often  rendered  to  the  granter,  of  his 
said  lands  of  Colcarny,  with  their  pertinents,  lying  within  the  sheriffdom 
of  Kynross,  to  be  held  by  him  and  his  heirs  of  the  said  William  and  his 
heirs,  from  the  king,  for  rendering  therefor  yearly  the  usual  services. 

The  family  of  MacDougall  of  Lome,  to  whose  estates  Sir  John 
Stewart  had  thus  succeeded,  is  of  great  antiquity.  In  "  Keltie's  High- 
land Clans "  it  is  said  that  "  Robert  Bruce  determined  to  crush  the 
Macdougalls  of  Lorn  for  their  adherence  to  the  party  of  Comyn,  their 
kinsman,  and  utterly  defeated  them  at  the  pass  of  Awe.  John,  the 
eldest  son,  fled  to  England,  Alister,  the  Lord  of  Lome,  being  allowed 
to  retain  his  possessions  in  vassalage  to  the  King."  A  further  account 
of  the  family  is  given  hereafter. 

Sir  John  Stewart  of  Innermeath  and  Lorn  now  quartered  the  galley 
of  the  Macdougalls  with  his  paternal  coat — giving,  indeed,  to  the  feudal 
ensign  of  this  great  historical  lordship  heraldic  precedence  of  the  fess 
chequ^  of  the  Stewarts  by  assigning  to  it  the  first  and  fourth  quarters 
of  the  shield,  and  dropping  at  the  same  time  the  bordure  charged 
with  the  Bonkyll  buckles,  which  had  been  assumed  by  his  father.  Sir 
Robert,  as  a  mark  of  cadency  at  the  time  when  his  next  elder  brother.

ence.  Sir  John's  son,  Sir  Robert  of  Lorn  and  Innermeath,  on  his 
marriage  with  the  Lady  Margaret  Stewart,  daughter  of  Robert  Duke  of 
Albany  and  Earl  of  Buchan,  charged  the  second  and  third  quarters  of 
his  shield  with  a  garb  in  chief,  the  well  known  feudal  ensign  of  that 
ancient  earldom.  A  facsimile  of  this  coat,  taken  from  the  heraldic 
manuscript  executed  in  1542  by  Sir  David  Lyndsay  of  the  Mount, 
Lyon  King  of  Arms,  and  authenticated  by  the  Scottish  Privy  Coun- 
cil in  1630,  is  given  upon  the  opposite  page.  He  soon,  however, 
restored  the  fess  chequ6  to  the  place  of  honour  upon  the  shield, 
which  is  thus  described  by  Nisbet,  writing  before  Sir  David  Lyndsay's 
MS.  had  become  public.  "  The  antientest  blazon  of  Stewart  of  Inner- 
meath that  I  meet  with  is  quarterly  first  and  fourth,  or,  a  fess  chequ^ 
azure  and  argent,  and  in  chief  a  garb  of  the  second  (some  books  of 
Blazons  in  the  time  of  Queen  Mary,  in  the  place  of  a  garb  have  a  fleur 
de  luce  ;  and  Sir  James  Balfour  in  his  blazons  places  a  buckle  azure, 
which  speaks  better  to  the  descent  from  Stewart  of  Bonkyl),  second 
and  third  a  galley  or  lymphad,  with  flames  of  fire  issuing  out  of  the  top 
of  the  mast,  and  out  of  the  fore  and  hinder  parts,  commonly  called  St 
Anthony's  fire,  for  the  Lordship  of  Lorn." 

In  the  following  generation  we  find  Sir  John  Stewart,  third  of 
Lorn,  as  will  be  seen  from  his  seal  engraved  at  p.  46,  restoring  to 
his  shield  the  Buckle  of  Bonkill  in  addition  to  the  Garb  of  Buchan. 
He  subsequently,  however,  dropped  both  of  these  cognisances,  and 
adopted  as  his  crest  the  unicorn's  head,  the  coat  being  then  that  which 
is  now  borne  by  the  Stewarts  of  Appin,  and  which  is  thus  blazoned  in 
Burke's  General  Armoury  :  "  Stewart  of  Lorn  and  Innermeath :  quar- 
terly, first  and  fourth  or,  a  fess  chequd  azure  and  argent  (in  earlier  times 
differenced  with  a  buckle  gules,  or  a  garb  in  chief)  for  Stewart.  Second 
and  third  a  lymphad,  sometimes  represented  with  St  Anthony's  fire  at 
the  masthead,  for  Lorn.  Crest,  a  unicorn's  head  argent,  horned  or. 
Motto,  Ouhidder  will  zie." 

The  shield  of  Sir  John's  younger  brother  Walter,  who,  as  will  be

THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


seen  hereafter,  became  subsequently  possessed  of  Innermeath,  appears, 
from  the  Heraldic  MSS.  preserved  at  the  Lyon  Office,  to  have  been  at 
first  similar  to  the  one  last  described,  with  the  unimportant  difference 
of  spelling  the  motto  "  Quhadder  Vil  Ze."  At  a  later  period — perhaps 
when  he  became  temporarily  in  nominal  possession  of  a  portion  of 
Lorn — we  find,  from  an  old  book  of  blazons  in  the  Harleian  MSS.  in 
the  British  Museum,  containing  divers  achievements  of  arms  relating  to 
the  Scottish  nation,  that  Walter  replaced  the  galley  in  the  first  and 
fourth  quarters,  and  the  fess  chequti  in  the  second  and  third  quarters  of 
the  shield,  the  crest  being  a  unicorn's  head,  and  the  motto  "  Whither 
will  ye,"  a  blazon  to  which  the  younger  or  Innermeath  branch  of  the 
family  adhered  until  it  became  extinct  in  1625,  with  the  exception  that 
the  unicorn's  head  was  changed,  forty  or  fifty  years  later,  into  that  of  a 
deer,  and  that  two  deer  ("  Fala-deer,"  as  Nisbet  calls  them)  were  added 
as  supporters. 

Nisbet  says :  "  The  unicorn  is  remarkable  for  his  strength,  but 
more  for  his  great  and  haughty  mind,  who  would  die  rather  than  be 
brought  into  subjection,  for  which  see  Job,  chapter  39.  Upon  these 
considerations,  and  others,  the  unicorn  is  adopted  by  our  nation  as  a 
supporter  of  our  sovereign  ensign,  and  has  been  granted  by  our  kings 
to  some  of  their  well-deserving  subjects." 

The  motto,  "  Quhidder  Will  Zie,"  still  borne  by  the  Stewarts  of 
Appin,  is  old  Scots  for  "  Whether  will  ye  ?  "  leaving  peace  or  war  to    , 
the  option  of  the  opponent,  and  indicating  that  the  bearers  of  the  motto    ; 
were  equally  prompt  for  either.      In  the  Scots  of  that  day,  "  qu  "   is 
almost  invariably  found  instead  of  the  letter  "  w  "  at  the  beginning  of  a 
word,  as  in  "  quhair  "  for  "  where."     The  word  "  quhidder  "  itself  is  of   , 
somewhat  rare  occurrence,  but  an  unquestionable  instance  of  its  use  for    i 
whether  is  to  be  found  in  the  poem  entitled  "  The  Pallice  of  Honour,"    \ 
written  by  the  scholarly  Gawain  Douglas,  Bishop  of  Dunkeld,  who  was    ;' 
born  in  1474,  where  the  line  occurs —  j 

"  For  quhidder  I  this  in  saul  or  bodie  saw," 
H 


58  THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 

where  quhidder  is  distinctly  synonymous  with  whether.  A  similar 
instance  will  be  found  of  its  use  with  this  signification  in  the  Decree 
against  Ewen  Cameron  of  Lochiel  by  the  Lords  of  Council  on  1 7th 
February  1 507,  referred  to  hereafter.  "  Z  "  also  is  usually  found  in 
place  of  "  y,"  as  in  "  zie  "  for  "  ye,"  and  in  "  zear  "  for  "  year." 
Sir  John  Stewart  left  issue — 

1.  Robert,  who  succeeded  him. 

2.  Archibald,  mentioned  in  a  charter  of  the  Lordship  of  Lorn,  1452. 

3.  Sir  James,  called  the  Black  Knight  of  Lorn.  Sir  James,  who  is  described  as  "  a 
handsome  graceful  young  man,"  married  in  1439  the  Lady  Joan  Beaufort,  eldest  daughter 
of  John  Marquess  of  Dorset,  granddaughter  of  John  of  Gaunt,  and  widow  of  King  James 
I.  Sir  James  was  at  that  time  closely  allied  with  the  family  of  Douglas,  the  head  of  which 
was  then  Lieutenant  General  of  Scotland,  and  Livingstone  became  alarmed  at  the  pro- 
bable accession  of  power  to  that  great  family.  Seeing  that  Sir  James,  as  husband  of  the 
Queen  mother,  who  was  custodian  of  the  King's  person,  might  insist  upon  a  principal 
share  in  the  education  of  the  youthful  sovereign  as  well  as  in  the  administration  of  the 
government,  Livingstone  threw  Sir  James  and  his  brother  William  into  prison,  at  the 
same  time  confining  the  Lady  Joan  to  her  private  apartments  till  she  signed  a  deed  sur- 
rendering all  control  over  the  person  of  the  young  king,  and  her  own  allowance  as  Queen 
mother.  The  Chronicle  of  Auchinleck  says  that  "  Schir  Alexander  Livingstoune,  the 
Lord  Kalendar,  took  at  the  castle  of  Striveling  Schir  James  Stewart,  the  Lord  of  Lome's 
brother,  and  William  Stewart,  and  put  them  in  pittis  and  bollit  thaim."  After  his  release, 
Sir  James  went  abroad,  and  is  said  to  have  died  off  the  coast  of  Flanders,  leaving 
three  sons. 

(i.)  John,  created  Earl  of  Athole  in  1457.  This  title  had  been  vested  in  the  Crown 
since  the  forfeiture  and  execution  of  Walter  Stewart,  second  son  of  King  Robert 
IIL,  in  1437,  and  it  was  now  bestowed  by  King  James  II.  upon  his  uterine 
brother,  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Balveny.  On  this  peerage  becoming  extinct  in  the 
family  of  Stewart  of  Lorn  by  the  death,  without  male  heirs,  in  1595,  of  John, 
fifth  Earl  of  that  line,  it  was  conferred  by  James  VI.  upon  John  Stewart,  sixth 
Lord  Innermeath,  who  had  married  the  widowed  Countess.  But  the  earldom 
again  reverting  to  the  Crown  on  the  death,  without  issue,  of  James,  second  Earl 
of  Athole  of  the  line  of  Stewart  of  Innermeath,  Charles  I.  granted  it  to  William 
Murray,  second  Earl  of  Tullibardine,  who  had  married  the  Lady  Dorothea 
Stewart,  eldest  daughter  of  John  Stewart,  fifth  Earl  of  Athole,  ordering  that 
"  the  dignity  of  the  Earl  of  Athole,  which  had  so  long  and  so  gloriously  flourished 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  59 

in  the  race  of  the  Stewarts,  related  to  him  in  blood,  should  be  revived  in  the 
person  and  descendants  of  the  lady  who  was  heir  of  line,"  whose  husband  he 
created  Earl  of  Athole.  The  Hurrays  retained  the  motto,  "  Furth  Fortune  and 
fill  the  Fetters,"  which  had  been  adopted  by  Sir  John,  first  Earl  of  the  line  of 
Stewart  of  Lorn.  They  were  the  farewell  words  of  King  James  III.  to  his  uncle 
the  first  Earl,  on  despatching  him,  in  1476,  to  subdue  the  resistance  to  the  royal 
authority  of  the  last  Lord  of  the  Isles,  and  conveyed  the  wish,  "  May  you  be 
fortunate,  and  make  many  prisoners."  Earl  John  adopted  the  words  for  his 
motto,  and  put  it  in  large  letters  on  his  castle  of  Balveny,  taking  also  two 
savages  in  chains  as  his  supporters.  It  is  from  this  marriage  that  the  Duke  of 
Athole  and  the  Earl  of  Dunmore  bear  the  fess  cheque  on  their  arms,  and  a 
savage  as  one  of  their  supporters. 

(2.)  Sir  James  Stewart,  called  "  Hearty  James ; "  created  in  1466  Earl  of  Buchan,  a 
title  which,  since  the  execution,  in  1425,  of  Murdoch,  Duke  of  Albany  and 
Earl  of  Buchan,  had  remained  vested  in  the  Crown.  In  147 1  he  was  made 
High  Chamberlain  of  Scotland,  and  in  1473  was  sent  as  ambassador  to  France, 
on  which  occasion  he  obtained  a  safe  conduct  for  passing  through  England. 
His  death  took  place  before  1500,  and  his  male  line  failed  on  the  death  of  his 
grandson  John,  third  Earl  of  Buchan  of  the  line  of  Stewart  of  Lorn.  The  third 
Earl's  granddaughter,  Christian  Stewart  (daughter  of  John,  Master  of  Buchan, 
who  predeceased  his  father),  succeeding  to  the  title,  carried  it,  by  her  marriage 
in  1569,  to  Robert  Douglas,  second  son  of  Sir  Robert  Douglas  of  Lochleven, 
who  thus  became  fourth  Earl  in  right  of  his  wife. 

The  tide  of  Earl  of  Traquair,  dormant  since  1861,  was  conferred  in  1633  on  Sir  John 
Stuart,  Lord  High  Treasurer  of  Scotland,  fifth  in  descent  from  James  Stewart, 
a  natural  son  of  "  Hearty  James." 

(3.)  Andrew,  Bishop  of  Moray. 

4.  Alexander  Stewart,  ancestor  of  the  Stewarts  of  Grandtully.  Alexander  Stewart 
of  Grandtully  got  a  grant,  on  30th  March  1424,  from  Archibald,  Earl  of  Douglas  and 
Galloway,  "to  and  in  favors  of  Alexander  Stewart,  his  armour-bearer,  son  of  a  noble 
knight.  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Lorn." 

5.  William,  who  shared  his  brother  Sir  James'  imprisonment  by  the  Lord  Kalendar, 
of  whose  issue  there  is  no  record. 

Sir  John  had  also  three  daughters — Christian,  married  to  Sir  James  Dundas  of 
Dundas;  Isabel,  martied  first  to  Sir  William  Oliphant  of  Aberdalgy,  and  secondly 
to  Sir  David  Murray,  designed  of  Gask,  who  founded  and  endowed  the  Collegiate 
Church  of  Tullibardine,  where  he  and  his  wife  were  buried ;  and  Jean,  married  to  Sir 
David  Bruce,  third  Baron  of  Clackmannan. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Robert,  second  Lord  of  Lorn  and  Innermeath,  eldest  son  of  Sir 
John  Stewart,  succeeded  his  father.  He  occurs  in  a  charter  of  Robert 
IL,  A.D.  1439  ;  and  in  another  by  Walter,  Earl  Palatine  of  Stratherne, 
to  David  Murray  of  TuUibardine,  of  the  lands  of  Polgoure,  within  the 
earldom  of  Stratherne  and  sheriffdom  of  Perth.  He  was  one  of  the 
commissioners  appointed  to  treat,  in  142 1,  for  the  return  of  James  L 
from  England,  and  subsequently  proceeded,  in  1429,  to  England  as  one 
of  the  hostages  for  his  ransom.  In  the  second  parliament  called  by  the 
king  after  his  return  to  Edinburgh  in  1425,  Murdoch,  Duke  of  Albany, 
Walter  and  Alexander  Stewart  his  sons,  and  Duncan,  Earl  of  Lennox, 
his  father-in-law,  were  attainted  of  treason,  and  found  guilty  by  a  jury 
composed  of  twenty-one  of  the  most  eminent  subjects  of  the  realm, 
among  whose  names  appears  that  of  "  Robert  Stewart  of  Lorn."  The 
same  day  upon  which  the  sentence  was  pronounced,  the  Duke's  two 
sons,  Walter  and  Alexander,  were  beheaded,  and  the  next  day  the 
Duke  himself  and  Lennox  lost  their  heads.  The  jury  consisted  of  the 
following  : — Walter,  Earl  of  Atholl ;  Archibald,  Earl  of  Douglas  ;  Alex- 
ander, Earl  of  Ross,  Lord  of  the  Isles ;  Alexander  Stewart,  Earl  of 
Mar ;  William,  Earl  of  Angus ;  William,  Earl  of  Orkney ;  George, 
Earl  of  March  ;  James  Douglas  of  Balveny,  Gilbert  Hay  of  Errol, 
Constable  of  Scotland,  Robert  Stewart  of  Lorn,  Sir  John  Montgomery 
of  Ardrossan,  Sir  Thomas  Sumerveil  of  Carnwath,  Sir  Herbert  Herris 
of  Terregles,  Sir  James  Douglas  of  Dalkeith,  Sir  Robert  Cunninghame 
of  Kilmaures,  Sir  Alexander  Livingstone  of  Callender,  Sir  Thomas 
Hay  of  Yester,  Sir  William  Borthwick  of  that  ilk.  Sir  Alexander 
Ogilvy,  Sheriff  of  Angus,  Sir  John  Forrester  of  Corstorphine,  and  Sir 
Walter  Ogilvy  of  Lintrethan. 

Writing  of  Robert  Stewart,  Tytler  says,  "  this  powerful  baron  was 
in  strict  alliance  with  the  house  of  Douglas,"  and  he  shared,  in  conse- 
quence, the  imprisonment,  in  1439,  of  his  brothers,  Sir  James  and 
William,  by  the  faction  of  the  Lord  Kalendar.  He  married,  before 
1 409,  Margaret,  fourth  daughter  of  Robert,  first  Duke  of  Albany,  and 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  _6i 

great-granddaughter  of  Walter,  sixth  High  Steward,  by  his  wife 
Marjory,  daughter  of  King  Robert  Bruce,  as  we  find  from  a  charter  in 
the  Rolls,  dated  about  that  year,  by  the  Duke  "  Roberto  Senescallo  de 
Lorn,  filio  suo."     By  her  he  left  issue — 

1.  John  Stewart  of  Lorn,  his  successor. 

2.  Walter,  subsequently  of  Innermeath.  He  married  Mar- 
garet Lindsay,  "daughter  to  the  Earl  of  Crawfurd's  ancestor,"  says 
Duncan  Stewart,  and  had  issue.  His  line  became  extinct,  on  the 
death,  without  issue,  in  1625,  of  James,  seventh  Lord  Innermeath,  and 
second  Earl  of  A  thole  of  the  line  of  Stewart  of  Innermeath,  the  earldom 
of  Athole  and  the  Innermeath  estates  passing  to  his  wife's  nephew, 
John,  third  Earl  of  Tullibardine,  who  surrendered  the  newer  title  for 
the  older  dignity  of  Athole,  both  earldoms,  however,  becoming  united 
in  1670. 

3.  Alan,  who  seems  to  have  left  no  issue. 

4.  David,  Bishop  of  Moray  from  1463  to  1477. 

5.  Robert,  of  whom  no  records  remain. 

Also  two  daughters,  one  married  to  John,  second  Lord  Lindsay  of 
the  Byres ;  the  other  to  Robert,  eighth  Lord  Erskine. 

John,  Lord  of  Lorn  and  Innermeath,  eldest  son  of  Robert  and 
his  wife,  Margaret,  daughter  of  Robert,  Duke  of  Albany  and  Earl  of 
Buchan,  succeeded  his  father  in  the  great  family  estates  in  Argyll, 
Perth,  Kinross,  Forfar,  Clackmannan,  and  Fife.  He  married  as  his  first 
wife  a  lady  whose  name  has  not  been  recorded  by  genealogists,  by 
whom  he  had  three  daughters,  regarding  the  order  of  whose  birth  not 
even  the  families  of  their  husbands  are  agreed.  Crawford,  writing  in 
1 710,  followed  by  Duncan  Stewart  in  1730,  and  by  Sir  Robert  Douglas, 
gives  the  order  thus : — ist,  Isabel,  married  to  Colin,  first  Earl  of 
Argyll  ;  2d,  Margaret,  married  to  Sir  Colin  Campbell,  of  Glenurchy ; 
and  3rd,  Marion,  married  to  Arthur  Campbell,  of  Ottar.  Sir  Bernard 
Burke  in  his  "  Peerage"  says,  "  Colin,  Lord  Campbell,  who  was  created 
Earl  of  Argyll,    1457,  married   Isabel  Stewart,    eldest   daughter  and 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


co-heiress  of  John,  Lord  of  Lorn,  and  in  consequence  added  the  galley 
to  his  achievement,  with  the  designation  of  Lord  Lorn  to  his  other 
titles."  Under  the  head  of  Breadalbane,  we  find  in  Burke  that  Sir  Colin 
Campbell,  of  Glenurchy,  "  married,  secondly,  Margaret,  second  daughter 
and  co-heir  of  John,  Lord  Lorn,  with  whom  he  got  a  third  of  that 
lordship,"  and  quartered  henceforward  the  galley  of  Lorn  with  his 
paternal  achievement. 

Such  is  the  generally  received  version  of  the  order  of  birth  of  the 
three  daughters  of  Sir  John  Stewart,  and  of  the  manner  in  which  the 
lordship  of  Lorn  passed  to  the  Argyll  family.  Later  investigations, 
however,  clearly  prove  that  this  account  of  the  acquisition  of  Lorn  is 
altogether  incorrect,  and  that  the  statements  of  the  respective  ages  of 
the  two  elder  daughters,  as  given  by  the  two  houses  of  Argyll  and 
Breadalbane,  do  not  agree  with  each  other. 

In  a  curious  MS.,  deposited  in  the  British  Museum,  entitled  "  Mis- 
cellanies Historical,  copied  from  a  MS.  which  was  in  the  possession  of 
Archibald,  Duke  of  Argyll,  in  the  year  1 756,"  we  find  some  "  informa- 
tion anent  the  pedigree  of  the  noble  and  ancient  house  of  Lochow."  At 
page  31,  it  is  narrated  that  "  Colin  Mulle,  Bold  Earl  Colin,  Lieutenant 
of  the  Isles,  and  Chancellor  of  Scotland  to  James  II.,  brought  many 
actions  to  this  house,  especially  the  lordship  of  Lorn,  by  marriage  of 
Isabella  Stewart,  heretrix  of  Lorn,  and  one  of  the  three  heretrices. 
Glenurchy  married  the  eldest,  and  the  laird  of  the  third,  the  earl 

being  always  superior  to  all.  It  were  tedious  to  set  down  all  the 
troubles  and  passages  of  his  time,  especially  with  the  Stewarts  of  Inner- 
meath,  who  pretended  to  be  Lords  of  Lorn  by  tailzie.  It  is  to  be 
remembered  that  the  three  heretrices  were  daughters  to  John  Stewart, 
Lord  of  Lorn,  called  John  Mourach,  which  is  to  say,  lipper  John,  who 
succeeded  to  his  brother,  Robert  Stewart.  This  John  married  the  Lord 
of  the  Isles  and  Earl  of  Ross'  daughter,  upon  whom  he  begat  three 
heretrices. 

"  Here  may  be  opened  an  ocean  of  discourse  as  to  the  decay  of  Great

Sorle,  his  house  changed  for  his  eldest  son,  Dougal,  by  the  Stewarts  of 
Innermeath  to  the  Campbells,  who  keep  it  to  this  day,  and  how  the 
M'Dougalls  did  keep  it  for  ten  successions — nine  lawful  and  one  bas- 
tard,— and  this  lipper  lord  was  slain  by  the  bastard  M'Dougall,  and  how 
the  Stewarts  did  kill  the  M'Dougall  again,  and  in  the  end  with  how 
many  varieties  and  troubles  it  did  come  to  this  earl,  who  was  in  the  end 
compelled  to  give  the  Stewarts  satisfaction,  as  the  indenture  between  this 
earl  and  Walter,  Lord  Innermeath,  doth  bear,  dated  August  1469,  as 
likewise  to  satisfy  the  two  bastards  of  Dougald's,  viz.,  M'Oneil, 
of  Brue,  and  the  Laird  of  Rarey,  whose  houses  do  both  stand  to 
this  day." 

Without  pausing  to  remark  upon  the  blunders  and  admissions  of 
this  curious  statement,  we  turn  to  the  account  given  in  the  family 
history  of  the  Glenorchy  or  Breadalbane  branch  of  the  Campbell 
family. 

In  the  "  Black  Book  of  Taymouth,"  a  family  history,  written  by 
Master  William  Bowie,  family  notary  and  pedagogue  of  the  Breadalbane 
family,  compiled  from  the  Breadalbane  papers  in  1598,  and  printed  in 
1845,  we  read  that  "Sir  Colene  Campbell,  eftir  the  deceis  of  his  said 
wyffe,  Jonett  Stewart,  eldest  dochtir  to  William"  (evidently  a  mistake 
for  John)  "Stewart,  Lord  of  Lome  [with  quhom  he  gatt  in  name  of  tochir- 
gude  the  auchtene  markland  of  the  Bray  off  Lome,  hir  father  being 
then  alyve.  Bot  eftir  hir  said  father  his  deceis,  the  haill  lordschip  of 
Lome  falling  to  his  thre  dochteris,  heretrices  thair  off,  the  said  Sir 
Colene,  be  vertew  of  his  vyff,  eldest  of  the  three,  fell  to  the  haill 
superioritie  of  the  lordschip  of  Lome,  and  first  thrid  thairoff,  extending 
to  tua  hundredth  and  fyftie  mark  landis.]  On  her  he  begatt  ane  son,

ane  dochtir,  callit  Geillis  Campbell,  quha  wes  mariet  on  M'Cowle  in 
Lome."  The  latter  was  a  member  of  a  family  of  which  we  shall  speak 
hereafter,  and  was  a  descendant  of  the  old  Macdougalls — in  Gaelic, 
M'Coules — of  Lorn.     We  further  read  in  the  "  Black  Book  of  Tay-

mouth,"  that  "the  said  Sir  Colene  being  tutour  to  his  brother  sone  Colene 
Campbell  (quha  wes  maid  first  Erie  of  Argyle),  he  mariet  him  on  the 
secund  heretrix  of  Lome,  and  thaireftir  (for  the  favour  he  bure  to  him, 
and  the  standing  of  his  Hows),  frelie  dimittit  unto  him  the  superioritie 
of  the  hail  lordschip  of  Lome."  Playfair,  in  his  "  British  Family  Anti- 
quity," confirms  this  account  of  the  ancestor  of  the  Breadalbane  family 
marrying  the  elder  daughter,  and  his  nephew,  the  younger,  which, 
indeed,  their  relative  ages  make  most  likely  ;  but  the  probability  almost 
becomes  certainty  when  we  see  the  order  in  which  the  names  of  the 
daughters  occur  in  the  sasines  of  their  shares  in  the  inheritance  of  Castle 
Gloom  and  Dollar.  Merely  remarking  at  present,  however,  the  great 
discrepancy  between  the  account  given  in  these  family  histories,  and  the 
generally  accepted  version  as  given  by  Burke,  together  with  the  impor- 
tant difference  thereby  involved  as  to  the  alleged  succession  to  Lorn,  we 
turn  to  facts  established  by  deeds  and  charters,  which  again  widely 
differ  from  both. 

By  a  charter,  now  in  the  Breadalbane  charter-chest,  dated  1448,  by 
John  Stewart,  Lord  of  Lorn,  consequent  on  a  contract  of  marriage  between 
his  "  derest  cousing  and  mach,"  Sir  Colene  Campbell,  of  Glenorquhay, 
and  his  daughter,  Jonet  Stewart,  there  was  granted  to  Sir  Colene,  out  of 
the  lands  of  Lorn,  the  five  merk  land  of  Letterbean,  and  half  a  merk 
land  between  Leakansumar  and  the  rivulet  called  Allmothle,  with  the 
Isle  of  Inchconnan,  and  other  isles  thereto  attached,  in  Ardchattan ;  a 
penny  land  of  Elarga  and  Blara,  a  penny  land  of  Corelame,  a  penny 
land  of  Cluchaich,  a  penny  land  of  Pollandowich,  a  penny  land  of 
Aeynyh,  Lochaty-leod,  with  the  loch  Lochaty-leod,  and  a  penny  land  of 
Drumnaschealge  and  Blaranedyn,  in  Kilmelfort,  and  a  penny  land  of 
Finglen,  in  Kilninver.  The  lands  of  Letterbean,  the  most  important  of 
those  enumerated,  are  on  the  south-east  side  of  Ben  Cruachan,  on  the 
north-west  shore  of  Lochawe,  and  were  consequently  a  very  fitting 
dower  to  Sir  John's  daughter  on  her  marriage  with  the  laird  of  Glen- 
orchy,  to  whose  estates  they  are  adjacent.      Laing  writes,  "  The  seal 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  65 

attached  to  this  charter  by  Sir  John  Stewart,  Lord  Lorn,  is  in  good 
preservation,  and  well  executed,  yet  from 
the  manner  in  which  the  charges  are  dis- 
posed, in  outrage  of  all  heraldic  rule,  a 
correct  blazon  is  rendered  almost  impos- 
sible. 

"The  following  description  may  give  a 
correct  enough  idea  of  the  seal,  but  certainly 
not  of  the  noble  coat  of  Stewart  of  Lorn  : — 
Quarterly  first,  per  fesse  the  base  counter 
compony,  in  chief,  a  buckle,  the  strap  extending  towards  the  dexter ; 
second  and  third,  a  galley  in  full  sail ;  fourth,  per  fess,  the  ^/zz&gt;/"  counter 
compony,  and  in  base  a  garb.  This  has  evidently  been  intended  for  a 
composed  coat ;  the  counter  compony  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters 
being  meant  for  the  fess  chequ6,  with  the  buckle  marking  the  paternal 
descent ;  the  galley  in  the  second  and  third  quarters  indicating  Lorn ; 
and  the  garb  in  base  of  the  fourth  quarter,  Buchan."  The  inscription  on 
the  seal  is — "  Sigillum  Johi  Steuward  Domini  de  Lourn." 

The  garb  was  the  distinctive  feudal  cognisance  of  the  earldom  of 
Buchan,  and  was  assumed  by  John  of  Lorn  from  his  grandfather,  Robert, 
Duke  of  Albany,  having  succeeded  his  brother,  Alexander  Stewart,  the 
Wolf  of  Badenoch,  in  that  earldom  in  1394.  This  grant  of  land  to 
Glenorchy,  on  his  marriage,  was  signed  at  the  castle  of  Glenorchy  by 
Sir  John  Stewart  in  1449. 

The  cousinship  above  referred  to  as  existing  between  Sir  John 
Stewart  and  Sir  Colin  Campbell,  arose  from  Sir  John's  mother  being 
Margaret,  fourth  daughter  of  Robert,  Duke  of  Albany  (not  Murdoch,  as 
is  erroneously  stated  in  the  "  Black  Book  of  Taymouth "),  while  Sir 
Colin's  mother  was  Margaret's  elder  sister,  Mariota  or  Marjory,  the 
Duke's  second  daughter. 

In  addition  to  the  five  and  a  half  merk  lands  conveyed  by  the 
above-mentioned  charter  to  his  eldest  daughter  Janet  and  her  husband, 

I 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Sir  Colin  Campbell,  out  of  the  estate  of  Lorn, — a  dower  certainly  not 
in  the  very  slightest  degree  approaching,  as  stated  in  the  Black  Book 
of  Taymouth,  to  a  third  of  that  lordship,  then  valued  at  about  ;^450 
Scots, — she  and  each  of  her  sisters  were  to  receive,  on  their  father's 
death,  one-third  of  his  patrimonial  estate  in  the  county  of  Clackmannan. 
These  Clackmannan  lands  had  now  been  in  the  family  for  four  genera- 
tions, but  with  the  object  of  keeping  the  more  important  Lordship  of 
Lorn,  and  Barony  of  Innermeath  intact  for  his  male  heirs,  Sir  John 
determined  to  divide  this,  though  the  older  family  property,  among  his 
three  daughters.  With  this  view  these  lands  were  excluded  from  the 
new  grant  of  Lorn  and  Innermeath  in  1452,  and  were  consequently, 
after  his  death,  divided  among  his  daughters  as  heirs  portioners ;  and 
we  find  on  9th  April  1465,  Duncan  Campbell,  son  of  Sir  Colin 
Campbell,  Knight,  Dame  Isabel  Stewart,  and  Marion  Stewart, 
each  seized  "  in  all  and  haill  the  third  part  of  the  lands  of  Dollar  and 
Gloum." 

The  third  part  of  these  lands  which  fell  to  the  share  of 
Duncan  Campbell  of  Glenorchy  was  resigned  by  him  in  favour  of 
Colin,  Earl  of  Argyll,  as  appears  from  the  Inventory  of  the  Argyll 
Charters ;  and  in  the  Black  Book  of  Taymouth  we  find  "  Item 
the  said  Sir  Duncan  excambit  the  third  of  the  lands  of  Dollar 
and  Acharnside,  with  the  landis  of  Kilbryde  beyand  on  the  side  of 
Lochfyne." 

There  is  no  mention  of  any  deed  conveying  the  part  which  fell  to 
Marion  Stewart,  wife  of  Arthur  Campbell  of  Ottar,  but  Argyll  in  some 
way  or  other  acquired  this  part  also,  as  there  is  a  charter  of  confirma- 
tion by  James  IV.,  dated  nth  May  1497,  of  a  charter  by  the  superior, 
the  Bishop  of  Dunkeld,  in  which  it  is  expressly  stated  that  the  Bishop 
granted  to  Archibald,  Earl  of  Argyll,  all  the  lands  of  Dollar  and  Gloom. 
It  is  possible  that  the  worthy  Master  William  Bowie  in  his  zeal  for  the 
standing  of  the  house  of  Breadalbane,  may  have  confounded  this  renun- 
ciation of  Gloom,  with  the  alleged  free  demission  to  the  Earl  of  Argyll 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  67 

of  the  "  superioritie  of  the  haill  Lordschip  of  Lorn,"  which,  as  will  be 
conclusively  shown,  never  fell  as  an  inheritance  to  the  daughters  of  Sir 
John  Stewart.  Be  this  as  it  may,  the  result  was  to  place  Argyll  in  pos- 
session of  this  large  estate,  with  its  ancient  castle  of  Gloom,  afterwards 
and  until  1 664,  a  frequent  and  favourite  residence  of  the  Argylls  under 
the  name  of  Castle  Campbell,  a  designation  assumed  under  the  autho- 
rity of  an  Act  of  the  Scots  Parliament  in  1489.  The  castle  was  burned 
down  by  the  Macleans  in  the  army  of  Montrose  in  1664,  when  he  was 
marching  from  the  north  to  the  field  of  Kilsyth,  and  the  estate  was  sold 
by  the  Duke  of  Argyll  in  1808. 

In  making  the  above  settlements  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Lorn  seems 
to  have  considered  that  he  had  acquitted  himself  of  his  obligations  to 
his  female  heirs  and  their  husbands,  for  we  find  that  after  these  grants, 
and  a  special  and  exceptional  charter  in  favour  of  his  kinsman  John 
M'Alan,  or  Macdougal,  called  M'Coule,  which  will  be  afterwards  noticed, 
he  subsequently  surrendered  into  the  hands  of  James  IL  the  Lordship 
of  Lorn,  and  the  baronies  of  Redcastle  and  Innermeath,  for  the  purpose 
of  obtaining  two  fresh  charters  more  distinctly  defining  them,  and  des- 
tining them  anew.  Both  these  new  charters  are  dated  on  the  20th  of 
June  1452,  and  are  given  at  length  in  the  Appendix.  In  the  first  the 
King  grants  all  and  whole  the  Lordship  of  Lorn,  all  and  whole  the 
barony  of  Innermeath,  lying  in  the  sheriffdom  of  Perth,  and  all  and 
whole  the  barony  of  Redcastle,  lying  in  the  sheriffdom  of  Forfar,  "  dilecto 
consanguineo  nostro  Johanni,  Domino  de  Lorn,"  and  the  heirs  male  of 
his  body,  lawfully  procreated  or  to  be  procreated,  whom  failing  to  his 
brother  Walter  Stewart,  and  his  heirs  male,  and  failing  these  to  his 
brother  Alan,  and  his  heirs  male.  In  default  of  these,  the  charter  goes 
on  to  enumerate  the  other  male  relatives  to  whom  the  estates  should 
descend — viz.,  John's  brothers  David  and  Robert,  his  uncles  Sir  Archi- 
bald and  Sir  James  Stewart,  and  his  kinsman  Thomas  Stewart,  and 
the  heirs  male  of  each  in  their  turn,  as  named  ;  and  finally,  failing  all 
these,  to  his  heirs  whatsoever. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


The  other  charter,  dated  the  same  day,  is  much  shorter,  and  refers 
only  to  the  Barony  of  Innermeath,  having  been  drawn  for  the  purpose 
of  obtaining  the  royal  authority  to  include  with  that  barony,  which  was 
entailed  on  heirs  male  by  the  major  charter,  the  lands  of  Ennerdonyand 
Baldenys  in  the  earldom  of  Stratherne  and  sheriffdom  of  Perth,  also 
the  lands  of  Colndrane,  and  of  Maw  in  the  sheriffdom  of  Fife,  also  the 
lands  of  Coltrane  in  the  sheriffdom  of  Kinross,  and  also  the 
lands  of  Kyldeny  in  the  sheriffdom  of  Perth,  all  of  which  lands  were 
incorporated  with,  and  annexed  to,  the  barony  of  Innermeath,  to  be 
held  in  perpetual  tenure  as  part  thereof,  by  John,  Lord  of  Lorn,  and  his 
heirs,  who  were,  as  we  have  seen,  fully  enumerated  in  the  major  charter 
of  the  same  date.  Thus  nothing  could  possibly  be  more  clear  than  Sir 
John  Stewart's  set  purpose  to  exclude  his  daughters,  and  their  descen- 
dants, from  all  share  in  the  Lordship  of  Lorn,  the  baronies  of  Redcastle 
and  Innermeath,  and  the  lands  incorporated  into  the  latter,  until  the 
failure  of  all  the  male  heirs  whom  he  could  enumerate,  even  to  the  most 
remote  degree  ;  but  we  shall  see  how,  after  his  death,  his  intentions 
were  frustrated,  and  who  became  the  possessors  of  the  lands  incorpo- 
rated by  royal  charter  into  the  barony  of  Innermeath. 

We  turn  now  to  the  family  of  Macdougall  of  Lorn,  from  whom  the 
lands  of  Lorn  came,  and  from  their  alliance  with  whom  the  descendants 
of  Sir  John  Stewart  still  bear  on  their  armorial  shield  the  galley  of 
Lorn.  This  ancient  clan  derives  its  name  and  descent  from  Dugall, 
the  eldest  son  of  Somerled,  the  powerful  chief  of  the  Western  Isles. 
His  descendant,  Alexander  Macdougal,  chief  of  Lorn,  married  the  third 
daughter  of  the  Red  Comyn,  slain  by  Robert  de  Brus  in  the  Dominican 
Church  at  Dumfries  in  1305,  and  adhered  faithfully  to  the  fortunes  of 
his  wife's  family.  Bruce,  after  his  defeat  at  Methven  on  19th  June 
1306,  retreated  into  the  mountains  of  Breadalbane  with  less  than  three 
hundred  men,  and  approached  the  borders  of  Argyllshire,  where  he  was 
attacked  and  defeated  by  Alexander  Macdougall  at  the  head  of  one 
thousand  men,  at  Dalree,  the  "king's  field,"  in  Strathfillan.    It  was  at  this 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  69 

battle  that  the  famous  "  Brooch  of  Lorn,"  celebrated  by  Sir  Walter  Scott 
in  his  poem  of  "  The  Lord  of  the  Isles,"  was  wrested  from  the  Bruce. 

In  1308,  however,  King  Robert  amply  avenged  his  defeat,  routing 
the  Macdougalls  at  the  Pass  of  Awe,  and  compelling  Alexander  to  take 
refuge  in  his  castle  of  Dunstaffnage,  about  twelve  miles  distant,  which 
was  at  once  besieged  by  the  king.     Barbour  says — 

"  The  king  that  stoute  wes,  stark  and  bauld, 
Till  Dunstaffynich  rycht  sturdily 
A  sege  set." 

Alexander  soon  surrendered  to  King  Robert,  and  swore  fealty  to 
him ;  but  his  son,  John,  "  rebellious  as  he  wont  to  be,"  says  Barbour, 
refused  to  submit,  and  fled  to  England.  After  the  battle  of  Bannock- 
burn,  John  was  appointed  by  Edward  1 1,  to  the  command  of  an  English 
fleet,  sent  to  encourage  the  chiefs  of  the  Western  Islands  to  detach 
themselves  anew  from  the  Scottish  crown.  Bruce,  on  his  return  from 
Ireland,  sailed  to  attack  him,  routed  his  forces,  dispersed  his  ships, 
and  took  John  himself  captive.  He  died  a  prisoner  in  Lochleven 
Castle  ;  but  his  son,  John  or  Ewen,  marrying  Johanna,  only  child  of  the 
Princess  Maude,  daughter  of  David  II.,  by  her  husband,  Thomas  Isaac 
or  Ysac,  was  restored  to  his  patrimonial  possessions.  This  John  died 
without  male  issue,  but  left  two  daughters,  the  elder  of  whom,  as  we 
have  seen,  carried  the  estate  of  Lorn  to  Sir  Robert  Stewart  of  Schan- 
bothy,  who  exchanged  it  with  his  elder  brother.  Sir  John  Stewart,  who 
had  married  the  younger  daughter.  The  chieftainship  of  the  clan  Mac- 
dougall  passed,  without  the  estate,  to  John  Macdougalls  brother,  Alan, 
upon  whose  son,  John  M'AIan  M'Coule  or  Macdougall,  John  Stewart, 
Lord  of  Lorn,  bestowed,  in  1451,  the  lands  and  castle  of  Dunolly, 
which,  with  other  lands  granted  at  the  same  time,  are  still  held  by  his 
descendants. 

Together  with  the  lords  of  the  Isles,  the  Macdougalls  had  always 
aspired  to  hold  a  position  independent  of  the  Scottish  crown,  and  were 
almost  continually  in  correspondence  with  England,  assuming  the  right 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


to  enter  into  treaties  and  conclude  peace  as  independent  princes.  It 
was  through  Lorn  that  the  Western  Islanders  invaded  the  more  central 
parts  of  Scotland,  and  it  was  thus  of  high  political  importance  that  a 
dominion  of  such  consequence,  from  its  extent  and  position,  should  be 
held  by  sure  and  loyal  friends  of  the  crown.  King  Robert  I.  had  suffered 
so  much  from  the  relentless  animosity  of  the  various  branches  of  this 
family,  that  to  diminish  their  power  became  a  prominent  feature  of  his 
policy,  and  he  bequeathed  it  for  the  guidance  of  his  successors.  These 
considerations  leave  little  doubt  that  the  royal  sanction  had  been  readily 
accorded,  in  the  charter  by  King  Robert  II.,  to  the  passing  of  the 
inheritance,  by  the  marriage  of  the  heiress,  to  a  Stewart,  who  was  so 
closely  allied  in  blood  to  the  king ;  and  they  may  also  serve  to  explain 
Sir  John  Stewart's  care  to  secure  the  possession  of  the  lordship  to  his 
own  male  heirs,  and  his  making,  with  that  view,  provision  for  his 
daughters  out  of  his  Clackmannan  estate. 

The  Highlanders  adhered  strictly  to  the  system  of  hereditary  suc- 
cession in  the  male  line,  although  that  system  was  very  different  from 
the  feudal  one.  The  difference  between  the  Highland  law  of  tanistry, 
which  determined  the  succession  to  the  chiefship  and  the  superiority 
of  lands,  and  the  feudal  law,  was  that  under  the  former  the  brothers 
succeeded  before  the  sons,  as  nearer  lineal  descendants,  by  a  generation, 
of  the  founder  of  the  tribe.  Bruce's  claim  to  the  throne  was  thus 
founded  on  tanistry,  as  being  the  son  of  Isabella,  second  daughter,  while 
Baliol  was  the  grandson  of  Margaret,  the  eldest  daughter  of  David, 
Earl  of  Huntingdon,  brother  of  William  the  Lion.  Ferriales  were  alto- 
gether excluded  from  succession  either  to  the  chiefship  or  the  family 
property,  the  possession  of  the  latter  being  essential  to  support  the 
dignity  of  the  chiefs  state,  and  the  hospitality  which  he  was  called  upon 
to  exercise.  Thus  the  descent  of  Lorn  to  the  daughters  of  John,  of 
Ergadia,  had  been  in  direct  violation  of  the  law  of  the  Gael,  as  it  left 
their  uncle — who  was  the  head  of  the  family,  the  chief  of  the  clan,  and 
its  leader  in  the  field, — without  the  means  of  supporting  his  position  or 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


his  power.      But  no  doubt  this  had  been  precisely  the  object  which  the 
Crown  had  been  especially  desirous  to  effect. 

Sir  John  Stewart  of  Lorn,  however,  seems  to  have  felt  the  hardship, 
not  to  say  the  injustice,  of  permanently  depriving  the  heir,  who  was  also 
his  own  kinsman,  of  such  an  old  and  powerful  family  as  the  Macdougalls, 
of  all  the  wide  lands,  which  should  have  descended  to  him  according  to 
the  customs  of  his  race.  He  consequently  executed,  in  145 1,  a  deed 
granting  to  John  M'Alan  or  Macdougall,  called  M'Cowle,  which  is  the 
Gaelic  synonym  for  Macdougall,  with  remainder  to  his  son,  John  Keir 
Macdougall,  and  his  heirs  male,  the  29  merk  land  of  the  island  of  Car- 
rarry,  the  6  merk  land  of  DunoUych,  the  8  merk  land  of  Glensellach,  the 
10  merk  land  of  Gallawnoche  and  of  Colgyn,  the  10  merk  land  of  Melliag, 
and  the  8  merk  land  of  Ardnahowe,  in  Kilbride  ;  the  8  merk  land  of 
Ardnohowe,  and  the  8  merk  land  of  Dowanchowe,  in  Kilinver ;  also, 
the  8  merk  land  of  Dowach,  the  10  merk  land  of  Melrog,  the  22  merk 
land  of  Degnish,  and  others  in  Kilbrandon.  He  also  conferred  on 
John  M'Alan  and  his  heirs  the  office  of  baillie  of  all  the  lands  in  Lorn 
which  he  then  had  or  might  have ;  and,  further,  gave  to  John,  and  his 
son,  John  Keir,  the  onerous  and  very  noteworthy  trust  of  the  guardian- 
ship and  pupilage  (alumniam  et  nutrimentum)  of  his  heirs.  John 
M'Allan  or  Macdougall  was  Sir  John  Stewart's  nearest  relative  of  the 
family  of  Macdougall,  as  well  as  the  chief  of  the  clan,  and  probably  the 
Lord  of  Lorn  desired  by  his  munificence  to  his  kinsman,  and  the  trust 
he  reposed  in  him,  to  secure  his  support  and  that  of  the  clan  Mac- 
dougall, for  his  youthful  son,  Dugald  Stewart,  then  about  six  years  old, 
whom  he  intended  to  make  his  heir. 

These  grants  were  made  without  condition,  except  the  usual  clause 
of  rendering  to  the  granter  homage  and  service  against  all  except  the 
king ;  and,  as  baillie,  of  paying  to  him  one-third  part  of  all  the  rents  and 
casualties  of  the  lands  of  Lorn. 

Sir  John  Stewart  had  thus  replaced  his  kinsman,  Macdougall,  not 
only  in  possession  of  the  castle  of  Dunolly — an  ancient  stronghold  of 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


the  family,  and  important  as  commanding  the  Sound  of  Mull,  Loch 
Linnhe,  and  the  Firth  of  Lorn — but  had  endowed  him  with  an  ample 
estate.  The  extent  of  the  lands  in  Lorn  thus  granted  to  MacDougall 
contrasts  very  remarkably  with  the  limited  grant  to  his  eldest  daughter 
out  of  that  lordship,  and  marks  in  a  very  decided  manner  his  respect  for 
the  position  of  male  heirs.  Having  completed  this  significant  act  of 
justice  and  generosity,  Sir  John  proceeded  to  Edinburgh  to  make  the 
further  settlement  of  his  estates  on  male  heirs,  as  previously  detailed. 
Passing  now  to  the  later  years  of  the  life  of  Sir  John  Stewart,  of  Lorn, 
we  find — upon  the  authority  of  MSS.  and  traditions  which  have  been 
handed  down  in  the  families  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin,  and  of  the  Mac- 
larens,  supported  by  the  high  authority  of  Brown  in  his  "  Genealogical 
Tree  of  the  Family  of  Stewart," — that  he  married,  as  his  second  wife, 
the  daughter  of  Maclaren  of  Ardveich,  by  whom  he  had  a  son,  Dugald. 

It  seems  proper  here  to  notice  more  particularly  the  well-known 
genealogical  work  above  referred  to,  published  by  its  author  in  1797, 
after  many  years  of  patient  investigation  and  deep  research.  Sir  Henry 
Steuart  of  Allantoun,  in  reply  to  Andrew  Stuart's  theory  of  the  descent 
of  the  Stuarts  of  Castlemilk,  calls  Mr  Brown  "  the  best  genealogist," 
and  describes  his  work  as,  "  without  doubt,  one  of  the  most  complete 
and  correct  views  of  any  surname  ever  delivered  to  the  public."  A 
very  high  encomium  was  also  passed  upon  it  by  the  Earl  of  Buchan, 
founder  of  the  Society  of  Antiquaries  in  Scotland ;  and  it  further 
received,  in  the  same  year,  the  following  approbation  of  the  Lyon 
Office  in  Edinburgh  ;  one  of  the  duties  of  the  Lyon  King-at-Arms, 
being,  in  the  words  of  Seton,  "  to  record  the  genealogies  of  persons 
descended  from  noble  and  honourable  lineage,  when  supported  by  pro- 
per evidence." 

"  LvoN  Office,  Edinburgh,  ^d  March  1792. 

"  I  have  examined  your  historical  and  genealogical  tree  of  the 
descendants  of  the  Royal  Family  of  Scotland  with  much  satisfaction. 
There  are  two  other  trees  on  the  same  subject — one  compiled  by  Mr 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Duncan  Stewart,  the  other  by  the  late  Sir  Robert  Douglas, — but  I 
observe  that  yours  is  more  complete  and  full  than  both  of  them  put 
together,  and,  consequently  more  valuable."

In  the  compilation  of  Mr  Brown's  work,  he  had  the  advantage  of 
access  to  family  papers,  many  of  which  have  since  unfortunately  disap- 
peared. Among  those  examined  and  quoted  by  him,  having  especial 
reference  to  our  subject,  are  the  Appin,  Achnacone,  and  Invernahyle 
MSS.  ;  and  upon  the  authority  of  the  information  before  him,  he  has 
recorded  the  second  marriage  of  John,  of  Lorn,  to  the  daughter  of  Mac- 
laren.  The  value  of  a  family  history  must  depend  entirely  upon  its 
correctness,  and  it  cannot  for  one  moment  be  supposed  that  Mr  Brown 
would  have  diminished  the  value  or  trustworthiness  of  a  general  history 
of  the  family  of  Stewart,  by  allowing  an  error  of  this  sort  to  appear  in 
his  work,  out  of  regard  for  the  susceptibilities  of  any  particular  branch 
of  the  family.  It  is  certain  that  he  has  not  done  so  in  the  case  of  any 
of  the  very  distinguished  branches  where  the  bar  sinister  really  exists, 
for  it  has  been  recorded  in  every  instance  with  unflinching  impartiality, 
and  there  is  no  conceivable  reason  why  he  should  have  made  any  excep- 
tion in  the  case  of  the  family  of  Appin. 

The  existence  of  this  son  Dugald,  and  the  intention  of  subsequently 
legitimating  him,  make  at  once  apparent  John  of  Lorn's  grounds  for  the 
very  remarkable,  and,  indeed,  otherwise  totally  unintelligible  appoint- 
ment of  the  Macdougalls,  father  and  son,  as  the  guardians  of  his  heirs, 
for  the  reason  that  the  interests  of  his  own  daughters  and  brothers  were 
plainly  inimical  to  those  of  the  youthful  son,  who  was  his  destined  heir. 
The  appointment  could  not  have  been  made  with  the  view  of  protecting 
the  interests  of  his  daughters,  for  those  daughters  were  not  only  abso- 
lutely the  very  last  in  remainder,  but  were  married  to  husbands  of 
whose  power  to  protect  them  there  could  be  no  possible  doubt.  Nor 
could  it  have  been  made  in  the  interests  of  his  brothers  or  their  children, 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


for  those  brothers  were  men  of  at  least  middle  age,  certainly  requiring 
no  guardianship  in  their  own  case,  and  being  themselves  the  persons 
to  appoint  guardians  for  their  own  children,  if  the  succession  to  Lorn 
were  to  devolve  upon  them. 

We  have  seen  that  Dugald  Stewart's  mother  was  of  the  clan  Mac- 
laren.  This  clan  is  descended  from  "  Labhrain,"  a  Gaelic  name  pro- 
nounced like  Laurin,  and  it  is  supposed  to  be  identical  with  "  Loarn." 
Loam  was  one  of  the  three  sons  of  Ere,  one  of  the  original  founders  of 
the  Dalriadic  kingdom.  The  Maclarens  were  certainly  in  possession  of 
Tyrie  in  Perthshire  in  1 296,  and  they  also  occupied  lands  in  Balquidder 
and  Stratherne,  where  they  acquired  considerable  power.  They  suffered 
severely  from  the  lawless  attacks  of  their  neighbours,  the  Macgregors, 
but  maintained  their  position  well  among  the  neighbouring  septs.  No 
one  was  allowed  to  enter  the  parish  church  of  Balquidder  until  the  Mac- 
larens were  all  seated  ;  and  in  one  of  the  many  frays  arising  out  of  this 
pretension,  the  parson,  himself  a  Maclaren,  was  killed.  After  the  earl- 
dom of  Stratherne  was  vested  in  the  Crown  as  a  Palatine  honour  in 
1371,  the  Maclarens  held  their  lands  as  "kindly  tenants"  of  the  king 
till  1508,  when  they  were  granted  the  more  secure  tenure  of  feuars,  and 
the  clan  afterwards  followed  the  banner  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin.  It  was 
one  of  this  family  who  was  the  real  hero  of  the  story  which  relates  the 
escape  of  the  Jacobite  gentleman  from  his  captors  by  rolling  down  the 
Devil's  Beef  Tub,  near  Moffat,  as  narrated  by  Sir  Walter  Scott 
in  "  Redgauntlet."  Dugald  Stewart's  mother  was  a  daughter  of 
Maclaren  of  Ardveich,  a  gentleman  of  position  and  family,  as  is  con- 
clusively shown  by  his  ancestor,  Laurin  of  Ardveich,  being  one  of 
the  Scottish  barons  who,  with  Conan  of  Balquidder  and  Maurice  of 
Tyrie,  were  required,  as  heads  of  the  clan  Laurin,  to  sign  the  Ragman 
Roll  in  1296. 

Sir  John  Stewart  of  Lorn  had  been  at  the  tryst  of  Creifif, — it  being 
customary  for  chiefs  to  attend  these  trysts,  where  many  affairs  of  busi- 
ness and  politics  were  arranged, — and,  on  his  return,  he  met  in  Glen 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  7S 

Fillan  with  a  wedding  party  from  Ardveich.  He  joined  the  company, 
and  became  enamoured  of  the  daughter  of  the  house.  The  lineal 
descendants  of  the  Maclarens  of  Ardveich  still  reside  there,  and  the 
house  in  which  John  of  Lorn  stayed  on  the  occasion  of  his  visits  is  still 
preserved  with  scrupulous  care. 

The  valuable  records  belonging  to  the  Appin  family,  which  were 
accessible  to  Brown  when  he  compiled  his  genealogical  tree,  have  unfor- 
tunately disappeared,  and  many  of  the  Ardveich  papers  were  destroyed 
in  1645,  when  Alister  M'Colla  burned  the  house.  The  traditions  of 
the  Stewarts  of  Appin,  and  those  of  the  Maclarens,  are,  however,  found 
to  be  so  nearly  identical,  that  it  will  suffice  to  give  those  of  the  Mac- 
larens, which  are  set  down  nearly  in  the  same  words  as  they  have  been 
related  by  Mr  Donald  Maclaren,  Ardveich,  the  present  representative 
of  the  old  barons,  who  has  found  the  details  recorded  in  the  papers  of 
his  family  still  existing. 

Dugald  Stewart  was  born  in  1445  ;  and  these  records  say  that  he 
resided  at  Ardveich  till  1463,  when  his  father  sent  him  a  message 
directing  him  to  come  to  Dunstaffnage  with  his  mother.  They  set  out 
as  a  bridal  party,  with  pipes  and  banners,  accompanied  by  a  party  of 
Dugald's  kinsmen  from  Lorn,  and  some  of  his  mother's  friends,  the 
Maclarens.  A  Gaelic  bard  has  commemorated  the  departure  of  Dugald 
and  his  mother  from  Ardveich,  in  a  poem  or  ballad,  of  which  only 
four  verses  are  now  extant.  They  clearly  show  that  the  party  had 
set  out  for  the  purpose  of  the  marriage,  and  Dugald's  consequent 
legitimation,

The  following  translation  is  by  Mr  Charles  Stewart  of  Tighnduin, 
whose  zeal  and  literary  abilities  have  been  of  great  service  in  the  com- 
pilation of  this  genealogy  : — ■ 

"  That  day  you  left  Lochearnside  with  your  gentle  mother  on  your 
arm,  you  were  a  hero  tall  and  powerful,  and  well  did  your  mountain 
dress  adorn  you. 

"  Before  you  was  a  banner  and  a  pipe  playing  gladly  ;  your  sword 
naked  and  gleaming  in  your  hand ;  your  company,  the  youth  of  clan 
Laurin — men  tall  and  sprightly,  and  full  of  activity. 

"  Young  Dugald,  akin  you  are  to  him  now  wearing  the  royal  crown  ; 
and  in  your  pulses  is  flowing  gleefully  the  blood  which  makes  you  of 
a  mighty  race. 

"  Great  will  be  the  feast  in  yon  Dun  in  the  west,  when,  with  grace- 
ful courtesy,  you  both  reach  it.  Now,  may  health  and  bliss  never- 
failing  attend  the  wife  now  leaving  for  Dunstaffnage." 

Shortly  before  this  time,  John  II.,  Earl  of  Ross  and  Lord  of  the 
Isles,  had  entered  into  negotiations, — which  were  finally  concluded  by  a 
treaty  in  February  1462, — with  Edward  IV.  of  England,  to  which 
James,  ninth  and  last  Earl  of  Douglas,  then  exiled  in  England,  was  a 
party.  By  this  treaty,  the  whole  of  Scotland  was  to  hold  of  Edward 
IV.  as  superior,  while  that  portion  of  it  north  of  the  Forth  was  to  be 
equally  divided  between  the  Earl  of  Ross,  Donald  Balloch,  and  the 
Earl  of  Douglas,  the  latter,  in  addition,  to  have  possession  of  his  large 
estates  between  the  Forth  and  the  English  border.  The  Earl  of  Ross, 
desirous  of  strengthening  his  party  on  the  eve  of  so  great  an  enterprise, 
seems  to  have  soua^ht  the  assistance  of  his  kinsman,   Macdougall  or 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


M'Cowle,  as  head  of  another  branch  of  the  family.  The  chief,  however, 
John  Keir  Macdougall,  to  whom,  with  his  father,  John  M'Alan,  Sir  John 
Stewart,  had  made  such  munificent  grants,  seems  to  have  remained 
faithful  to  his  allegiance  to  his  sovereign,  and  to  the  trust  reposed  in 
him  ;  but  a  second  son,  Alan,  supported  by  a  number  of  the  clan,  among 
others,  by  an  ambitious  illegitimate  kinsman  and  namesake,  Alan, 
joined  the  conspiracy.  We  find  in  various  histories — Buchanan's, 
Abercrombie's,  and  the  "  Auchinleck  Chronicle,"  that,  in  1461,  "Allan 
of  Lorn  of  the  Wood,"  seized  upon  his  elder  brother  "  Kerr,"  and  im- 
prisoned him  in  a  castle  in  Kerrera,  with  the  intention  of  starving  him 
to  death,  and  succeeding  to  his  lands  ;  but  that  "  Kerr"  was  relieved  by 
the  Earl  of  Argyll,  who  defeated  and  captured  Alan,  and  confined  him 
in  a  dungeon,  where  he  died. 

The  Earl  of  Ross  soon  after  raised  the  standard  of  rebellion,  and 
Alan  M'Dougall,  the  illegitimate,  seems  to  have  occupied  the  position 
of  leader  of  the  disaffected  in  Lorn,  in  succession  to  Alan  of  the  Wood, 
who  had  died  in  prison. 

It  had  become  well  known  that  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Lorn  had 
sent  for  the  daughter  of  Ardveich,  in  order  that  their  marriage  might 
legitimate  their  son,  as  was  done  in  the  similar  case  of  an  heir  of 
Douglas  of  Drumlanrig  a  hundred  years  afterwards.  The  possession 
of  Lorn  by  a  just  and  powerful  noble  like  Sir  John  Stewart,  nearly 
allied  to  the  king,  was  no  doubt  a  great  obstacle  to  the  plans  of  Alan 
M'Cowle  and  his  confederates,  and  they  could  not  view  with  com- 
placency the  probability  of  his  being  succeeded  by  a  youth  of  such 
spirit  and  promise  as  Dugald,  backed,  as  he  would  be,  by  his  mother's 
clan,  who  had  always  been  ardent  friends  of  the  royal  house  of  Stewart. 
It  was  clearly  unfavourable  to  their  designs  that  the  succession  should 
should  devolve  upon  Dugald,  instead  of  his  uncle,  Walter,  who,  from 
advancing  years,  or  from  constitutional  want  of  his  nephew's  conspicuous 
martial  energy,  would  have  been  a  less  formidable  antagonist.  The 
preparations  for  the  reception  of  Dugald  and  his  mother,  and  the  cele- 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


bration  of  the  marriage,  would  make  the  date  of  their  expected  arrival 
at  Dunstaffnage  no  secret,  and  on  that  day  Alan  M'Coule  or  Mac- 
dougall  repaired  to  Dunstaffnage  Castle,  and,  according  to  the  traditions 
of  the  Maclarens,  stabbed  Sir  John  in  the  castle  shortly  before  the 
arrival  of  the  joyous  wedding  party.  The  tradition  of  the  Stewarts  is 
that  the  murder  was  committed  when  Sir  John  was  on  his  way  from  the 
Castle  to  the  chapel,  which  is  close  at  hand,  where  the  marriage  was  to 
be  performed.  This  immaterial  point  is  the  only  divergence  between 
the  traditions  handed  down  in  the  two  families. 

The  murderers  fled  instantly  after  Sir  John  was  stabbed  ;  and 
Dugald  would  at  once  have  pursued  them  had  he  not  been  restrained  by 
the  priest,  who  pointed  out  that  no  time  was  to  be  lost  in  having  the 
marriage  completed,  as  Lord  Lorn  was  to  all  appearance  mortally 
wounded.  The  rite  was  accordingly  performed,  the  priest  assisting  the 
dying  man  to  place  the  ring  on  the  bride's  finger,  and  the  ceremony 
being  so  public  that  no  doubt  of  its  due  completion  was  entertained  in 
Argyllshire.  Meantime,  however,  Alan  M'Coule  and  his  accomplices 
had  time  to  effect  their  escape. 

The  MacLaren  tradition  records  that  as  Dugald  was  going  from 
Ardveich  to  Dunstaffnage  with  his  mother  and  the  bridal  party,  he  was 
met  by  an  aged  dame,  who  had  the  gift  of  second  sight,  and  who  asked 
him,  "  Whither  are  you  bound  for  to-day  ? "  to  which  he  replied, 
"  What  is  that  to  you,  old  woman  ?  "  adding,  "  I  am  going  to  receive 
some  little  justice."  To  this  she  answered,  "  Well,  I  have  something 
to  say  to  you.  I  have  had  a  dream  that,  as  you  have  been  for  eighteen 
years  known  as  Dugald,  the  illegitimate  of  Ardveich,  so  you  will  for 
twenty-eight  years  be  known  as  the  head  of  the  Stewarts  of  Lorn."  It 
was  in  1469  that  Dugald's  uncle,  Walter,  made  over  to  the  Earl  of 
Argyll  his  alleged  claims  to  Lorn,  and  Dugald,  till  his  death  in  1497, 
was  acknowledged  as  the  head  of  the  Stewarts  of  Lorn,  a  period  of 
twenty-eight  years. 

The  murder  of  John  of  Lorn  seems  to  have  taken  place  in  1463. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


The  MacLaren  tradition  says  that  it  was  in  that  year  Dugald  left 
Ardveich.  In  the  Chronicle,  "  Domini  Jacobi  M'Gregor,  Notarii 
Publici  ac  Decani  Lismorensis,  qui  obiit  circiter  a.d.  1542,"  is  the 
following  sentence  : — 1463,  Dec.  20. — Obitus  Johannis  Stewart,  Domini 
de  Lome,  apud  Dunstaffinicht."  In  the  "  Origines  Parochiales  Scotise," 
it  is  stated  that  there  is  preserved  in  the  Cambridge  University  Library 
the  original  of  an  Act  of  the  Scots  Parliament,  dated  1460,  recommending 
the  King  to  besiege  Dunstaffnage  Castle,  for  the  purpose  of  punishing 
Alan  M'Coule,  who  had  slain  the  king's  kinsman,  John  Lord  of  Lorn. 
This  seems,  however,  to  be  a  misquotation  of  the  date,  as  in  the  Scots 
Acts  of  Parliament  we  find  among  the  record  of  their  transactions,  in  1464, 
the  following  : — itExM  as  tueching  ye  puniciouii  of  Alane  M'Coule  quhilk

ye  faide  dede,  vnd  all  ye  heaft  pait  charge  ze  quiet  z  juri  agayn  ye 
kinge  maiestete."  The  original  of  this  is  also  said  to  be  in  the 
Cambridge  University  Library,  and  is  most  probably  the  same  as  the 
MS.  referred  to  in  the  "  Origines  Parochiales." 

It  is,  therefore,  certain  that  Alane  M'Coule  got  possession  of 
Dunstaffnage  Castle,  but  whether  in  the  confusion  consequent  on  Sir 
John  Stewart's  murder,  or  after  the  battle  with  Dugald  at  Leac-a-dotha, 
is  not  known  with  certainty.  According  to  Boece,  the  original  fortress 
of  Dunstaffnage  was  built  by  one  of  the  Scots  or  Dalriadic  kings, 
Eugenius  or  Ewen,  and  the  "  Stone  of  Destiny,"  Lia  Fail,  on  which 
the  Sovereigns  of  Scotland  were  crowned  at  Scone,  and  are  still 
crowned  in  Westminster  Abbey,  was  kept  here  till  it  was  removed  to 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Scone  by  Kenneth  II.  The  ancient  building  was  an  extensive  erection 
of  wattles  and  clay,  the  solid  stone  castle  being,  as  Mr  Hill  Burton  is 
of  opinion,  built  by  the  Stewarts.  The  castle  is  a  square  of  eighty- 
seven  feet  within  the  walls,  having  round  towers  at  three  of  the  corners, 
and  is  situated  on  a  perpendicular  mass  of  conglomerate  rock,  from  six- 
teen to  twenty  feet  in  height,  near  the  extremity  of  a  low,  perpendicular 
flat  at  the  entrance  to  Loch  Etive.  The  meaning  of  the  name  Dun- 
staffnage  is  said  by  some  authorities  to  be  "  the  fortified  hill  with  two 
islands,"  but  the  true  etymology  seems  to  be  "  Dunsteffanach," — Arx 
Stefani,  as  rendered  by  Boece, — or  the  fort  of  Stephen.  A  short  dis- 
tance to  the  westward  stand  the  remains  of  the  ancient  Gothic  Chapel, 
formerly  surrounded  by  a  burial  ground,  where  repose  the  ashes  of 
many  an  ancient  Scottish  king  and  chieftain.  The  chapel — the  interior 
of  which  is  still  used  as  a  burying  place — is  seventy-two  feet  by  twenty- 
four  feet,  apparently  of  the  thirteenth  or  fourteenth  century,  and  has  the 
early  English  lancets,  and  the  remains  of  a  circular  arched  doorway, 
and  of  the  dog  tooth  ornaments. 

DuGALD  Stewart's  succession  to  his  estates  in  1463  was,  as  might 
be  expected  after  the  commission  of  a  murder  to  defeat  it,  not  a  peace- 
able one.  Not  only  was  the  crime  unpunished,  but  the  perpetrator, 
with  the  assistance  of  the  rebellious  Islesmen,  was  maintaining  himself 
in  Dunstaffnage,  the  principal  castle  and  seat  of  the  owner  of  the 
heritage.  Dugald  was  still  little  more  than  a  boy  in  years,  totally 
inexperienced  in  the  ways  of  the  world,  and  had  consequently  all  the 
more  right  to  expect  the  assistance  of  his  uncles,  and  of  his  connections 
the  Campbells,  in  having  the  murderer  brought  to  justice.  But  no  such 
assistance  was  given,  and  Dugald  was  left  to  his  own  unaided  efforts 
until,  as  has  been  mentioned,  the  Scots  Parliament  moved,  ineffectually, 
some  months  afterwards,  for  the  punishment  of  the  outrage.  It  cannot, 
indeed,  be  forgotten  that  Walter  had  just  seen  the  long  counted  on 
inheritance  of  his  brother  apparently  plucked  from  his  grasp  by  the 
legitimation  of  his  nephew,  and  that  the  death  of  Dugald  might  at  any 


TPIE  STEAVARTS  OF  APPIN. 


time  still  make  him  his  brother's  undoubted  successor.  With  this  con- 
tingency in  view — under  the  circumstances  neither  an  improbable  nor 
a  distant  one — Walter  seems  to  have  contented  himself  at  first  with 
a  policy  of  inaction,  taking  no  measures  to  expel  the  intruder  from 
Dunstaffnage,  or  to  advance  any  claims  upon  the  inheritance.  Had  he 
advanced  any  such  claim,  upon  him  would  have  devolved  the  duty  of 
driving  Alan  M'Coule  from  the  stronghold  of  the  family,  and  of  aveng- 
ing his  brother's  death,  as  in  those  times  when  the  law  was  powerless, 
the  right  of  vengeance  was  accounted  a  positive  moral  duty,  and  the 
nearest  kinsman  of  the  slain  or  injured  was  bound  to  take  up  the 
quarrel ;  but  no  such  claim  was  advanced,  nor  was  any  attempt  to 
avenge  Sir  John  Stewart's  murder  made  either  by  his  brother  Walter, 
or  by  the  husbands  of  Sir  John's  daughters. 

Before  a  year,  however,  had  passed,  and  when  the  swords  of  Alan 
McCowle's  followers  had  failed  to  remove  the  obstacle  which  stood  be- 
tween him  and  his  brother's  inheritance,  we  find  Walter  profiting  by 
Dugald's  reverses  in  the  field,  and  his  omission  to  take  legal  procedure 
to  have  himself  served  heir  to  his  father,  to  advance  his  own  claims, 
under  the  plea  that  his  brother's  marriage  with  the  mother  of  Dugald 
had  not  been  duly  solemnised.  Any  one  acquainted  with  the  details 
of  Scotch  history  at  this  period  need  not  be  told  that  with  powerful  court 
influence  there  could  be  little  difficulty  in  effecting  this.  But  though  it 
was  easy  to  prefer  this  claim  in  Edinburgh,  where  Argyll's  influence 
was  all  powerful,  and  the  very  existence  of  Dugald  was  probably  known 
only  to  few,  Walter  could  not  venture  to  do  so  in  person  in  Lorn,  where 
ample  evidence  of  the  marriage  was  then  forthcoming,  and  conse- 
quently from  Lorn  Walter  then,  and  ever  after,  carefully  kept  aloof 

In  like  manner  had  Sir  John  Stewart's  daughters  been, — as  is 
alleged  in  the  family  histories  of  Lochow  and  Breadalbane,  but  which 
is  conclusively  disproved  by  the  charter  of  1452, — "the  heretrices  of 
Lome,"  it  would  have  been  the  duty  of  the  Campbells,  and,  indeed, 
not  a  very  arduous  one  when  the  power  of  Argyll  as  Justiciary  of  Scot- 


land  is  considered,  to  have  taken  measures  for  the  recovery  of  their 
heritage  from  the  murderer.  But,  as  we  have  seen,  no  such  steps  were 
taken,  and  the  duties  of  recovery  and  vengeance  devolved  upon  Dugald 
as  part  of  his  inheritance ;  for  it  does  not  appear  that  any  action  fol- 
lowed upon  the  recommendation  of  Parliament,  nine  months  later,  that 
the  king's  forces  should  avenge  the  murder  of  the  "king's  Cusyng."  It 
was  probably  inconsistent  with  the  plans  of  others  that  any  steps  should 
be  taken  on  this  minute. 

The  attitude  of  the  Campbells  is  perhaps  not  difficult  of  explana- 
tion when  read  by  the  light  of  subsequent  events.  It  seems  to  furnish 
a  striking  illustration  of  their  policy,  so  forcibly  described  by  Skene  in 
his  History  of  the  Highlanders.  In  1427  Sir  Colin  Campbell  of  Lochow 
had  succeeded  in  placing  himself  at  the  head  of  the  family,  and  in  sup- 
planting Campbell  of  Strachur,  whose  claims  to  that  position  had  been 
acknowledged  in  a  Royal  Charter  by  King  David  II.  "  After  this 
period  the  rise  of  the  Argyll  family  to  power  and  influence  was  rapid, 
and  the  encroachments  which  had  commenced  with  the  branches  of 
their  own  clan,  soon  involved  most  of  the  clans  in  the  neighbourhood. 
Their  history  is  most  remarkable,  from  their  extraordinary  progress 
from  a  station  of  comparative  inferiority  to  one  of  unusual  eminence,  as 
well  as  from  the  constant  and  steady  adherence  of  all  the  barons  of 
that  house  to  the  same  deep  system  of  designing  policy,  by  which  they 
attained  their  greatness.  It  consisted  principally  of  the  details  of  a 
policy  characterised  by  cunning  and  perfidy,  though  deep  and  far 
sighted,  and  which  obtained  its  usual  success  in  the  acquisition  of  great 
temporal  grandeur  and  power."  A  proof  of  their  adherence  to  this 
policy  was  given  in  1531,  when  the  Earl  of  Argj'll  was  disgraced  and  im- 
prisoned for  his  own  and  his  father's  sins  in  encouraging  the  disorders 
in  the  islands  so  as  to  profit  by  them. 

Sir  John  Stewart  himself  seems  to  have  foreseen  their  antagonism 
to  his  youthful  son  by  his  appointment  of  John  McCowle  as  his 
guardian. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  83 

Whatever  may  have  been  the  reasons  for  the  inaction  of  Walter 
and  the  Campbells,  it  was  undoubtedly  left  to  Dugald  to  avenge  his 
father's  murder,  and  for  this  purpose  he  at  once  ordered  a  muster  of  the 
followers  of  his  family  in  Lorn,  while  he  hastened  in  person  to  Strath- 
earn  and  Balquidder  to  raise  the  whole  clan  of  the  Maclarens. 

The  odds  against  him  were  indeed  heavy,  for  he  was  opposed  not 
only  by  open  foes  in  the  field,  consisting  of  a  numerous  section  of  the 
Macdougalls, — who,  with  their  followers,  were  still  a  powerful  clan  in 
Lorn, — backed  by  the  Earl  of  Ross,  but  by  secret  enemies  as  powerful, 
and,  in  reality,  still  more  dangerous.  Personally  entirely  unknown  in 
Lorn,  Dugald's  claims  to  the  succession  had  no  recommendation  save 
that  of  their  inherent  justice.  This,  however,  was  unhesitatingly 
acknowledged  by  the  clan,  and  was  sufficient  to  secure  him  uni- 
versal support  from  the  retainers  of  his  family ;  and,  sustained  by  the 
consciousness  that  "  thrice  armed  is  he  who  hath  his  quarrel  just," 
Dugald  at  once  took  the  field,  marching,  himself,  with  the  Maclarens 
through  Glendochart  and  Strathfillan  to  Leac-a-dotha,  on  the  skirts  of 
Bendoran,  at  the  head  of  Loch  Awe,  having  been  joined  by  his  father's 
retainers  and  followers  from  Lorn,  whose  route  had  lain  through  Glencoe 
and  the  Black  Mount.  He  would  thus,  within  ten  days  of  his  father's 
death,  have  finally  crushed  Alane  Macdougall  and  his  adherents,  had 
not  the  latter  been  reinforced  by  the  MacFarlanes  from  Loch  Lomond. 

The  traditions  of  the  Stewarts  and  Maclarens  combine  to  relate  that 
this  assistance  was  rendered  at  the  instance  of  the  Campbells;  but  whether 
this  be  true  or  not,  it  is  certain  that  the  MacFarlanes  were  at  this  time 
closely  allied  with  the  Campbells.  Duncan  MacFarlane,  the  sixth  chief, 
had  married  Christian,  daughter  of  Sir  Duncan  Campbell  of  Lochow,  aunt 
of  Glenorchy,  and  grand-aunt  of  Argyll  ;  and  from  their  dwelling  inland 
on  the  banks  of  Loch  Lomond,  and  their  connection  at  that  time  with 
the  family  of  Dernely,  they  were  not  likely  to  have  any  share  in  the 
rebellion  of  the  Earl  of  Ross.  The  MacFarlanes,  arriving  from  Loch- 
lomondside,   joined    the    Macdougalls    near    Dalmally,    whence    they 


marched  northwards  through  the  glen  leading  to  the  Bridge  of  Orchy, 
near  Leac-a-dotha.  A  battle  ensued  in  which  Dugald  was  worsted.  The 
engagement  must  have  been  a  bloody  one,  more  than  one  hundred  and 
thirty  of  the  Maclarens  having  been  killed,  while  among  the  Stewarts  it 
is  said  there  were  no  less  than  fifty  slain,  whose  widows  bore  posthum- 
ous sons.  On  the  side  of  their  opponents  a  son  of  Alane  M'Cowle  fell, 
and  the  losses  of  that  clan  were  so  great  that  they  were  never  subse- 
quently so  numerous  in  Argyllshire.  The  chief  of  the  MacFarlanes 
was  also  killed,  under  circumstances  which  show  the  relentless  nature 
of  the  conflict  which  had  been  waged,  and  prove  that  the  sentiments 
of  chivalry  had  not  as  yet  influenced  the  contests  in  the  Highlands. 
A  wounded  Maclaren  had  asked  the  MacFarlane  to  give  him  in  his 
shoe  a  drink  from  a  well  close  at  hand,  and  as  the  chief  was  stooping 
down  to  fill  the  shoe,  the  wounded  man  drew  his  bow  and  sent  an  arrow 
through  his  back.  MacFarlane  put  his  hand  behind  him  to  feel  for  the 
arrow,  when  the  dying  Maclaren,  exulting  in  the  penetration  of  his  shaft, 
called  out,  "  Search  in  front  of  you,  and  you  will  find  it." 

After  this  bloody  battle,  Dugald  retreated  with  the  remainder  of 
his  forces  behind  Loch  Etive  into  Upper  Lorn  or  Appin  ;  and  though 
apparently  he  was  unable  to  invade  Middle  Lorn  in  force,  and  risk 
another  pitched  battle,  he  continued  unflinchingly  and  successfully 
to  maintain  his  right  of  possession  until  the  compromise  in  1649,  the 
particulars  of  which  will  hereafter  appear. 

Meanwhile  his  uncle,  Walter,  had  not  ventured  to  take  any  steps 
in  Argyllshire  towards  assuming  possession  of  that  magnificent  heritage 
of  Lorn,  to  which  he  had  so  tardily  laid  claim  in  Edinburgh.  Walter 
had  no  doubt  been  looked  upon  in  the  capital  for  years  as  heir  pre- 
sumptive to  his  brother's  titles  and  estates,  and  as  the  knowledge  of  his 
brother's  marriage  was  probably  confined  to  the  district  of  Argyll,  there 
was  no  one  to  prevent  his  assuming  the  title,  though  it  is  certain  he 
could  not,  and  did  not,  until  the  surrender  by  Dugald  five  years  after- 
wards, take  sasine  of  Lorn.     Those  retainers  of  the  family  of  Stewart 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  85 

who  Still  remained  in  Lorn,  had  become  indignant  at  the  ungenerous  part 
which  Walter  had  so  long  been  playing  towards  his  youthful  kinsman, 
the  head  of  his  family,  and  at  his  subserviency  to  the  Campbells,  to 
whom  they  alleged  their  rights  were  being  sacrificed ;  and  they  now 
made  the  exodus  known  in  Lorn  as  the  "  Inveich  mor,"  or  "great  flit- 
ting," from  the  southern  portion  of  Lorn  to  Upper  Lorn,  or  Appin,  fol- 
lowing the  fortunes  of  Dugald  as  chief  of  the  clan.  Thus  reinforced, 
Dugald,  the  Maclarens  again  aiding  him,  was  able  to  defeat  decisively 
an  attack,  very  probably  the  result  of  the  "  Inveich  Mor,"  made 
upon  him  by  the  whole  strength  of  his  enemies  in  the  hope  of  at  last 
driving  him  out  of  Lorn.  The  battle,  called  the  battle  of  Stale,  took 
place  opposite  to  Castle  Stalcaire,  on  the  green  hillside  near  where  the 
village  of  Portnacroish  now  stands.  Castle  Stalcaire,  an  old  hunting- 
seat  of  the  lords  of  Lorn,  and,  occupying  an  insular  position — then 
considered  a  strong  one, — was  probably  Dugald's  chief  stronghold  in 
Upper  Lorn.  In  the  battle,  Alane  Macdougall,  the  murderer  of  Sir 
John  Stewart  of  Lorn,  and  the  leader  of  the  insurrection  amongst  the 
Macdougalls,  was  killed. 

Dugald  having  now  avenged  his  father's  death,  and  being,  for  the 
first  time  after  five  years'  strife,  victorious  in  a  general  engagement, 
directed  his  attention  to  the  consolidation  of  that  hold  on  his  inherit- 
ance which  he  had  never  relaxed. 

From  the  circumstances  of  his  early  life  in  the  seclusion  of 
Ardveich,  he  was  probably  too  ignorant  of  forms  of  law  to  know  that 
anything  more  than  his  sword  was  necessary  to  give  him  possession  of 
his  father's  land,  which  it  would  seem  to  him  became  his  property  as 
simply  as  his  father's  horse  or  his  armour ;  and  since  his  succession  he 
had  been  too  busily  engaged  in  seeking  the  customary,  and  what  was 
held  the  sacred  duty  of  vengeance  for  his  father's  death,  and  in  main- 
taining himself  in  that  upper  district  of  Lorn,  beyond  which  he  was  in 
the  middle  of  enemies  seeking  his  life,  to  have  had  either  leisure  or 
opportunity  for  other  considerations.     To  whom  could  he  now  turn  for 


86  THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 

help  ?  James  III.  was  a  minor,  and  it  seemed  in  vain  to  look  to  him, 
at  whose  distracted  court  Argyll,  from  his  high  office  and  great  abilities, 
had  almost  unbounded  influence,  for  that  aid  and  countenance,  after- 
wards so  freely  given  by  succeeding  sovereigns  to  his  sons,  Duncan  and 
Alan.  The  Crown  indeed  was  hardly  able  at  that  time  to  maintain  its 
own  rights,  or  enforce  its  own  laws  in  districts  much  less  remote  than 
Lorn,  which  in  fact  was  under  no  law.  Till  1503,  when  they  were 
attached  to  "the  Courts  of  Justice-airs"  to  be  held  at  Perth,  the 
"  inhabitants  of  Dowart,  Glentowart,  and  the  Lordship  of  Lorn  "  could 
not  be  called  upon  to  attend  any  courts  of  justice,  and  each  chief  ruled 
despotically,  and  without  responsibility  to  any  external  law,  within  his 
own  heritable  jurisdiction.  Being  thus  hopeless  of  obtaining  assistance 
from  the  Crown  against  his  open  or  secret  enemies,  the  chief  at  length 
became  aware  that  it  was  in  vain  for  him  to  attempt  to  regain  and 
keep  permanent  possession  of  the  whole  lands  of  Lorn  in  the  face  of 
such  powerful  adversaries.  It  was  then,  and  not  till  then,  that  he  enter- 
tained the  thought,  or  probably  the  proposal,  of  a  compromise  by 
which  he  should  retain  Appin,  the  northern  portion  of  Lorn,  which  he 
had  so  long  and  so  gallantly  defended,  making  over  the  remainder  of 
the  estates  to  his  uncle  Walter,  In  consequence  of  this  surrender  by 
Dugald,  Walter,  who  had  never  dared  to  show  his  face  in  Lorn,  was 
now,  in  1469,  able  formally  to  enter  upon  the  southern  portion  of  the 
lordship,  and  upon  the  barony  of  Innermeath. 

It  was  therefore  more  than  five  years  after  his  brother's  death,  and 
after  a  compromise  which  the  force  of  circumstances  and  the  death  of  so 
many  of  his  friends  in  battle,  had  compelled  his  nephew  to  make,  that 
Walter  Stewart  was  able,  in  the  face  of  his  brother's  deed  of  1452,  be- 
queathing Lorn  and  Innermeath  to  the  heirs  male  of  his  body,  to  enter 
to  these  baronies.  The  compromise  must  have  been  completed  in  the 
summer  or  autumn  of  1469,  as  on  the  30th  November  of  that  year 
Walter  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Earl  of  Argyll,  and  the  fol- 
lowing day  gave  the  Earl  a  bond  that  he  would  enter  upon  Lorn  for  the 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


purpose  of  resigning  it  in  the  Earl's  favour,  under  a  penalty  of  6000 
merks  Scots.  On  the  28th  March  1470,  more  than  six  years  after  his 
brother's  death,  Walter  at  last  took  seisin  "  be  yerde  and  stane  "  by  his 
procurator,  from  Alan  Stewart,  Sheriff  of  Perth,  of  the  lands  of  Lorn. 
On  the  13th  April  1470,  Walter  gave  a  bond  to  the  Earl  of  Argyll  that 
he  would  not  dispute  the  resignation  of  Lorn  at  any  future  period, 
under  a  penalty  of  6000  merks  Scots,  and  on  the  following  day  he  re- 
signed the  lands  and  lordship  into  the  hands  of  King  James  IIL,  who 
three  days  afterwards,  on  the  17th  April  1470,  granted  them  to  the 
Earl  of  Argyll.  Thus  the  Earl  fortified  the  deed  of  resignation  in  his 
favour  by  all  the  formalities  that  bonds  could  give  him,  and  indeed  by 
precautions  somewhat  unusual.  This  notable  attention  to  every  form 
of  business  contrasts  very  strongly  with  the  delay  of  more  than  six 
years  in  Walter's  going  through  the  formality  of  being  seized  in  what  he 
now  claimed  as  inheriting  from  his  brother,  and  gives  strong  evidence 
that,  previous  to  this  time,  an  insurmountable  obstacle  had  stood  in  the 
way,  and  that  it  had  been  removed  by  the  compromise  with  Sir  John 
Stewart's  only  son,  Dugald.  This  delay  is  the  stronger  evidence  that 
Sir  John's  disposition  of  his  property  was  known  in  Edinburgh,  as  it 
appears  that  his  two  surviving  daughters,  and  Campbell  of  Glenorchy, 
as  heir  of  Margaret  the  eldest,  took  sasine  of  their  portions,  the  lands  of 
Dollar  and  Gloum,  little  more  than  a  year  after  their  father's  death. 
Their  rights  to  these  estates  were  unquestioned,  as  they  were  not 
included  in  the  eatail  upon  male  heirs  of  1452,  and  they  had  either  been 
settled  on  them  at  their  marriage  or  purposely  excluded  from  that 
entail  with  this  view.  When  we  notice  the  praiseworthy  attention  to 
business  evinced  in  thus  promptly  taking  sasine  of  the  lands  in  Clack- 
mannan, we  may  dismiss  without  further  criticism  the  statements 
of  Maister  William  Bowie,  and  the  equally  inventive  historian  of  the 
House  of  Argyll,  that  Sir  John  Stewart's  three  daughters  were 
"heretrices  of  Lorn." 

That  the  contents,  as  well  as  the  incontrovertibility  of  the  charter 


of  1452,  were  as  well  known  to  Walter  Stewart  as  to  the  Campbells, 
may  be  unhesitatingly  inferred  from  the  fact  that  Walter  was  unable 
to  take  sasine  of  Lorn  until  after  Dugald's  surrender  in  1469. 

Walter  seems  to  have  been  a  weak  man,  and  in  that  year  Colin, 
Earl  of  Argyll,  who  was  able,  active,  and  ambitious,  saw  his  opportunity 
in  the  exhaustion  of  Dugald  and  the  Macdougalls,  and  in  the  feeble 
character  of  Walter,  to  acquire  possession  of  the  coveted  province  of 
Lorn,  and  of  the  great  opportunity  in  the  power  of  its  possessor  to 
exercise  influence  on  the  islanders,  an  opportunity  which  in  after  years 
was  not  neglected. 

The  earl,  therefore,  induced  Walter  to  enter  upon  an  agreement 
by  which  the  latter  retained  or  obtained  possession  of  the  barony  of 
Innermeath,  situated  in  a  comparatively  peaceful  district,  while  the 
possession  of  the  lordship  of  Lorn  made  Argyll  the  most  powerful 
chieftain  in  the  West  Highlands,  and  enabled  him, — though  but  a  cadet 
of  the  family,  and,  as  the  Black  Book  of  Taymouth  informs  us,  the 
descendant  of  "  Duncan  Campbell,  commonly  callit  Duncan  in  Aa," — 
effectually  to  gratify  his  ambition  by  eclipsing  his  chief,  Campbell  of 
Strachur,  and  by  appearing  before  the  world  as  the  head  of  the  Campbells. 

It  was  only  decent  to  make  an  enumeration  of  the  lands  given  in 
exchange  for  this  great  lordship,  and  accordingly  we  find  Innerdonyng, 
Baldonyng,  Kildonyng,  Colindrane,  Maw,  Colcarney,  Balnaguone,  Lai- 
doth,  Laithers,  and  Rothybrisbane,  named  as  the  equivalent  given  by 
Argyll.  With  the  exception  of  the  four  last  named,  however,  all  these 
lands  were  enumerated  in  the  charter  of  1452,  as  being  incorporated  by 
royal  authority  into  the  barony  of  Innermeath,  and  by  the  charter  of 
the  same  date,  John  Stewart  of  Lorn  had  destined  that  barony,  together 
with  Lorn,  to  his  heirs-male  exclusively.  They  could  not,  therefore, 
have  been  Argyll's  to  give,  and  their  mention  can  only  be  taken  as 
a  colourable  pretext.  The  agreement  of  1469  then  goes  on  to  stipulate 
that  Walter  should  enter  upon  the  lands  of  Lorn  for  the  purpose  of 
resigning  them  to   the   Earl,  an  arrangement  which   could  be  easily 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  89 

carried  out  through  Argj'll's  great  influence  at  the  court  of  the  youthful 
James  III. 

But  we  can  hardly  suppose  that  even  Walter's  weakness  would 
have  led  him  to  surrender  this  princely  inheritance,  had  he  for  one 
moment  believed  that  he  would  be  permitted  to  take  possession  of 
Lorn,  where  the  facts  of  Dugald's  legitimation  were  known,  and  where 
he  had  met  with  such  universal  and  effectual  support  from  the  friends 
and  retainers  of  the  family,  who  had  recognised  him  as  their  chief. 
Walter,  therefore,  had  probably  little  real  choice  in  the  matter,  and  was, 
perhaps,  too  glad  to  surrender  a  title  and  an  estate  which  he  well  knew 
he  could  never  retain  in  peace. 

Dugald,  on  the  other  hand,  brought  up  in  a  remote  glen  in  Strath- 
earn,  was,  as  was  almost  inevitable  from  the  circumstances  of  his  birth, 
ignorant  of  the  forms  of  procedure  necessary  for  establishing  his  rights. 
Exhausted  by  five  years  of  strife,  and  with  Argyll's  overwhelming  forces 
in  the  background,  he,  too,  probably  found  that  he  could  do  no  better 
than  compromise  his  right  to  the  whole  of  Lorn  for  the  district  of 
Appin  or  Upper  Lorn. 

His  tenure  of  these  lands,  independendy  of  his  possession  of  them, 
requires  especial  notice.  If  Walter  and  Argyll  had  not  been  aware  of 
the  justice  of  his  claims,  it  is  inconceivable  that  he  should  have  been 
permitted  to  retain,  blench  of  the  Crown,  so  large  a  territory  as  Appin, 
one  so  easily  defensible,  and  when  in  the  possession  of  an  enemy, 
from  its  situation,  so  dangerous  to  Lorn.  Indeed,  Argyll  endeavoured 
to  avert  this  danger  by  giving  his  kinsman  of  Glenorchy  a  strip  of 
land  between  Dugald's  possessions  and  his  own  portion  of  Lorn.  This 
however,  as  will  be  seen,  Glenorchy  was  afterwards  compelled  by 
James  IV.  to  surrender  to  Dugald's  son.  Had  Dugald's  claim  been 
unfounded,  any  land  that  might  have  been  given  him — and  it  is  not  at  all 
likely  that  he  would,  under  these  circumstances,  have  got  any  territory 
whatever — would  have  been  held  by  him  from  Walter,  and  then  from 
Argyll,  as  his  superior.     But  as  a  Crown  vassal   he  held  a  widely 

M

different  position,  for  besides  being  then — as  was  each  of  his  successors 
afterwards, — the  universally  recognised  head  of  the  Stewarts  of  Lorn,  he 
was  a  baron  of  parliament,  acknowledging  no  superior  save  the  king, 
and  exercising  unchallenged  jurisdiction  within  the  limits  of  his  own 
barony. 

To  ensure  the  acquiescence  and  support  of  his  powerful  kinsman 
of  Glenorchy,  Argyll  gave  him  a  large  district  of  Lorn  in  exchange  for 
his  mother,  Jonet  Stewart's  dowry  of  the  third  part  of  the  lands  of 
Dollar,  which  were  of  less  value,  and  were  situated  far  from  Glenorchy's 
paternal  domain,  while  those  he  received  in  Lorn  were  adjacent  to  his 
own  strong  and  recently-built  castle  of  Kilchurn.  Having  now  acquired 
possession  of  Lorn, — excepting  the  district  of  Appin  held  "  in  heritage  " 
by  Dugald  Stewart, — and  of  two-thirds  of  Dollar  and  Gloum,  Argyll  got 
from  the  Bishop  of  Dunkeld,  the  superior  of  Dollar,  a  charter  dated 
31st  January  1493-4,  which  was  confirmed  by  James  IV.  at  Stirling,  on 
nth  May  1497,  of  the  remaining  third  part  of  these  lands  which  had 
been  the  portion  of  his  wife's  younger  sister  Marion,  the  wife  of  Arthur 
Campbell  of  Ottar.  These,  doubtless,  are  the  "  many  actions  "  which 
the  family  chronicler  of  the  Argylls  says  that  the  first  earl  brought  to 
his  house,  and  were  not  unworthy  of  the  policy  which  that  family  has 
always  steadily  pursued,  and  which  Mr  Bowie  enforces  in  the  family 
maxim,  "  Conquer,  or  keep  things  conquest."  The  term  conquer  is  used 
by  Mr  Bowie  in  its  old  legal  signification  of  "acquire." 

If  any  doubt  existed  as  to  the  real  nature  of  these  complicated 
transactions,  it  would  be  removed  by  the  admissions  of  the  author  of  the 
MSS.  in  the  British  Museum,  who  confesses  that  Argyll  was  "  in  end 
compelled  to  give  the  Stewarts  satisfaction,"  as  well  as  "  likeways  to 
satisfy  "  the  Macdougalls,  M'Oneil  of  Brue,  and  the  Laird  of  Reray. 
This  final  clause  of  the  sentence  apparently  implies  a  more  serious 
charge  against  Argyll,  into  which  it  is  beyond  the  province  of  this 
work  to  enter.  It  would  seem,  however,  that  the  Macdougalls  were 
not  allowed  to  retain  all  the  "  satisfaction  "  they  received,  as  we  find,  in 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  91 

1478,  Alan  Sorlesone  M'Cowle  suing  the  Earl  for  warrandice  of  the 
lands  of  Lerage  and  Wouchkouch,  in  terms  of  the  Earl's  charter,  as 
Duncan  and  Dugall  Campbell  claimed  a  lease  thereof,  and,  as  might  be 
expected,  a  "Icinless  loon,"  like  Alane  M'Coule,  was  defeated.  Neither 
does  the  Earl  seem  to  have  recognised  the  right  of  the  head  of  the  Mac- 
dougalls  to  the  office  of  Bailie  of  Lorn,  with  the  lucrative  and  honour- 
able privileges  attached  to  it,  which  had  been  conferred  by  Sir  John 
Stewart  of  Lorn.  Argyll  was  unquestionably  indebted  for  his  acquisi- 
tion of  Lorn,  to  the  fact  that  he  had  to  deal  with  two  antagonists — one 
of  whom  played  into  his  hand.  His  own  claim  was  of  course  completely 
barred  by  the  charter  of  1452,  while  the  circumstances  of  Sir  John  of 
Lorn's  second  marriage,  followed  by  his  death  before  further  steps  could 
be  taken  to  make  his  son  Dugald's  legitimation  more  widely  known, 
gave  Walter  Stewart  the  opportunity  of  advancing  a  claim.  These 
pretensions  had  not  been  put  forward  at  Sir  John  Stewart's  death,  when 
it  had  been  left  to  Dugald  to  avenge  his  father's  murder,  and  they  only 
seem  to  have  been  advanced  after  his  failure  to  eject  the  intruders  from 
Lorn  south  of  Loch  Etive,  and  when  it  became  evident  he  was  too 
ignorant,  and  too  inexperienced  in  the  ways  of  the  world,  to  be  aware  of 
the  necessity  of  taking  legal  steps  to  secure  his  inheritance. 

Dugald's  enforced  compromise  at  once  placed  his  uncle  Walter,  as 
next  in  remainder,  in  a  position  to  enter  upon  the  southern  portion  of 
Lorn,  and  the  barony  of  Innermeath.  Crawford  says,  and  Duncan 
Stewart  repeats,  though  expressly  only  on  the  authority  of  Crawford, 
that  at  this  time  Dugald  entered  into  an  agreement  with  his  sisters,  and 
that  the  deed  was  preserved  in  the  Argyll  charter  chest.  We  have  only 
Crawford's  authority  for  this  statement,  and  it  is  certain  that  neither  in 
the  "  Origines  Parochiales  Scotiae,"  the  author  of  which  had  access  to  the 
Argyll  archives,  nor  in  the  "  Reports  on  the  Argyll  Papers,"  by  Mr  W. 
Eraser,  which  are  printed  in  the  Fourth  and  Sixth  Reports  to  the  Royal 
Commission  on  Historical  MSS.,  is  there  any  reference  to  such  an  agree- 
ment, though  they  contain  many  of  infinitely  less  importance.    It  is  there- 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


fore  probable  that  the  agreement  mentioned  by  Crawford  was  Walter 
Stewart's  subsequent  agreement  with  Argyll. 

The  part  of  Lorn  which  Dugald  retained  formed  a  portion  of  the 
lordship  resigned  by  Robert  Stewart,  husband  of  Jonet,  heiress  of 
Lorn,  in  favour  of  his  brother  John,  and  Dugald  could  have  no  claim  to 
hold  it  blench  of  the  king,  except  by  the  same  right  by  which  he  claimed 
the  whole  of  Lorn.  Appin  had  formerly  belonged  to  the  great  Colum- 
ban  monastery  of  Lismore,  and  the  name  of  Abthania,  or  abbey  lands, 
was  corrupted  into  Apthane,  when  it  was  resigned  by  Robert  Stewart, 
and  then  into  Appine  or  Apine,  and  finally  into  Appin. 

Immediately  after  Walter  was  seized  in  the  southern  portion  of 
Lorn  on  the  21st  March  1469,  the  division  of  the  estates  took  place, 
Walter  retaining  Innermeath,  and  making  over  Lorn  to  Argyll,  who 
gave  Campbell  of  Glenorchy  his  share,  though,  so  far  as  we  can  dis- 
cover, Campbell  of  Ottar  got  no  part  of  the  lands.  Crawford  calls  this 
an  "  exchange"  by  Walter  of  Lorn  for  Innermeath,  but,  as  has  already 
been  made  abundantly  clear  by  the  charter  of  1452,  Innermeath  and 
Lorn  were  destined  to  the  same  male  heir,  whoever  he  might  be.  The 
indenture  of  30th  November  1469,  enumerating  the  lands  given  in 
exchange,  only  names  four — Balnaguone,  Laidloith,  Rothiebrisbane,  and 
Laithers,  which  were  not  incorporated  into  the  barony  of  Innermeath 
by  the  minor  charter  of  1452  ;  and  to  speak  of  giving  such  a  paltry  equi- 
valent as  these  "  in  exchange  "  for  the  lordship  of  Lorn,  for  centuries  an 
independent  principality,  and  one  of  the  noblest  heritages  in  Britain,  is 
to  state  a  proposition  which  is  absolutely  ridiculous. 

The  other  lands  mentioned  as  given  in  this  pretended  exchange— 
Baldonyng,  Innerdonyng,  and  Kildonyng  in  the  sheriffdom  of  Perth, 
Colindrane  and  Maw  in  Fife,  and  Calcarny  in  Kinross  were  all  men- 
tioned in  the  charter  of  1452  as  being  incorporated  into  the  barony  of 
Innermeath.  Had  Lady  Campbell  of  Glenorchy,  or  her  younger  sister 
the  Countess  of  Argyll,  inherited  from  their  father  the  whole  or  a 
third  part  of  the  lordship  of  Innermeath,  a  barony  not  only  important 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


in  itself,  but  so  largely  augmented  by  the  incorporation  of  these  lands, 
and  the  historical  barony  of  Redcastle  in  Forfarshire,  and  thus  being 
heretrices  of  estates  of  infinitely  greater  value  and  extent  than  the 
Clackmannanshire  lands,  there  can  be  no  doubt  whatever  that  Lady 
Campbell's  son  Duncan,  and  "  Dame  Isabell  Stewart,"  would  have  been 
seized  in  their  rich  inheritance  in  April  1465,  when  they  received  sasine 
of  the  lands  of  Castle  Gloum  and  Dollar,  the  record  of  which  has  been 
so  carefully  preserved.  But  as  it  appears  that  neither  the  Argyll 
Charter  Chest  nor  the  Taymouth  Register  contains  any  such  documents, 
while  the  records  of  the  small  grants  of  land  in  Argyllshire  on  the 
marriage  of  the  eldest  daughter,  and  the  sasines  of  their  real  inheritance 
in  Clackmannan,  have  been  so  carefully  kept,  the  conclusion  is 
inevitable  that  the  whole  transactions  were  simply  the  division  of 
the  spoils  of  a  lad,  spirited  and  gallant  enough,  but  nearly  friendless, 
and  ignorant  of  the  ways  of  the  world.  It  is  a  significant  circum- 
stance, and  one  which  can  hardly  be  the  result  of  accident,  that  neither 
in  the  family  of  Appin  nor  even  among  his  own  immediate  descendants 
of  Innermeath  does  the  name  of  Walter,  50  long  dear  as  that  of  their 
most  renowned  ancestors  in  Scotland,  ever  once  thereafter  appear. 

On  the  1st  December  1469,  Walter,  "Lord  Lorn,"  granted  to  the 
Earl  of  Argyll  the  bond  that  he  would  immediately  enter  upon  Lorn, 
and  thereafter  resign  the  title  and  the  lands  for  a  new  grant  to  the  Earl, 
who  in  turn  obliged  himself  to  obtain  from  the  King  for  Walter  the 
title  of  Lord  Innermeath,  with  precedence  over  that  of  Lorn ;  giving 
a  striking  proof  of  the  weakness  of  the  Crown,  when  one  subject 
could  thus  undertake  to  procure  a  title  of  honour  for  another.  In  fact 
it  is  probable  that  the  Earl,  from  his  influential  position  as  Justiciar  of 
Scotland,  had  been  able  to  secure  in  advance  the  sanction  of  the  youthful 
King  to  this  evidently  long-planned  arrangement,  for  we  find  a  bond  on 
the  13th  April  1470,  by  Walter  Stewart,  "  Lord  Innermeath,"  never  to 
dispute  the  preceding  resignation  under  a  penalty  of  6000  merks— and  on 
the  next  day  Walter  completed  the  resignation  of  the  lands  and  title  to 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


the  King,  who  three  days  after  granted  them  to  the  Earl  of  Argyll,  to 
be  held  blench  of  the  King  on  the  rendering  of  a  mantle  at  Whitsun- 
day, if  required. 

The  Earl  then  proceeded  to  apportion  to  his  kinsman  of  Glen- 
orchy  his  share  of  the  acquired  lands,  making  over  to  him  one-third  of 
Lorn,  which  included  a  third  of  Lismore  and  a  belt  of  land  in  Appin 
lying  on  the  north  shore  of  Loch  Creran,  both  of  which,  however.  King 
James  IV.  subsequently  compelled  Sir  Duncan  Campbell  of  Glenorchy 
to  restore  to  Duncan  Stewart  of  Appin,  Dugald's  eldest  son  and 
successor. 

Argyll's  seal  to  the  charter  to  Campbell  of  Glenorchy  of  these 
lands  in  1470,  is  thus  described  by  Laing :  "  Couch^,  gyronny  of  eight. 
Crest,  on  a  helmet  a  boar's  head  with  neck  couped.  Supporters,  two 
lions  rampant,  the  background  ornamented  with  foliage."  It  therefore 
appears  plainly  that  the  quartering  of  the  galley  of  Lorn  on  the  paternal 
achievement  of  Argyll,  "  in  consequence  "  of  his  marriage,  did  not  only 
not  take  place  on  his  marriage,  nor  even  upon  his  succession  to  his 
wife's  inheritance,  at  the  death  of  her  father  in  1463,  but  that  it  had  not 
even  been  assumed  in  1470.  Dugald  Stewart  and  his  descendants  alone 
continued  to  bear  what  Laing  calls  "the  noble  coat  of  the  Stewarts  of 
Lorn,"  and  though  it  was  partly  borne  by  the  Stewarts  of  Innermeath, 
the  supporters  of  this  junior  branch  were  changed  from  roebucks  to 
fallow-deer,  and  the  crest  of  a  unicorn's  head  to  a  deer's  head,  as  may 
be  seen  in  Workman's  "  Book  of  Blazons,"  compiled  about  1550,  and  in 
another  Book  of  Blazons,  apparently  compiled  a  little  later,  amongst 
the  MSS.  in  the  British  Museum. 

Though  Dugald  Stewart,  by  the  enforced  compromise,  gave  up  to  his 
uncle  the  lordship  of  Lorn,  his  descendants  were  recognised  as  re- 
presenting the  noble  house  of  the  Stewarts  of  Lorn.  Sir  David 
Lindsay  of  the  Mount,  "  Lord  Lyon  King  at  Arms,"  was  the  most 
celebrated  Scots  genealogist  and  herald  of  his  day,  and  would  be 
punctilious  in  giving  men  of  family  their  proper  designation.     As  has 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


been  already  mentioned,  it  has  always  been  one  of  the  duties  of  the 
Lyon  King  at  Arms,  and,  indeed,  it  has  been  specially  defined  as  such 
under  the  Statutes  of  1592  and  1672,  "to  record  the  genealogies  of 
persons  descended  from  noble  and  honourable  lineage  when  supported 
by  proper  evidence."  Sir  David  was  born  in  1490,  twenty  years  after 
the  Stewarts  of  Innermeath  had  divested  themselves,  in  favour  of 
another,  of  any  title  they  had  to  be  called  Stewarts  of  Lorn.  Forty- 
one  years  later,  about  1531,  Sir  David  wrote  his  poem  called  "The 
Complaynt  of  the  Papingo,"  and  in  the  "  Prolog  "  he  mentions  amongst 
the  poets  of  his  time  William  Stewart,  and  "  Stewart  of  Lorn"  who  "will 
carpe  richt  curiouslie."  The  poem  containing  a  sarcastic  eulogy  on  the 
liberality  of  James  V.,  who  is  well  known  to  have  been  penurious,  and 
of  his  courtiers,  entitled  "  Lergess,  Lergess  hay,  Lergess  of  this  New 
Year's  day,"  is  that  written  by  Stewart  of  Lorn,  and  alluded  to  by  Sir 
David  as  "  carping  richt  curiouslie." 

James  V.  was  then  nineteen  years  old,  so  that  the  poem  must  have 
been  written  shortly  before  that  time,  or  sixty  years  after  the  Inner- 
meath family  had  relinquished  that  claim  to  Lorn  which  Dugald,  and 
his  sons  Duncan  and  Alan,  had  still  maintained.  The  poem  begins, 
"  First  Lergess  of  the  King,  my  Chief,"  pretty  clearly  showing  the 
writer's  Highland  origin.  "  Stewart  of  Lome,"  so  called  by  Sir  David 
Lindsay,  seems  to  have  been  Alan,  Dugald's  second  son,  who  was  in 
high  favour  with  James  V.,  as  his  brother  had  been  with  James  IV., 
and  in  a  charter  was  designed  by  the  King,  "  consanguineus  dilectus," 
dear  blood  relative.  Afterwards,  in  the  reign  of  James  VI.,  in  an  Act 
of  the  Scots  Parliament,  dated  1587,  the  head  of  the  clan  was  designed 
Stewart  "  of  Lorn,  or  of  Appin ;"  and  in  1 800,  when  the  eldest  branch  of 
the  Stewarts  of  Appin  had  become  extinct,  the  Lyon  King  at  Arms 
recognised,  in  his  official  declaration,  the  head  of  the  family  of  Ardsheal 
as  the  representative  of  the  "  Stewarts  of  Lorn,  Appin,  and  Ardsheal." 

After  the  compromise  above  narrated,  Dugald  Stewart  seems  to 
have  held  his  lands  of  Appin  without  molestation,  and  in  1497,  or  1498, 


96  THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 

we  find  him  leading  out  his  followers  to  the  aid  of  his  trusty  allies, 
the  Maclarens.  This  clan  had  made  a  foray  into  the  lands  of  the 
M 'Donalds  of  Keppoch,  who  had  turned  out  in  force  to  ravage 
Balquidder  in  reprisal.  The  Maclarens  calling  the  Appin  men  to  their 
assistance,  met  the  M' Donalds  about  the  head  of  Glenorchy,  and  in  the 
battle  which  ensued  Dugald  was  killed,  but  not  till  Donald  of  Keppoch, 
elder  brother  of  Alaster  M 'Angus,  had  fallen  under  his  sword. 

Dugald  Stewart  married  a  daughter  of  ■  Macdougall  of  Nether 
Lorn,  a  marriage  which  was  probably  arranged  soon  after  the 
compromise  of  1469  to  stop  the  blood  feud  which  would  otherwise 
have  continued  between  these  two  neighbouring  families  for  years  with 
intense  inveteracy.     He  left  three  sons — 

1.  Duncan,  his  successor. 

2.  Alan,  who  succeeded  Duncan. 

3.  Robert,  who  died  without  legitimate  issue. 

Duncan  Stewart,  eldest  son  of  Dugald  Stewart,  first  of  Appin, 
succeeded  his  father  in  the  ^40  land  of  Appin  on  his  death  in  1497. 
At  this  time  the  Western  Highlands  and  Islands  were  much  disturbed  by 
the  attempts  of  the  representatives  of  the  old  Lords  of  the  Isles  to  revive 
their  pretensions  to  independent  power.  James  IV.,  who  was  born  in 
1473,  and  succeeded  his  father  in  1488,  made  frequent  journeys  to  the 
West  Highlands,  and  thus  became  acquainted  with  Duncan  of  Appin, 
who  was  a  bold  and  energetic  man.  The  King  recognised  him  as  his 
kinsman,  appointed  him  to  the  office  of  King's  Chamberlain  of  the 
Isles,  and  bestowed  on  him  large  grants  of  lands,  which  will  be 
enumerated  hereafter. 

The  King  also  compelled  Sir  Duncan  Campbell  of  Glenorchy  to 
restore  to  Duncan  Stewart  the  third  part  of  Appin,  and  the  lands  in 
Lismore  which  Glenorchy's  father,  Sir  Colin,  had  received  out  of  the 
inheritance  of  Dugald,  only  son  of  Sir  John  Stewart,  Lord  of  Lorn. 
It  was  hardly  possible  for  King  James  to  compel  the  restoration  of  the 
whole  of  Lorn  to  Duncan,  as  the  two  families  of  Argyll  and  Glenorchy 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


had  held  the  lordship  for  nearly  thirty  years  under  the  sanction  of 
James  III.  and  his  Parliament,  nor  could  he  restore  to  him  the  title  of 
Lord  Lorn,  for  as  Lord  Hailes,  whose  authority  on  such  a  point  can 
hardly  be  disputed,  has  pointed  out,  the  possession  of  the  comitatus 
carried  with  it  the  title.  But  by  his  grant  to  Duncan  of  a  territory 
which  extended  from  Loch  Creran  on  the  south  to  Inverlochy  on  the 
north,  the  Sovereign  apparently  desired  to  recompense  his  kinsman  for 
the  loss  of  Lorn  without  dispossessing  the  now  powerful  family  of 
Argyll ;  and  by  giving  him  possession  of  a  domain  nearly  equivalent  in 
value,  as  well  as  by  appointing  him  to  this  high  office  in  the  Western 
Highlands,  the  King  thus  placed  Duncan  in  a  position  of  dignity 
resembling  that  of  his  forefathers.  As  will  appear  from  the  charters 
hereafter  quoted,  Duncan  had  now  the  whole  of  Appin,  except,  perhaps, 
the  lands  of  Airds,  which,  so  far  as  can  be  ascertained,  never  formed 
part  of  the  Stewart  lands,  a  small  rivulet  called  Con  Ruagh  constitut- 
ing the  narrow  boundary,  a  single  step  over  which  brought  a  Stewart 
or  a  Campbell  into  the  territory  of  friends  or  of  hereditary  foemen. 

The  first  charter  granted  by  James  IV.  to  Duncan  was  the  life- 
rent, "  Litera  Vitalis,"  of  the  lands  of  Duror  and  Glencoe.  Alan 
MacDougall  or  M'Coule  had  received  a  gift  of  these  lands  during 
James'  minority,  perhaps  procured  for  him  for  reasons  not  unconnected 
with  past  events,  but  the  grant  was  revoked  by  James  when  he  reached 
his  majority.  The  MacDonalds  of  Glencoe  had  long  been  settled  there 
as  occupants,  and  their  possession  was  confirmed  to  them  by  the  King 
in  1499.  They  still  remained  in  occupation  of  the  lands,  paying  feu- 
duty  to  Appin  as  superior,  which  Glencoe  still  continues  to  do.  This 
charter,  dated  at  Stirling,  14th  January  1500,  is  "pro  bono  fideli  et 
gratuito  servicio  nobis  per  dilectum  nostrum  Duncanum  Stewart,  filium 
et  heredem  quondam  Dungalli  Stewart  de  Appin  ; "  the  King  thus 
recognising  Dugald's  title  as  heir  of  Appin,  a  title  which  could  only  be 
his  as  succeeding  to  his  father.  Sir  John  Stewart  of  Lorn.  The 
charter,  which  is  given  at  length  in  the  Appendix,  includes,  "  the  seven 

N 


merk  land  of  Coule  of  Durrour,  the  seven  merk  land  of  Ardoch  and 
Lagynhall,  the  three  merk  land  of  Auchincar,  the  five  merk  land  of 
Auchindarroch  and  Auchinblane,  and  the  three  merk  land  of  Belle- 
caulis,  also  the  whole  and  entire  twenty-five  merk  land  of  Glencoyne 
with  its  pertinents,  extending  in  all  to  fifty  merk  lands,  lying  in  the 
Sheriffdom  of  Perth.  Which  lands  were  formerly  in  the  possession 
of  John  M 'Coule  by  our  gift  in  our  minority,  and  now  have  lawfully 
lapsed."  The  lands  of  Glencoe  were  granted  in  1343  by  David  II,  to 
John  of  Yle,  and  were  afterwards  held  from  John  of  Yle  by  John  of 
Larin,  and  were  granted  anew  to  the  latter  in  1354.  In  1475  they  were 
forfeited  by  John  of  Yle,  Earl  of  Ross,  and  in  1476  were  restored  to 
him.  In  1494,  after  the  insurrection  of  Alexander  of  Lochalsh,  the 
titles  and  lordship  of  the  Isles  were  forfeited,  and  subsequently 
voluntarily  surrendered ;  and  in  that  year  James  IV.  granted  John 
Makgilleon  of  Lochbouie,  the  fifty-three  merk  lands  of  Durgwin 
and  Glencole.  These  lands  were  now  granted  by  the  King  to  Duncan 
in  1500,  and  the  grant  was  renewed  in  1501. 

In  1 501  Sir  Duncan  Campbell  of  Glenorchy,  no  doubt  under 
pressure  from  the  King,  made  to  Duncan  Stewart  of  Appin  the  above- 
mentioned  restitution  of  the  one-third  part  of  Appin,  which  Glenorchy 
had  received  in  1470,  comprehending  the  eight  merk  land  of  Cand- 
lochlagane,  the  two  merk  land  of  Auchichoskrachan,  the  two  merk  land 
of  Finalten,  the  four  merk  land  of  Auchnagen,  the  three  merk  land  of 
Inverahawle,  the  one  merk  land  of  Corrylone,  besides  Eilan  Stalcaire 
and  some  other  lands.  In  the  same  year  Sir  Duncan  also  gave  up  to 
Appin  the  twenty  shilling  land  of  Port  Carrane  in  Lismore,  which 
probably  included  the  northern  part  of  the  island  opposite  Appin. 
Both  these  grants  were  in  favour  of  Duncan  Stewart  and  the  heirs  of 
his  body,  with  remainder  to  his  brothers  Alan  and  Robert.  This  is  the 
only  mention  of  Robert  in  the  history  of  the  clan,  nor  is  there  any 
record  of  his  marriage.  If  he  had  had  legitimate  issue  there  seems  no 
reason  to  doubt  that  he  would  have  received  from  the  Chief  a  grant  of 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


land  suitable  to  his  position,  as  was  then  the  invariable  custom  in  the 
Highland  families.  It  has  been  conjectured  that  a  sept  of  the  Stewarts 
known  as  the  M'Robbs,  of  whom  an  account  is  afterwards  given,  are 
descended  from  an  illegitimate  son  of  this  Robert,  but  no  certainty 
exists  on  the  point. 

On  24th  September  1501,  the  Earl  of  Argyll  and  Sir  Duncan 
Campbell  bound  themselves  to  recognise  Duncan  Stewart  as  the  legal 
possessor  of  the  forty  pound  land  of  Appin  "  held  in  heritage  by  his 
deceased  father,  Dugald  Stewart  of  Appin,"  and,  on  the  other  hand, 
Duncan  Stewart  bound  himself  and  his  folks  to  be  obedient  to  the  king's 
laws,  and  not  to  vex  or  trouble  the  tenants  and  vassals  of  the  Earl  and 
Sir  Duncan,  under  the  penalty  of  ;i^200  Scots,  as  a  fine  to  the  King, 
and  ^200  to  the  other  parties  for  "coost  and  skaith,"  besides  paying 
the  skaith  the  Earl  and  his  friends  shall  sustain  from  Duncan  and  his 
friends.  From  this  it  may  be  inferred  that  Dugald  and  his  sons,  un- 
dismayed by  the  strength  of  their  foes,  had  not  ceased  to  assert  their 
rights  by  making  continual  forays  and  "  herschips "  upon  the  lands  of 
Lorn  wrested  from  them. 

In  the  "Scots  Acts  of  Parliament  of  1502,"  Vol.  II.,  pp.  241,  249, 
we  find  James  IV.  also  gave  to  Duncan  a  grant  of  the  liferent  of  the 
royal  lands  of  Mamore,  which  then  included  the  district  now  called 
Nether  Lochaber,  and  of  the  island  of  Dundabray.  The  venerable  Dr 
M'Leod  of  Morven  believes  that  this  is  the  island  still  so  called,  lying 
between  the  coasts  of  Jura  and  Knapdale. 

In  1503  Lachlan  M'Gillean,  or  Maclean,  of  Duart,  joined  Donald 
Dubh  in  his  attempt  to  seize  the  territory  and  authority  of  the  ancient 
Lords  of  the  Isles.  Duncan  Stewart  of  Appin,  at  the  head  of  his  own 
men,  and  the  MacDonalds  of  Glencoe, — who  then  mustered  about  150 
claymores, — was  prominent,  as  King's  Chamberlain  of  the  Isles,  in 
opposing  Maclean,  who  abandoned  Donald  Dubh's  cause,  and  finally 
submitted  in  1505.  Donald  Dubh's  insurrection  was  suppressed  in 
1506,   and  the   result  of  his   defeat  was  to  transfer  to  the    Earls   of 


Huntly  and  Argyll  the  great  power  which  had  been  enjoyed  by  the 
Earls  of  Ross,  the  former  receiving  at  the  same  time  large  grants  of 
land  in  Banffshire,  Strathearn,  and  Lochaber.  Differences  seem  to 
have  arisen  between  Lochiel  and  his  new  neighbour,  for  we  find  in  the 
Acts  of  the  Lords  of  Council  on  i6th  February  1507,  a  decree  against 
"  Ewin  Allansoune "  in  favour  of  "  Archibald  Erie  of  Argile  as 
cessionar  and  assignaye"  to  Alexander  Earl  of  Huntly  for  an  herschip 
of  the  Clan  Cameron  in  Badenoch.  The  name  of  Duncan  Stewart 
does  not  appear  in  this  document,  but  the  friendship  and  alliance  which 
subsisted  between  the  Stewarts  and  the  Camerons — and  which,  indeed, 
became  closer  in  succeeding  generations — prompted  the  chief  of  Appin 
to  come  forward,  not  only  as  the  mediator  between  the  antagonists,  but 
as  security  for  his  friend.  In  consequence  of  this  arrangement  the 
Lords  of  Council  decreed  on  9th  February  1 508  that  Ewin  Allansoune 
and  Duncan  Stewart  should  pay  to  Argyll  the  sum  of  500  merks. 
The  settlement  of  the  claim  seems  to  have  been  deferred  for  some 
years,  for  it  was  not  until  1 5 1 1  that  Ewine  Alansoune  and  Duncan 
Stewart  gave  a  Charter  of  Apprisement  of  the  lands  of  Kilandreist, 
Port  Carran,  and  Kinlochan  in  Lismore,  and  of  the  island  of  Shuna,  in 
favour  of  Archibald  Earl  of  Argyll,  as  part  payment  of  500  merks,  the 
balance  remaining  due  being  possibly  one  of  those  claims  remitted  by 
Argyll  at  the  final  settlement  in  15 12  between  Appin  and  the  Earl,  in 
the  latter's  capacity  of  security  for  Maclean  of  Duart. 

We  have  seen  that  the  lands  of  Glencoe  and  Duror,  after  having 
been  granted  in  1494  to  John  Makgilleon  of  Lochbouie,  had  been  in 
1500  granted  by  James  IV.  to  Duncan  Stewart  of  Appin,  the  Glencoe 
men  having  warmly  espoused  the  cause  of  Donald  Dubh,  whose  escape 
in  1 501  from  prison  in  the  Castle  of  Inchconnell  was  effected  by  their 
gallantry  and  fidelity.  This  transfer  seems  to  have  subsequently  led 
to  a  raid  upon  Duncan's  tenants  by  the  MacLeans,  headed  by 
"  Lauchlan  M'Gillane  of  Dowarde,  Johnne  M'Cane  Maklauchlane  of 
Coll,  and  Dunslavy  M'Barich  of  Ulva."     On  the  9th  May   1509  we 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


find  the  record  of  the  summons  to  the  MacLeans,  and  on  the  21st  July 
of  the  same  year  the  decrees  in  favour  of  Duncan  Stewart,  and  of  his 
Appin  and  Duror  tenants,  which  will  be  found  in  the  Appendix. 

The  settlement  between  Duart  and  Appin  which  had  been  in 
progress  after  the  above  decrees,  seems  to  have  been  interrupted  by 
the  death  in  15 10  of  the  former,  who  was  succeeded  by  his  son  of  the 
same  name.  In  1510  James  IV.  confirmed  to  Duncan  Stewart  of 
Appin  "  the  6^  mark  lands  of  Auchnadialla,  the  6^  mark  lands  of 
Corriemyll,  the  3  mark  lands  of  Canmask,  the  3  mark  lands  of 
Thorane  Carrigh  in  Lochaber,  which  with  other  lands  he  has  acquired 
from  the  deceased  Lauchlan  Magilleon  of  Dowart  in  lieu  of  a  certain 
sum  of  money,  and  under  reversion  on  payment  of  that  sum."  On  the 
8th  of  April  1510  King  James  granted  Duncan  a  Charter  of  Apprise- 
ment.  Carta  Appirciationis,  a  summary  of  which  is  given  in  the 
Appendix,  addressed  to  "  certain  of  our  Sheriffs,  commanding  them 
to  compel  and  distrain  Lachlan  Makgilleon  of  Dowart  for  the  sum  of 
four  thousand  five  hundred  merks  to  be  recovered  from  him  by  our 
beloved  Duncan  Stewart  of  Appin."  MacLean  had  been  ordered  to 
enter  upon  his  lands,  no  doubt  in  succession  to  his  deceased  father,  so 
that  he  might  legally  give  them  over  to  Appin  in  security  for  the  money, 
but  he  had  failed  to  do  so,  and  in  consequence  the  King,  by  advice  of 
his  Council,  received  Duncan  Stewart  as  tenant  of  the  lands  belonging 
to  Lauchlan  MacLean  in  heritage,  granting  MacLean  a  right  of  redemp- 
tion on  payment  to  Appin  of  the  4500  merks  and  expenses  within  seven 
years.  These  lands  comprehended  nearly  the  whole  of  the  islands  of 
Mull  and  Tiree,  lands  in  Jura  and  Knapdale,  in  Morven  and  Lochaber, 
and  also  the  stewardship  of  Garmoran,  now  called  Ardnamurchan. 

The  questions  still  remaining  unsettled  between  Appin  and  Duart 
were  reopened  before  the  Lords  of  Council  in  15 12.  On  the  ist  of 
March  in  that  year  we  find  the  Earl  of  Argyll,  who  was  shortly  to  be- 
come the  father-in-law  of  the  youthful  chief  of  the  MacLeans,  appearing 
as  his  friend  and  becoming  his  security  for  the  amount  at  which  Appin's 


claim  had  been  approximately  fixed  by  arbitrators,  viz.,  1040  merks. 
On  the  following  day  the  Bishop  of  Argyll  comes  forward  to  claim  his 
share  of  any  composition  which  Duncan  might  be  induced  to  accept, 
and  offering  in  return  the  King's  pardon  and  remission  of  all  crimes 
committed  by  Duncan  and  his  clansmen.  On  the  same  day,  the  2nd 
March  15 12,  it  is  decreed  that  the  Earl  of  Argyll  "of  his  own  consent 
as  borgh  and  dettour  for  Lauchlane  Makgillane  of  Dowart  sail  content 
and  pay  to  Duncan  Stewart  of  Appin  the  sovm  of  ane  thousand  and 
fourty  merks  vsuall  money  of  Scotland."  It  was  probably  in  view  of 
Argyll's  taking  upon  himself  this  payment  that  Duncan,  still  on  the 
same  day,  made  application,  jointly  with  Duart,  to  the  Lords  of 
Council  to  give  the  authority  of  their  decree  to  the  decision  of  a 
meeting  of  arbitrators  at  Edinburgh  on  the  19th  of  February  preceding. 
These  arbitrators  were  David  Bishop  of  Galloway,  Alexander  Earl  of 
Huntly,  Archibald  Earl  of  Argyll,  William  Earl  of  Erroll,  and  William 
Scot  of  Balwearie,  and  they  had  awarded  him  in  satisfaction  of  his 
claim  the  sum  of  10 11  merks,  of  which  a  certain  proportion  was  to  be 
paid  to  Duncan's  tenants,  and  the  balance  of  800  merks  to  Duncan 
himself,  at  sundry  specified  terms  within  2  years  and  20  days.  Various 
other  conditions  were  also  imposed  by  the  arbitrators,  one  of  which 
was  that  Duncan  on  his  part  should  restore  to  the  King  his  liferent  or 
heritage  of  the  13  merk  land  lying  beside  the  Castle  of  Inverlochy 
whereof  MacLean  had  an  old  grant.  Duncan  had  evidently  received 
from  James  IV.  before  this  time  a  promise  of  these  lands,  but  the 
charter  itself — granting  to  him,  for  his  good  service  and  for  his  present 
to  the  King  of  a  galley  of  36  oars,  the  liferent  of  the  lands  of  Innerlochy, 
Terelondy,  Drumefour,  and  Auchentoir,  in  the  lordship  of  Lochaber — 
did  not  pass  the  seals  till  the  9th  July  15 12.  On  the  other  hand 
Argyll  was  to  remit  to  Duncan  a  debt  of  100  merks  due  to  the  former, 
and  all  claims  against  Duncan  or  his  tenants,  and  to  "do  his  diligence" 
to  cause  his  uncle.  Sir  Duncan  Campbell,  to  do  the  same.  Argyll  was 
also  to  renew  to  Appin  the  infeftment  of  those  lands  which  the  latter 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


held  of  him,  and  their  mutual  relations  were  to  exist  "  in  kindness  and 
heartliness  in  time  to  come."  A  further  decree  on  the  same  day  makes 
Argyll  liable  for  the  payment  of  the  loi  i  merks,  and  a  still  later  one  of 
the  same  date  sets  forth  that  Lauchlane  Makgillane  of  Dowart  and 
John  Makclane  of  Louchboy  shall  jointly  free,  relieve,  and  keep 
scaithless  the  Earl  of  Argyll  in  respect  of  this  loii  merks,  Dowart 
finally  obliging  himself  to  indemnify  Louchboy. 

An  amicable  settlement  of  these  long  pending  claims  was  thus 
arrived  at,  and  upon  terms  extremely  favourable  to  Mac  Lean  when  com- 
pared with  the  damages  awarded  by  the  Lords  in  council.  It  was  no 
doubt  after  friendly  communications  had  passed  between  Appin  and 
Duart  that  Duncan  proceeded  to  Mull,  as  his  sole  attendant  on  the 
occasion  was  his  henchman.  There  may  perhaps  have  been  no  pre- 
meditated intention  on  the  part  of  the  MacLeans  to  provoke  a  quarrel,  but 
rough  jokes  were  passed  upon  the  size  and  weight  of  Duncan's  follower. 
The  chief  retorted  that  the  Appin  men  were  not  fed  upon  mean  shell- 
fish like  barnacles,  as  the  MacLeans  were  said  to  be;  and  seeing  their 
now  evident  purpose  and  his  own  inevitable  fate,  he  set  his  back  against 
the  rampart  of  the  castle,  and,  pursuing  the  grim  jest,  declared  that 
before  he  died  he  would  make  with  his  dirk  marks  like  barnacles  on 
many  of  the  MacLeans.  He  fell,  overpowered  by  numbers,  after  a 
gallant  resistance. 

MacLea,  now  called  Livingstone,  of  Bachuill  in  Lismore,  hearing 
of  the  death  of  his  chief,  set  out  for  Duart  Castle  at  night  in  his  boat, 
which  was  rowed  by  his  two  red-haired  daughters.  He  scu tried  all  the 
boats  in  the  Port  of  Duart,  and  brought  the  corpse  of  his  chief  to 
Lismore,  in  the  church  of  which  island  it  was  buried.  The  tombstone 
was,  until  lately,  visible  in  the  floor,  but  was  covered  when  some  altera- 
tions were  made  in  the  church  in  1877. 

This  family  of  Livingstone,  commonly  called  the  Barons  of 
Bachuill,  received  in  early  times  a  grant  of  land  in  Lismore,  which  they 
still  hold  as  keepers  of  the  Bishop  of  Lismore's  crozier  or  baculum,  in 


Gaelic  "  Bachuill  Mor."  The  crozier  was  given  up  by  them  a  few  years 
ago  to  the  Duke  of  Argyll,  when  he  granted  a  confirmation  of  their  title 
to  their  old  possession.  The  sept  of  Mac  Lea  or  Livingstone  seem  to 
have  been  very  anciently  seated  in  Appin,  where  they  have  held  lands 
as  tenants  of  the  Stewarts,  and  have  always  followed  their  banner  to 
war.  At  Culloden  four  of  the  name  were  killed  and  one  wounded. 
Dr  David  Livingstone,  the  celebrated  explorer  in  Africa,  was  of  this 
race,  and  some  of  his  relatives  still  reside  in  Appin,  Mr  Livingstone  at 
Portnacroish  being  the  nearest  of  kin.  Dr  David  Livingstone  writes  of 
himself,  "  Our  great  grandfather  fell  at  the  battle  of  Culloden,  fighting 
for  the  old  line  of  kings ; "  and  it  is  doubtless  to  the  baculum  or 
Bachuill  Mor  that  he  alludes,  when  he  recounts  that  his  Roman  Ca- 
tholic ancestors  "  were  made  Protestants  by  the  laird  coming  round  with 
a  man  having  a  yellow  staff,  which  would  seem  to  have  attracted  more 
attention  than  his  teaching,  for  the  new  religion  went  long  afterwards 
— perhaps  it  does  so  still — by  the  name  of  '  the  religion  of  the  yellow 
stick.' " 

For  the  accommodation  of  James  IV.,  Duncan  Stewart  rebuilt  Castle 
Stalcaire,  which  had  previously  been  a  hunting-seat  of  the  Lords  of 
Lorn,  of  the  families  of  MacDougall  and  Stewart.  Eilan  Stalcaire 
signifies  in  Gaelic  Falconer's  Island,  and  tradition  says  that  it  was  often 
inhabited  by  King  James  IV.  and  King  James  V.  when  hunting,  hawk- 
ing, or  fishing  in  Appin  and  the  surrounding  districts.  A  brooch  was 
long  in  the  possession  of  the  Appin  family,  which  had  for  a  pendant  a 
handsome  pearl,  said  to  have  been  taken  out  of  a  salmon  killed  by 
Duncan  when  fishing  in  the  river  Awe  with  James  IV. 

It  was  on  the  9th  July  151 2  that  Duncan  Stewart,  second  of 
Appin,  received  the  charter  of  Inverlochy  which  has  been  above 
noticed,  and  as  his  brother  Alan  led  the  clan  to  Flodden  on  the  9th 
September  1 5 1 3,  it  may  be  concluded  that  his  death  took  place  between 
those  dates.  He  was  never  married,  and  was  succeeded  by  his  brother 
Alan. 


Alan  Stewart,  third  of  Appin,  soon  after  his  succession,  accom- 
panied, together  with  his  five  sons,  King  James  IV.  to  the  disastrous 
field  of  Flodden,  where  that  chivalrous  benefactor  of  the  Stewarts  of 
Appin  was  slain.  Alan  was  not  long  in  finding  the  want  of  his  royal 
kinsman's  friendship  and  protection,  and  in  experiencing  the  truth  of  the 
saying  that  the  country  is  hapless  whose  monarch  is  a  child.  After  the 
battle  of  Flodden  the  Islemen  again  rose  in  rebellion  under  Sir  Donald 
MacDonald  of  Lochalsh,  and  the  Earl  of  Argyll  was  appointed  by  the 
Council  to  the  command  of  the  force  raised  to  subdue  them.  In  15 17 
Argyll  obtained  from  the  Regent  Albany  an  appointment  as  his 
Lieutenant  in  Durrour,  Glencoe,  and  Lochiel,  to  "  keep  the  peace  of  the 
inhabitants ;"  the  peace  desired  being  apparently  that  described  by 
Tacitus,  "  ubi  solitudinem  faciunt,  pacem  appellant,"  they  make  a 
wilderness  and  call  it  peace.  In  15 18  Alan  was  obliged  to  grant  to  the 
Earl  of  Argyll  a  Charter  of  Apprisement  of  the  lands  of  Fasnacloich 
and  Glasdrum ;  but  in  1539,  in  the  reign  of  James  V.,  these  lands  were 
feued  to  Alan  and  his  heirs,  the  Earl  retaining  the  superiority.  On 
the  6th  June  1522,  John  Campbell  of  Calder,  brother  of  the  Earl  of 
Argyll,  obtained  from  Maclean  of  Lochbuy  the  assignment  of  his 
obsolete  and  revoked  charter,  dated  in  1494,  of  the  lands  of  Durrour, 
Glencoe,  and  part  of  the  lands  of  Lochiel,  but  the  Stewarts, 
Mac  Donalds,  and  Camerons  effectually  resisted  his  efforts  to  take 
possession.  On  the  8th  November  1528  a  meeting  took  place  in 
Edinburgh  with  the  view  of  settling  the  questions  in  dispute,  Archibald 
Campbell  of  Skipness,  Alexander  M'lan  M'Alexander  of  Glengarry, 
and  John  M'Alan  M'Donuile  Duff  being  chosen  as  arbitrators.  The 
selection  could  not  certainly  be  considered  a  favourable  one  for  Lochiel 
and  Appin  :  the  first  being  Calder's  brother  and  a  hereditary  foeman, 
while  the  two  latter  could  probably  bear  but  little  favour  towards  Alan 
Stewart  after  the  defeat  and  death  of  their  kinsman  Donall  mac 
Aonghais  of  Keppoch  by  the  hand  of  Dugald  of  Appin,  Alan's  father. 
The  decree  of  the  arbitrators,  confirmed  four  days  later  by  the  Lords 
o 


in  Council,  was,  after  declaring  that  goodwill  was  to  prevail  for  the 
future,  to  award  a  sum  of  400  merks  to  be  paid  to  Calder  by  Lochiel 
and  Appin  for  scaith  done  to  Calder,  but  that  300  merks  of  this  sum 
Avere  to  be  remitted  on  condition  of  their  giving  Calder  their  bond  of  man- 
rent  in  return  for  Calder's  bond  of  maintenance.  Notwithstanding  this 
settlement,  however,  matters  do  not  seem  to  have  gone  on  smoothly, 
for  Calder  subsequently  resigned  these  lands  to  the  King ;  and  the 
Council  of  which  Argyll  was  a  member.  King  James  V.  being  still  in 
minority,  granted  them  to  the  Earl.  In  his  account  of  these  transac- 
tions Gregory  says:  "  For  some  years  after  this  time"  (1520-7)  "the  Isles 
remained  in  a  state  of  comparative  tranquillity,  owing  partly  to  the 
continued  imprisonment  of  Donald  Dubh,  which  deprived  the  Islanders 
of  their  natural  leader.  This  interval  of  peace  was  employed  by  Argyll 
in  extending  his  influence  among  the  chiefs  with  whom  his  commission 

of  lieutenancy  brought  him  in  contact The  principal  coadjutors 

of  Argyll  in  these  plans  for  the  aggrandisement  of  his  family  and  clan, 
were  his  brothers.  Sir  John  Campbell  of  Calder  and  Archibald 
Campbell  of  Skipnish.  Calder,  whose  patrimony  lay  in  the  district  of 
Lorn,  was  particularly  active ;  and  having  acquired  from  Maclean  of 
Lochbuy  certain  claims,  hitherto  ineffectual,  which  that  chief  had  to  the 
lands  of  Lochiel,  Duror,  and  Glencoe,  he  did  not  fail  to  make  use  of 
his  opportunities.  At  first  he  was  violently  resisted  by  the  Camerons 
and  Stewarts,  and  suffered  many  injuries  from  them  in  these  disputes. 
But  by  transferring  his  title  to  these  lands  to  his  brother  Argyll,  and 
employing  the  influence  of  that  nobleman,  Calder  succeeded  in  estab- 
lishing a  certain  degree  of  authority  over  the  unruly  inhabitants,  in  a 
mode  then  of  very  frequent  occurrence.  Ewin  AUanson  of  Lochiel, 
and  Alan  Stewart  of  Duror,  were,  by  the  arbitration  of  friends,  ordered 
to  pay  Calder  a  large  sum  of  damages,  and  likewise  to  give  to  him,  for 
themselves,  their  children,  kin,  and  friends,  their  bond  of  man-rent  and 
service  against  all  men,  except  the  King  and  Argyll.  In  consideration 
of  these  bonds  of  service,  three  fourths  of  the  damages  awarded  were 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


remitted  by  Calder,  who  became  also  bound  to  give  his  bond  of  main- 
tenance in  return.  Finally,  if  the  said  Ewin  and  Alan  should  do  good 
service  to  Sir  John  in  helping  him  to  obtain  lands  and  possessions,  they 
were  to  be  rewarded  by  him  therefor  at  the  discretion  of  the  arbiters. 
By  such  means  was  the  influence  of  the  house  of  Argyll  extended  and 
confirmed  in  the  West  Highlands." 

Colin,  Earl  of  Argyll,  died  in  1530,  and  was  succeeded  by  his  son 
Archibald,  fourth  Earl,  who  pursued  the  same  course  of  intrigue  in  the 
Western  Highlands  ;  but  a  complaint  being  brought  before  the  King 
and  Council  that  he,  his  father,  and  his  uncles  Sir  John  Campbell  of 
Calder,  and  Archibald  Campbell  of  Skipnish,  had  for  a  long  time 
fomented  disturbances  in  the  Highlands  that  they  might  acquire 
possession  of  the  forfeited  estates,  the  Earl  was  summoned  to  Edin- 
burgh to  answer  these  charges,  and  committed  to  prison  by  the  King 
on  his  arrival.  He  was  soon  liberated,  but  was  deprived  of  his  offices, 
which  he  never  regained  during  the  lifetime  of  James  V.  The  King, 
having  revoked  all  charters  granted  during  his  minority,  at  Falkland 
on  the  7th  December  1538,  granted  to  Alan  Stewart,  his  well-beloved 
relation  in  blood  and  servitor,  "dilectus  consanguineus  et  servitor  Alanus 
Stewart  in  Lome,"  a  charter,  given  in  the  Appendix,  of  the  twenty 
pound  land  of  Durrour  in  fee  farm,  viz.,  the  seven  merk  land  of  Coule 
and  Glencalladam,  the  seven  merk  land  of  Ardsell  and  Lagnahall,  the 
three  merk  land  of  Ballychelis,  the  five  merk  land  of  Auchnandarroch, 
the  three  merk  land  of  Auchycarne,  the  five  merk  land  of  Auchychan 
and  Auchinblare,  and  the  twenty  merk  land  of  Glenkowne,  with  all 
their  pertinents,  to  the  value  of  fifty  merks.  The  charter  is  to  Alan 
and  his  heirs,  on  condition  of  their  paying  to  the  king  and  his  heirs  a 
yearly  rent  of  ^40  Scots,  and  "  building  and  keeping  a  sufficient 
mansion  with  hall,  chamber,  kitchen,  barn,  byre,  stables,  dovecots, 
gardens,  orchyards,  etc."  The  charter  is  very  explicit  in  conveying  to 
Alan  and  his  heirs  these  lands  and  their  pertinents,  woods,  plains, 
mosses,    morasses,  waters   stagnant  and   running,    rivulets,   fields    and 


pastures,  mills  with  their  multures  and  sequels,  rights  of  hunting  and 
fishing,  peats,  turf,  timber,  coal,  stone,  lime,  gorse,  broom,  and  every- 
thing above  or  below  ground  pertaining  to  the  said  lands,  to  be  held  in 
peace  without  any  revocation  or  renunciation  whatever  by  the  said 
Alan  and  his  heirs. 

It  might  have  been  reckoned  that  so  full  a  grant  would  have 
effectually  secured  the  peaceable  possession  of  these  lands  to  Alan  and 
his  heirs.  But  James  V.  died  in  1542,  and  in  1547,  when  Queen  Mary 
was  a  child,  and  Argyll  had  regained  his  authority  in  the  West  of 
Scotland,  we  find  Alan  Stewart  resigning  these  lands  of  Duror,  Balla- 
chelish,  and  Glencoe  into  the  hands  of  the  Queen,  and  they  were  re- 
conveyed  to  the  Earl  of  Argyll.  After  the  former  experience  the  Earl 
was  not  likely  again  to  attempt  to  dispossess  Alan  of  this  territory, 
and  it  was  re-granted  to  him,  the  Earl  retaining  the  superiority,  at  a 
somewhat  smaller  feu-rent  than  that  which  Alan,  in  his  original  charter, 
had  covenanted  to  pay  to  the  Crown. 

In  1547,  Somerset,  the  Protector  of  England,  renewed  the  proposal 
of  marriage  between  Edward  VI.  and  Queen  Mary,  and  marched  an 
army  of  18,000  men  into  Scotland  to  compel  the  compliance  of  the 
Scots.  In  the  battle  of  Pinkie,  which  ensued  on  the  loth  September  of 
that  year,  the  Stewarts  of  Appin  bore  their  part,  the  regiment  being 
commanded  by  Donald-nan-ord,  second  of  Invernahyle,  Alan  Stewart 
being  then  an  old  man,  and  his  eldest  son  Duncan  dead,  while  his 
grandson  John,  who  succeeded  him,  was  still  a  minor. 

Alan  Stewart  married  a  daughter  of  Cameron  of  Lochiel,  by 
whom  he  had  five  sons,  all  of  whom  accompanied  their  father  to  the 
field  of  Flodden.

Alan  seems  to  have  died,  at  a  very  advanced  age,  about  or  soon 
after  the  year  1562. 

Duncan  Stewart,  fourth  of  Appin,  appears  to  have  predeceased 
his  father  before  the  battle  of  Pinkie  in  1547,  as  we  find  the  clan  led 
on  that  occasion,  as  above  mentioned,  by  the  Tutor.  He  was  certainly 
dead  before  1562,  as  we  find  that  in  that  year  Alan  Stewart  of  Appin 
resigned  the  lands  in  Lismore,  held  by  him  from  Campbell  of 
Glenorchy,  for  the  purpose  of  having  them  re-granted  to  John  Stewart, 
his  grandson,  the  liferent  of  them,  however,  being  reserved  to  Alan. 
Duncan  married  Jonet  Gordon,  daughter  of  the  Earl  of  Huntly,  who 
had  obtained  the  neighbouring  territory  of  Lochaber.  In  1558  John 
Campbell  of  Calder,  Commendator  of  Ardchattan  Priory,  granted  to 
Jonet  Gordon,  Lady  of  Appin,  in  consideration  of  payments  by  her  for 
repairing  the  church  and  monastery,  the  two  merk  lands  of  Yriskay  and 
Dyrremeanach  for  a  yearly  payment  of  £4  Scots,  and  in  1562  she 
resigned  these  lands  to  John  Campbell,  the  natural  son  of  the 
Commendator. 

Mr  D.  C.  Macpherson,  of  the  Advocates'  Library,  who  has 
published  an  account  of  the  clan  Donald  of  Keppoch,  gives  the  follow- 
ing narrative  relating  to  Duncan,  fourth  of  Appin.  Raonall,  second 
son  of  Raonall  MacDhonaill  Ghlais,  and  eighth  of  Keppoch,  married  a 
daughter  of  Duncan  Stewart,  younger  of  Appin.  It  is  said  that  Stewart 
paid  a  visit  to  his  son-in-law,  and  that  he  was  escorted  on  his  return 
by  a  party  of  the  Keppoch  men,  the  chief  having  promised  him  a  safe 
conduct  out  of  the  parish.  This  was  fulfilled  to  the  letter,  but  as  they 
were  fording  the  river  Nevis  near  Fort  William,  just  as  they  got  to  the 
Kilmallie  side,  one  M 'Arthur  struck  off  Stewart's  head  with  his  axe. 
These  M 'Arthurs  are  still  in  Lochaber,  and  bear  the  nick-name  of 
"  Tuagh  bhearnach  Mhic-Artair,"  the  M'Arthurs  of  the  hacked  axe. 
The  daughter  of  Appin   took  with   her  to   Keppoch  some  Stewarts, 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


named  Dubh-shuilich,  from  their  dark  heavy  eyebrows,  who  were  ever 
after  the  "  Fir-bhrataich "  or  standard-bearers  of  the  Keppochs,  and 
their  descendants  are  still  in  that  country.  This  violent  end  would 
account  for  the  death  of  Duncan  during  his  father's  lifetime.  He  left 
one  son  John. 

John  Stewart,  fifth  of  Appin,  was  called,  from  his  complexion  and 
his  maternal  descent,  "Gordonich  baan,"  the  fair  Gordon.  In  the  "Black 
Book  of  Taymouth"  it  is  stated  that,  on  4th  December  1570,  John 
Stewart  of  Appin  entered  into  a  mutual  contract  with  Colin  Campbell 
of  Glenurquhay  for  their  common  defence.  He  is  also  mentioned  in 
records  of  the  year  1580.  In  the  Acts  of  1587,  on  "  The  Roll  of  the 
Names  of  the  Landislordes  and'Baillies  of  Landis  in  the  Hielandis  and 
lies,  quhair  Brokin  men  hes  duelt  and  presentlie  duellis,"  we  find  103 
names,  commencing  with  that  of  Ludovick,  second  duke  of  Lennox,  and 
ending  with  that  of  The  Lord  Hamiltown  (Lord  John  Hamilton, 
proprietor  of  Arran,  and  afterwards  Marquis  of  Hamilton),  and  among 
them  is  "Johnne  Stewart  of  the  Appin."  And  in  the  same  year,  on 
"  The  Roll  of  the  Clannis  (in  the  Hielandis  and  lies)  that  hes  Capitanes, 
Cheiffis,  and  Chiftanes  on  quhome  thay  depend,  oft  tymes  aganis  the 
willis  of  thair  landislordis  :  and  of  sum  speciale  persones  of  branchis  of 
the  saidis  clannis  "  there  appear  thirty-four  names,  among  whom  are  the 
"Stewartis  of  Lome  or  of  Appin."  Also  in  the  Rotation  of  the 
Highland  Clans,  as  mentioned  in  the  two  Acts  of  Parliament  of  1587 
and  1594,  forty-two  names  are  recorded,  the  eleventh  on  the  list  being 
"  Stewarts  of  Appin." 

In  1592  an  extensive  conspiracy  was  entered  into,  having  for  its 
object  the  murder  of  the  "  bonnie  Earl  of  Murray,"  Archibald  7th  Earl 
of  Argyle,  and  his  kinsman  James  Campbell  of  Calder,  the  principal 
administrator  of  the  affairs  of  the  latter  earldom.  In  Februar}'  1592, 
the  Earl  of  Murray  was  murdered  at  his  house  of  Donibristle  in  Fife, 
by  a  party  of  the  Gordons  under  the  command  of  the  Earl  of  Huntly. 
Sir  Duncan  Campbell  of  Glenorchy,  Dugald  Campbell  of  Auchinbreck, 


and  Archibald  Campbell  of  Lochnell,  three  of  the  guardians  of  the 
young  Earl  of  Argyll,  were  among  the  conspirators  of  the  West ;  and, 
as  brother-in-law  of  Lochnell,  John  Stewart  of  Appin  was  induced  to 
join  the  plot,  and,  with  him,  Cameron  of  Lochiel  and  MacDougall  of 
Dunolly.  Sir  John  Campbell  of  Ardkinglass  next  became  an  accessory, 
and  procured  the  services  of  an  assassin  named  M'Ellar,  who  shot 
Calder  in  the  house  of  Knepoch  in  Lorn,  in  February  1592.  Ardking- 
lass' hereditary  feud  with  Calder  caused  him  to  be  suspected,  and  he 
was  consequently  threatened  with  the  vengeance  of  the  young  Argyll. 
Glenorchy  then  ventured  to  communicate  to  him  the  plan  of  getting 
rid  of  the  Earl  and  his  brother,  but  Ardkinglass  refused  to  be  a  party  to 
it.  Had  this  part  of  the  plot  been  carried  out,  Lochnell  would  have 
succeeded,  as  heir,  to  the  earldom,  Glenorchy  was  to  have  received 
the  barony  of  Lochow  and  Benderaloch,  and  MacDougall  the  lands  of 
Luing,  while  John  Stewart  was  to  have  had  all  the  lands  in  Lorn 
belonging  to  the  Earl,  an  arrangement  which  clearly  shows  that  the 
claim  of  his  family  to  Lorn  was  still  recognised,  even  by  some  among 
the  Campbells  themselves.  These  occurrences  served  to  embitter  still 
further  the  feud  between  the  families. 

John  Stewart  married,  first,  Katharine,  daughter  of  John  gorm 
Campbell,  first  of  Lochnell,  and  widow  of  John  Maclean  of  Kinlochaline, 
by  whom  he  had  one  son,  Duncan,  his  successor ;  and,  secondly,  a 
daughter  of  Macdonald  of  Muidart,  who  bore  to  him  a  son,  John,  after- 
wards of  Ardsheal.  He  had  also  a  daughter,  married  to  Alan  Cameron 
of  Lochiel.  John  Drummond  of  Bathaldie,  in  his  memoir  of  Sir  Ewen 
Cameron,  says  of  her  that  "  she  was  a  handsome  young  lady,  and  by 
an  excess  of  beauty,  witt,  and  good-nature,  so  gained  upon  her  husband's 
affections  that  he  continued  fond  of  her  all  his  life."  John  Stewart 
of  Appin  must  have  died  previous  to,  or  in  the  early  part  of,  1595. 

Duncan  Stewart,  sixth  of  Appin,  succeeded  his  father,  and  in 
1595  the  possession  of  the  lands  in  Lismore  was  confirmed  by  the 
superior.  Sir  Duncan  Campbell  of  Glenorchy,  to  "  Duncan  Stewart  of 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


Appin,  son  of  the  deceased  John  Stewart."  In  1595  Duncan  Stewart 
granted,  in  heritage,  to  GilHemichael  M'Ewin  V'lUemichael  in  Annat, 
the  "  domus  bruerie  "  of  Annat,  and  certain  land  bounded  by  the  rivulet 
of  Annat  on  the  west,  by  the  "  pule  "  called  Lyn  Ruagh  on  the  south, 
by  the  rivulet  of  Achnagone  on  the  east,  and  by  the  ridge  "  lie  edge 
montis,"  between  the  rivulets  of  Annat  and  Achnagone,  on  the  north. 
These  lands  form  part  of  the  estate  now  called  Kinlochlaigh. 

It  was  in  Duncan's  lifetime  that  there  lived  and  sang  a  poetess  of 
the  Siol  Tormod,  or  clan  MacLeod  of  Harris,  called  Mairi  Nighean 
Alasdair  Ruaidh.  It  would  appear  from  the  following  effusion — unless, 
indeed,  it  is  to  be  regarded  as  entirely  fanciful — that  there  had  been 
some  project  of  a  marriage  between  Stewart  of  Appin  and  a  daughter 
of  MacLeod,  by  which  Appin  hoped  to  acquire  some  of  the  MacLeod 
lands.  This  seems  to  have  been  displeasing  to  the  clan,  and  Mary 
embodied  their  feeling  in  the  following  stanza  of  a  poem,  which  has 
been  translated  from  the  original  Gaelic  by  the  Rev.  Alexander  Stewart, 
Nether  Lochaber : — 

"  Mac  Ian  Stewart  of  Appin, 
Though  thou  art  a  fine  young  fellow, 
Though  the  Stewarts  are  high-minded, 
And  know  what  they  should  do  in  wax, 
Take  no  thought  nor  heed  (of  acquiring) 
Of  lands  which  are  not  thine  by  right ; 
Thou  canst  not  take  them  in  spite  of  us. 
And  with  our  will  they  shall  never  be  thine." 

The  records  at  Dunvegan  supply  no  clue  to  the  project  to  which 
the  bardess  alludes,  and  there  was  no  connection  by  marriage  between 
the  families  of  the  Chiefs  of  MacLeod  and  Appin  till  after  her  death. 

Duncan  married  a  daughter  of  Campbell  of  Lochnell,  by  whom  he 
had  three  sons — Duncan,  his  successor,  and  John  and  Alan,  An  old 
family  MS.  states  that  these  two  latter  "appear  to  have  had  no  issue, 
as   the   ingenious  author  of  the  '  Histoiy  of  the   Stewarts'  mentions 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


nothing  of  them  but  their  Christian  names,  and  narrates  that  in  the  suc- 
ceeding generation  the  Laird  of  Ardsheal  was  Tutor,  as  nearest  of  kin 
to  Appin,  a  fact  universally  known  to  all  the  branches  of  this  family." 

Duncan  Stewart,  seventh  of  Appin,  succeeded  his  father.  It  was 
this  Chief  of  Appin  who  was  persuaded,  during  a  carousal,  to  give  up 
Castle  Stalcaire  to  Campbell  of  Airds  in  exchange  for  an  eight-oared 
"  beorlin"  or  wherry.  Appin  endeavoured  to  have  the  unfair,  and  no 
doubt  vinous,  bargain  recalled  ;  but  Airds  refused  to  cancel  a  transaction 
so  advantageous  to  himself,  and  Duncan,  who,  if  not  discreet,  was  at  all 
events  honourable,  would  not,  without  the  other's  consent,  retract  his 
word,  though  it  had  been  passed  in  circumstances  under  which  its 
fulfilment  should  certainly  not  have  been  exacted.  The  Stewart  clan 
were  indignant  at  seeing  the  alienation  of  the  castle,  which  was  not  only 
their  principal  fortress,  but  which  was  a  natural  object  of  their  pride  as 
having  been  built  for  and  occupied  by  the  kings  who  had  owned  them 
as  kinsmen,  and  assembled  to  consider  whether  they  should  not  appoint 
one  of  Duncan's  brothers  to  be  their  chief  instead  of  this  "  Baothaire," 
or  soft,  easily-persuaded  man,  as  they  nick-named  Duncan.  The 
offended  clan  did  not  go  so  far  as  to  depose  him,  but  resolved  that  he 
should  not  lead  them  in  any  expedition  of  war.  In  consequence  of  this 
decision  they  were  led  on  these  occasions  by  the  chief's  brother  John — 
at  least  until  Duncan's  son,  Duncan  Mor,  had  attained  majority — as  in 
1614  we  find  John  was  summoned  to  Edinburgh  to  answer  charges 
brought  against  the  Stewarts  by  the  Earl  of  Argyll  for  forays  upon  his 
lands.  It  does  not  appear  that  John  obeyed  the  summons,  but  on  the 
9th  May  1620  Duncan  Mor  Stewart,  younger  of  Appin,  son  of  Duncan 
seventh  baron,  granted  an  assignment  of  his  rights  in  two  bonds  by 
James  Spreul  of  Coldane  and  William  Murray,  in  favour  of  Matthew 
White,  keeper  of  the  Tolbooth  at  Edinburgh,  as  a  condition  of  his 
liberation.  As  this  assignment  is  enumerated  in  the  Reports  previously 
referred  to  as  existing  amongst  the  Argyll  papers,  it  seems  probable 
that  the  heir  of  Appin  had  been  seized  to  answer  the  complaints  made 
p 


by  the  Earl  of  Argyll's  son,  to  whom  the  Earl  had  conveyed  his  estates 
previous  to  his  forfeiture.  This  forfeiture  had  taken  place  in  1618, 
when  Argyll  had  made  open  defection  from  the  Protestant  faith  and 
gone  to  Spain,  where  he  was  intriguing  with  the  banished  Sir  James 
Macdonald  and  Allaster  MacRanald  of  Keppoch.  In  consequence  of 
this,  in  December  of  that  year  twenty  of  the  Argyllshire  barons  were 
summoned  before  the  Privy  Council,  and  to  each  was  assigned  a  district 
in  which  he  was'  responsible  for  the  preservation  of  the  peace ;  Lochnell, 
Stewart  of  Appin,  the  MacDougalls  of  Dunolly  and  Reray,  and  the 
Campbells  of  Dunstaffnage,  Barbreck,  and  Glenfalloch  being  appointed 
for  Upper  Lorn. 

The  Castle  of  Eilean  Stalcaire  has  ever  since  continued  to  be  the 
property  of  the  Campbells,  the  unequal  compact  having  been  honourably 
observed  by  the  Stewarts ;  but  on  the  outbreak  of  hostilities  on  subse- 
quent occasions,  it  was  promptly  seized  and  held  for  the  king  by  its  old 
possessors,  in  their  capacity  of  Hereditary  Keepers  of  the  Castle. 

Duncan  married  a  daughter  of  Cameron  of  Locheil,  and  had  issue 
— Duncan,  his  successor  ;  Alan,  who  married  a  daughter  of  Maclean  of 
Coll ;  and  Donald,  who  was  father  of  William  Stewart,  a  priest,  who 
was  murdered  at  Rome  in  1737. 

Duncan  Stewart,  eighth  of  Appin,  called  Duncan  Mor,  succeeded 
to  the  estate  on  his  father's  death,  after  having  been  for  many  years 
virtually  the  leader  of  the  clan.  On  the  30th  January  1 645  he  was  one 
of  those  who  signed  "  ane  Band  of  Unione  amongst  all  his  Majestie's 
faithfull  subjects,"  and  according  to  his  promise  therein,  he  took  the  field 
at  the  head  of  his  clan  to  join  the  Marquess  of  Montrose.  On  a  clear 
and  cold  Sunday  morning,  on  the  2nd  February  1645,  the  Stewarts  of 
Appin  were  in  the  centre  of  the  great  Marquess'  army  at  the  battle  of 
Inverlochy,  where  they  distinguished  themselves  by  their  furious  valour, 
doubly  inspired,  as  Hogg  has  beautifully  expressed  it,  by  their  loyalty 
to  the  Royal  head  of  the  House  of  Stewart,  and  by  their  desire  to 
avenge  the  many  injuries  they  had  sustained  from  Argyll.     The  skilful 


strategy  of  Montrose  had  cut  off  from  the  Campbells  their  only  line  of 
retreat,  which  was  towards  Ballachelish,  and  on  their  defeat  they  were 
thus  forced  backwards  on  the  sea  and  the  river  Lochy,  where  many 
were  drowned  in  their  flight,  their  loss  being  not  less  than  1 500  killed. 
Duncan  Mor  continued  in  arms  during  the  whole  campaign,  and  after 
the  defeat  of  Montrose  at  Philiphaugh  on  13th  September  1645,  joined 
Sir  Alexander  MacCoU  Macdonald,  who  still  kept  the  field  in  Argyll- 
shire for  King  Charles.  After  Sir  Alexander  was  forced  to  retire  to 
Ireland,  the  district  of  Appin  was  sentenced  to  be  ravaged  with  fire  and 
sword,  but  was  saved  from  this  extremity  by  the  intervention  of  Major 
James  Stewart  of  Ardvoirlich.  Major  Stewart  had  faithfully  served 
King  Charles  in  Montrose's  army,  but  he  was  a  man  of  high  temper, 
and  in  a  private  quarrel  after  the  battle  of  Tippermuir,  he  unhappily 
killed  Lord  Kilpont,  son  of  William  i8th  Earl  of  Menteith,  after  which 
he  was  obliged  in  self-defence  to  ally  himself  with  Argyll  and  the 
Covenanters.  By  his  interest  with  General  Leslie,  Major  Stewart  also 
saved  the  life  of  Henry  Stewart,  the  laird  of  Baith  or  Beach. 

The  execution  of  Charles  L,  on  20th  January  1649,  was  loudly 
condemned  in  Scotland,  and  his  son  was  proclaimed  King  on  the  5th  of 
the  following  month.  Loyalty  to  the  Sovereign  was  for  the  moment 
in  the  ascendant,  and  among  the  names  of  Royalist  gentlemen  who 
were  appointed  Commissioners  of  Supply  in  the  beginning  of  that  year, 
we  find  that  of  Duncan  Stewart  of  Appin.  But  with  Charles  II.'s 
rejection  of  the  overtures  of  the  Presbyterians,  a  change  came  over  the 
spirit  of  the  Covenanters,  and  the  gallant  but  ill-fated  attempt  by 
Montrose,  terminating  in  his  capture  in  Assynt,  and  his  execution  on 
25th  May  1649,  had  the  effect  of  bringing  down  the  vengeance  of  the 
Government  upon  the  heads  of  those  who,  four  years  before,  had  borne 
their  share  in  the  brilliant  victories  of  the  great  Marquess  at  Inverlochy, 
Auldearn,  and  Kilsyth,  and  who  were  perhaps  known  to  be  now  pre- 
paring to  rejoin  him.  Thus  we  find  from  the  Scots  Acts  Parliament  of 
7th    August   1649   that  Sir  Archibald  Johnstone  of  Warristoun,   His 


Majesty's  Advocate,  presented  a  petition  against  Murdoch  Maclean  of 
Lochbuy,  Duncan  Stewart,  younger  of  Appin,  Alexander  Stewart  of 
Invernaheil,  and  Hector  Maclaine  of  Kingerloch,  for  joining  James 
Grahame  at  Kilsythe,  and  being  with  him  with  all  the  men  they  could 
command  at  the  battle  of  Inverlochie,  and  at  divers  other  places,  for 
which  they  were  forfaulted  in  persons,  lands,  and  estates. 

Duncan  Mors  forfeiture  was,  of  course,  cancelled  on  the  accession 
of  Charles  II.  in  1660,  and  in  the  Acts  of  the  Scots  Parliament  of  the 
following  year,  Duncane  Stewart  of  Apyne  is  named  as  a  Commissioner  of 
Supply  for  Argyleshire,  and  also  as  one  of  His  Majesty's  Commissioners 
for  regulating  and  uplifting  certain  excise  duties.  He  married  Jean, 
daughter  of  Sir  Robert  Campbell  of  Glenorchy,  but  his  only  child  was 
a  daughter,  Margaret,  who  married  Campbell  of  Lochnell,  his  lands 
and  the  chiefship  passing  on  his  death,  which  occurred  apparently  before 
1685,  to  his  nephew,  Robert,  only  son  of  his  brother  Alan,  by  his  wife, 
the  daughter  of  Maclean  of  Coll. 

Robert  Stewart,  ninth  of  Appin,  succeeded  his  uncle.  The 
first  mention  of  him  is  in  1685,  in  the  Acts  of  Parliament  of 
which  year  we  find  "  Stuart  of  Appin  or  his  Tutor "  appointed  a 
Commissioner  of  Supply.  He  hastened  from  college  to  accompany 
the  clan  when,  on  account  of  his  youth,  it  Avas  led  by  John 
Stewart  of  Ardsheal,  who,  as  next  of  kin,  was  his  Tutor,  to  join  Vis- 
count Dundee  when  he  declared  for  King  James  VII.  in  16S9.  In 
expectation  of  aid  both  in  men  and  money  from  King  James,  then  in 
Ireland,  Dundee  came  to  Inverlochy,  where  he  was  in  the  midst  of  the 
loyal  clans  of  Camerons,  Stewarts,  MacDonalds,  and  MacLeans.  On 
his  arrival  at  Inverlochy  he  found  the  Stewarts  of  Appin  and  the  Mac- 
Naughtons  awaiting  him,  having  received  notice  from  Lochiel  of  his 
coming.  Writing  of  the  events  of  this  year,  Lord  Macaulay  has  said 
that  "  while  England  and  Scotland  were  execrating  the  tyranny  of 
James,  he  was  honoured  as  a  deliverer  in  Appin  and  Lochaber,  in  Glen- 
roy  and  Glenmore,"  and  he  proceeds  to  ascribe  the  Jacobitism  of  the 


Highlanders  at  that  time  to  their  dread  and  hatred  of  the  grasping 
and  insatiable  house  of  Argyll,  putting  his  case  with  perhaps  even 
more  than  his  usual  force  and  eloquence.  But  this  theory,  though  pos- 
sibly not  absolutely  devoid  of  foundation  as  regards  the  events  of  1689, 
would  entirely  fail  to  account  for  the  attachment  of  the  Highlanders  to 
the  cause  of  the  Stuarts  in  1715  and  1745,  when  their  lives  or  estates 
were  hardly  in  greater  danger  from  MacCailein  Mor  than  they  are  at 
the  present  day  ;  and  the  dispassionate  observer,  after  reading  the  record 
of  Highland  fidelity  and  devotion  in  1745  and  1746,  will  hardly  be  dis- 
posed to  endorse  the  conclusions  of  the  Whig  historian  in  this  matter. 

Dundee  remained  for  some  time  in  Lochaber,  anxiously  awaiting 
the  arrival  of  troops  and  supplies  from  Ireland.  Macaulay  says  it  was 
impossible  for  him  to  keep  his  Highlanders  together  in  a  state  of 
inactivity.  A  vast  extent  of  moor  and  mountain  was  required  to 
furnish  food  for  so  many  mouths.  The  clans  therefore  went  back  to 
their  own  glens,  having  promised  to  reassemble  on  the  first  summons. 
A  few  weeks  after,  hostilities  broke  out  more  violently  than  before. 
Stewart  of  Ballechin,  at  a  meeting  of  the  Stewarts  of  Athole  and  the 
Marquis  of  Athole's  vassals,  filled  his  bonnet  with  water  from  a  neigh- 
bouring stream,  drank  a  health  to  King  James,  and  immediately  seized 
in  his  interest  Blair  Castle,  which  occupies  a  commanding  position  at 
the  head  of  the  Pass  of  Killiecrankie.  Lord  Murray,  the  eldest  son  of 
the  Marquis,  and  a  declared  Williamite,  demanded  admission  to  his 
father's  house,  but  the  garrison  refused  to  open  the  gates.  On  the 
fate  of  Blair  Castle  probably  depended  the  fate  of  all  Athole.  On  the 
fate  of  Athole  might  depend  the  fate  of  Scotland.  Dundee  hastily 
summoned  all  the  clans  who  acknowledged  his  commission  to  prepare 
for  an  expedition  into  Athole.  The  fiery  crosses  were  sent  again  in  all 
haste  through  Appin  and  Ardnamurchan,  up  Glenmore,  and  along 
Loch  Leven  ;  but  the  call  was  so  unexpected,  and  the  time  allowed  so 
short,  that  the  muster  was  not  a  very  full  one.  Dundee  had  only  1900 
Highlanders  with  him  when,  after  his  rapid  march  across  the  mountains 


of  Lochaber  and  Badenoch  to  anticipate  Mackay,  he  so  signally  defeated 
that  general  about  sunset  on  the  17th  June  16S9.  It  has  been  doubted 
whether  the  Stewarts  of  Appin  took  part  in  the  battle  of  Killiecrankie, 
or  Roinn  Rhuari,  as  the  Highlanders  call  it.  Lord  Macaulay  says 
that  "the  Stewarts  of  Appin  who,  though  full  of  zeal,  had  not  been 
able  to  come  up  in  time  for  the  battle,  were  among  the  first  who 
arrived  after  it." 

This  statement,  however,  is  not  quite  correct,  but  the  mistake  may 
have  not  unnaturally  arisen  from  the  circumstance  that  a  considerable 
body  of  the  Stewarts  joined  the  Highland  army  two  days  after  the 
battle,  and  this  fact  being  mentioned  by  Drummond  of  Bathaldie  in  his 
memoir  of  Sir  Ewen  Cameron,  Lord  Macaulay  and  other  historians 
have  erroneously  concluded  that  no  part  of  the  clan  had  any  share  in 
the  victory.  But  before  passing  sentence  of  attainder  upon  the  chief 
men  engaged  in  Dundee's  rising,  the  Scots  Parliament  examined  wit- 
nesses to  prove  the  complicity  of  the  accused.  Among  these  was 
Lieut.  James  Colt,  who  deposed  that  he  had  been  taken  prisoner  by 
Dundee  and  carried  by  him  to  Inverlochy,  and  that  "  he  saw  a  young 
man,  who  was  said  to  be  Stewart  of  Appin,  join  Dundee  between 
Lochaber  and  Badenoch  with  a  hundred  and  thretty  men  of  his  own 
with  him."  James  Malcolm  became  King's  evidence,  and  deponed 
that  he  saw  Stewart  of  Appin  join  Dundee  in  Lochaber  with  a  company 
of  men,  who  had  colours.  The  helmet  worn  by  Robert  Stewart  of 
Appin  at  Killiecrankie  is  still  in  possession  of  Dugald  Stuart  of  Loch- 
carron,  one  of  the  family  of  Ballachelish.  The  following  extracts  from 
a  letter  written  shortly  after  the  battle  by  Alexander  Stewart  of  Balla- 
chelish to  his  kinsman  of  Invernahyle,  show  clearly  that  a  part  of  the 
Appin  clan  had  joined  Dundee  before  he  encountered  Mackay  at  Roinn 
Rhuari.  "  When  Lochiel  got  letters  from  Claverhouse  he  came  to  see 
Appin,  and  upon  this  we  all  went  to  Letter  Shuna,"  the  Gaelic  name 
for  the  place  where  Appin  House  stands.  "  Everything  was  settled 
overnight,  and  Lochiel  came  on  with  me  the  day  after,  and  slept  with 


us.  Next  day  I  put  him  on  the  loch,  etc."  The  letter,  which  will  be 
found  at  length  in  the  Appendix,  then  goes  on  to  say  :  "  At  Roinn 
Rhuari  I  was  hurt  in  the  hand,  and  we  went  on  to  Dunkeld,  and  tried 
to  take  the  Cathedral,  where  poor  Sandy  was  killed."  "  Sandy  "  was 
a  brother  of  John  Stewart,  third  of  Ardsheal.  Against  the  latter, 
described  as  Tutor  of  Appin,  abundant  evidence  was  forthcoming 
before  Parliament  as  to  his  having  led  the  clan.  It  therefore  seems 
probable  that  Ardsheal  had  been  in  command  of  the  clan  at  the  original 
muster  at  Inverlochy,  and  that  when  Dundee's  hasty  summons  arrived, 
the  young  chief  set  off  at  once  with  the  men  nearest  at  hand,  leaving 
the  Tutor  to  follow  with  the  main  body.  The  detachment  of  the 
Stewarts  present  at  the  battle  seems  to  have  been  brigaded  with  their 
fast  friends  the  Camerons,  a  large  body  of  whom  also  only  arrived  two 
days  afterwards. 

In  the  end  of  last  century  Professor  Kennedy  of  Aberdeen  wrote 
a  curious  rhyming  ballad  in  Latin,  in  which  he  enumerates  the  prin- 
cipal gentlemen  who  were  in  Dundee's  army.  The  poem  is  entitled, 
"  Proelium  Gilliecrankianum,"  and  in  the  following  verse  Macneil  of 
Barra,  the  Chiefs  of  Glencoe,  Keppoch,  and  Appin,  and  Stewart  of 
Ballechin  and  his  brother,  are  named  among  those  who  "fought 
bravely  "  for  James  VII. : — 

"  Macneillus  de  Bara,  Glencono,  Keppochanus, 
Ballechinus  cum  fratre,  Stewartus  Apianus, 
Pro  Jacobo  Septimo  fortiter  gessere, 
Pugiles  fortissimi  feliciter  vicere." 

The  death  of  Dundee  at  Killiecrankie  was  more  fatal  to  the  cause 
of  the  Stewarts  than  a  defeat  of  his  army  would  have  been,  as  his  suc- 
cessor, General  Cannon,  if  not  actually  incapable,  had,  at  all  events, 
none  of  the  genius  necessary  for  conducting  Highland  warfare.  Dis- 
gusted with  his  inefficiency,  Lochiel  returned  home ;  the  Stewarts, 
however,  remained  and  lost  many  men,  including  the  Tutor's  brother, 
in  the  ineffectual  attacks  on  the  Cathedral  and  house  of  Dunkeld,  which 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


were  defended  by  the  newly  raised  regiment,  "  The  Cameronians,"  now 
the  26th  of  the  Line,  whose  colours,  which  have  since  been  proudly 
borne  in  every  quarter  of  the  world,  were,  on  that  day,  for  the  first 
time  unfurled.  Seeing,  at  length,  that  no  lasting  success  could  be 
achieved  under  such  a  commander,  the  Highland  Chiefs  assembled  at 
Blair  Castle  on  the  24th  August  1689,  and,  having  signed  the  follow- 
ing bond  of  association,  went  home  ;  the  small  contingent  promised  by 
many  of  the  chiefs  showing  how  heavy  had  been  their  losses  in  the 
victory  of  Killiecrankie  and  the  ineffectual  attack  on  Dunkeld.  The 
Bond,  which  was  produced  to  the  Scots  Parliament  on  the  13th  June 
1690,  is  as  follows : — -"Wee,  Lord  James  Murray,  Patrick  Stewart  of 
Balbehan,  S"^-  John  McLean,  Sir  Donald  McDonald,  S"^-  Ewan  Cameron,

They  were  consequently  forfaulted  on  the  i6th  July  1690.  It  is, 
therefore,  evident  that  none  of  the  signatories  had  taken  advantage  of 
the  Proclamation  of  William  and  Mary,  dated  22nd  August  1689,  offer- 
ing indemnity  to  all,  "including  Chieftanes  of  Clans,"  who  would 
surrender  betwixt  that  date  and  3rd  September,  but  threatening  all  those 
who  "continue  obstinat  and  incorrigible  that  they  shall  be  punished 
with  the  utmost  rigour  of  the  law."  Indeed,  if  we  are  to  suppose  that 
the  Proclamation  was  issued  in  Scotland  on  the  day  on  which  it  bears 
date,  the  Bond  above  quoted  may,  perhaps,  be  regarded  as  the  deli- 
berate and  defiant  answer  of  the  confederate  chiefs.  Later  in  the  same 
year  Robert  Stewart  of  Appin  was  surprised  by  the  Governor  of  Inver- 
lochy,  and  sent  prisoner  by  sea  to  Glasgow,  but  was  released,  perhaps 
in  consequence  of  his  youth,  by  the  direct  order  of  Queen  Mary,  then 
governing  in  the  absence  of  William  III.  in  Ireland.  Ardsheal,  as 
Tutor  of  Appin,  and  as  his  representative  in  the  office  of  Heredi- 
tary Keeper,  continued  to  hold  Castle  Stalcaire  for  King  James 
until  October  1690,  when  he  surrendered  it  on  very  honourable 
terms. 

The  Stewarts  of  Appin  narrowly  escaped  the  same  fate  which  befell 
their  friends  and  neighbours,  the  MacDonalds  of  Glencoe,  in  the  memor- 
able massacre  of  1692.  There  is  a  letter  written  by  Lord  Stair  on  the 
7th  January  1692,  and  signed  by  William  III.,  to  Sir  Thomas  Living- 
stone, Colonel  Hamilton,  and  Colonel  Hill,  Governor  of  Inverlochy, 
informing  them  that  the  intention  was  "  to  destroy  intearly  the  country  of 
Lochaber,  Lochiel's  lands,  Keppoch's,  Glengarry's,  Apine,  and  Glenco;" 
and  he  adds,  "  I  assure  you  your  power  shall  be  full  enough,  and  I  hope 
the  soldiers  will  not  trouble  the  Government  with  prisoners."  Lord 
Caermarthen,  afterwards  Duke  of  Leeds,  remonstrated  so  strongly  with 
William,  that  the  order  was  withdrawn,  though  Lord  Stair  afterwards 
sought  and  found  occasion  to  earn  for  himself  his  unenviable  reputation 
by  destroying  the  Glencoe  men.  A  commission  of  inquiry  into  the 
massacre  was  granted  on  the  29th  April  1695,  and  it  was,  perhaps,  in 
Q 


consequence  of  their  highly  condemnatory  report,  which  was  after- 
wards adopted  by  Parh'ament,  that  Robert  Stewart  of  Appin  was,  in 
that  year,  named  as  a  Commissioner  of  Supply  for  Argyllshire,  possibly 
with  the  view  of  making  some  amends  by  thus  officially  recognising  his 
position.  In  Queen  Anne's  Parliament  of  1 704  we  find  this  appoint- 
ment renewed. 

About  the  year  17 10  or  171 2,  the  Macgregors  had  expelled  a 
MacLaren  from  a  farm  in  Balquidder,  and  the  Chief  of  Appin  marched 
with  200  men  to  the  assistance  of  his  old  allies.  The  Macgregors 
also  mustered  in  force,  but  were  overawed,  and  submitted  without 
bloodshed,  saying  that  they  were  all  one  king's  men,  and  should 
not  fight. 

On  the  ist  of  August  1714,  Robert  Stewart  of  Appin  was  summoned 
to  Edinburgh  to  give  security  that  he  would  not  join  in  any  rising 
against  the  Government.  He  did  not,  however,  obey  the  summons, 
and  Campbell,  captain  of  Castle  Stalcaire,  wrote  his  chief  that  "the 
Stewarts  of  Appin  were  preparing  eighty  more  targets  in  addition  to 
the  great  number  they  already  had."  Robert  Stewart  attended  the 
famous  hunting  party  of  the  Earl  of  Mar  on  the  27th  August  1715,  on 
the  Braes  of  Mar.  According  to  a  History  of  Scotland  published  in 
Dublin  in  1724,  the  names  of  those  present  were  :  "  the  Marquises  of 
Huntly,  Tulibardine,  Seaforth  and  Drommond  ;  the  Earls  of  Marshall, 
Linlithgow,  Southesk,  Strathmore,  and  Broadalbin  ;  the  Lords  Kilsyth, 
Strathallan,  Rollo,  Ogilvy,  Pitsligo,  and  Duffus  ;  the  Lairds  of  Glen- 
garry, Clanronald,  Glenco,  Appin,  Innerytie,  Garntully,  Balcaskie,  and 
many  other  gentlemen  of  the  first  and  best  families  in  the  nation."  In 
accordance  with  the  engagement  then  entered  into,  the  Chief  of  Appin 
took  the  field  at  the  head  of  250  men,  and  was  present  at  the  indecisive 
battle  of  Sheriffmuir,  on  the  13th  November.  The  Earl  of  Mar  then 
fell  back  on  Perth.  The  attempt  to  restore  the  house  of  Stewart  was 
abandoned  a  few  weeks  later,  and  the  Highlanders  returned  home. 
Robert  Stewart  was  a  second  time  attainted,  and  went  abroad. 


At  the  battle  of  Sheriffmuir  the  pipers  of  the  clan  played  the 
March  of  the  Stewarts,  and  hence  it  became  known  among  the  Perth- 
shire Stewarts  as  the  Sherra'muir  March.  According  to  the  traditions 
of  the  clan,  this  march  was  played  alike  when  they  were  marching  to 
battle,  and  in  honour  of  a  victory.  Particular  mention  is  made  of  its 
having  been  played  when  Donald-nan-ord  defeated  the  Earl  of  Men- 
teith  as  the  Stewarts  were  returning  from  the  battle  of  Pinkie  in  1547, 
and  also  at  Inverlochy,  Sheriffmuir,  and  Prestonpans,  and  it  was  recog- 
nised as  the  march  peculiarly  appertaining  to  the  Stewarts,  and  played 
on  all  their  incursions  and  forays.  It  is  difficult  to  say  when  the  Gaelic 
words  of  the  present  accompaniment  were  composed,  as,  in  accordance 
with  Highland  custom,  the  clansmen  were  in  the  habit  of  marching, 
during  the  intervals  of  pipe  music,  to  their  own  singing,  and  of  impro- 
vising words  as  they  stepped  gaily  along.  The  music,  as  played  by 
the  Perthshire  Stewarts,  assumed,  in  course  of  time,  a  somewhat 
different  arrangement.  Both  versions,  with  translations  of  the  Gaelic 
words,  are  given  at  the  close  of  the  history  of  the  main  stem  of 
Appin. 

It  would  appear  that  the  clan  took  part  in  the  attempt  made  by 
Lord  Seaforth  and  Lord  Tullibardine  in  1719  for  the  cause  of  the 
Stewarts,  a  notice  of  which  will  be  found  at  page  141.  No  evidence, 
however,  exists  to  show  that  the  chief  himself  returned  from  abroad  to 
share  in  it ;  indeed,  from  all  contemporaneous  accounts,  it  would  appear 
that  but  few  chiefs  of  clans  did  so.  Duncan  Stewart,  M.A.,  in  his  book 
written  in  1730,  but  not  published  till  1739,  records  Robert  as  still  liv- 
ing, but  for  obvious  reasons  makes  as  little  allusion  as  possible  to  poli- 
tical matters,  which,  at  the  very  time  of  publication,  were  again  exciting 
an  all-absorbing  interest  in  the  Highlands.  Ardsheal's  commission  as 
colonel  was  signed  in  the  year  of  the  publication  of  the  history ;  and 
there  is  thus  little  doubt  that  Robert's  death  had  occurred  between 
1730  and  1739,  though  the  destruction  of  the  Appin  MSS.  leaves  the 
exact  date  in  doubt. 


Robert  Stewart  married,  first,  a  daughter  of  MacLeod  of  MacLeod, 
by  whom  he  had  issue  :  Duncan,  who  died  at  school ;  Mary,  married  to 
Lachlan  Maclachlan  of  Maclachlan  ;  and  Anne,  married  to  Alexander 
Macdonald  of  Glencoe.  He  married,  secondly,  Anne,  daughter  of  Sir 
Duncan  Campbell  of  Lochnell,  by  whom  he  had  issue,  one  son,  Dugald, 
who  succeeded  him,  and  six  daughters  :  Isabel,  married  to  Donald 
Macdonald  of  Kinloch  Muidart ;  Janet,  married  to  Alastair  Mac- 
donald, eighteenth  of  Keppoch,  who  fell  at  Culloden  ;  Margaret,  mar- 
ried to  the  Rev.  John  Stewart ;  Katharine,  married  to  Alexander 
Stewart,  eighth  of  Invernahyle  ;  Anne,  who  died  unmarried  ;  and  Jean, 
who  died  young. 

Dugald  Stewart,  tenth  of  Appin,  to  whom  the  estate  was  restored, 
was  a  boy  of  tender  years  when  Prince  Charles  unfurled  the  Royal 
Standard  in  Glenfinlas  in  1745,  and  the  clan  was  consequently  led  by 
the  Tutor,  Charles  Stewart,  fifth  of  Ardsheal.  President  Forbes  in 
1 740  estimated  the  number  of  men  that  would  follow  the  Chief  of  Appin 
at  three  hundred,  and  he  repeated  that  estimate  in  his  report  to  the 
Government  in  1 744 ;  but,  with  their  followers,  they  now  numbered 
about  four  hundred  broadswords.  We  shall  not  here  give  any  history 
of  the  fortunes  of  the  clan  during  the  campaign  of  1 745-6,  as  the  account 
belongs  more  properly  to  the  notice  of  Ardsheal,  who  commanded  them 
with  credit  and  honour. 

Before,  however,  concluding  the  notice  of  Dugald,  the  last  of  the 
male  descendants  of  Duncan,  sixth  of  Appin,  it  may  be  proper  to  give 
here  an  account  of  the  formation  of  the  clan  regiments  in  battle,  which 
accounts  for  the  very  heavy  loss  of  gentlemen  which  the  Stewarts 
sustained  at  Culloden.  Every  regiment  or  clan  was  commanded  by  the 
chief,  if  of  sufficient  age,  as  colonel.  The  eldest  cadet  was  lieutenant- 
colonel,  and  the  next  was  major.  Some  clans  in  1 745  had  the  youngest 
cadet  lieutenant-colonel,  but  this  was  looked  upon  as  an  innovation  of 
the  established  principle.  Each  company  had  two  captains,  two  lieu- 
tenants, and  ensigns,  and  the  first  rank  was  composed  of  gentlemen. 


who  were  all  provided  with  targets,  and  were  otherwise  better  armed 
than  the  rear.  In  the  day  of  battle  each  company  furnished  two  of 
their  best  men  as  a  guard  to  the  chief,  and  in  their  choice  consanguinity 
was  always  considered.  The  chief  was  posted  in  the  centre  of  the 
column  beside  the  colours,  and  he  stood  between  two  brothers,  cousins- 
german,  or  other  relations.  The  common  men  were  also  disposed  with 
regard  to  their  relationship,  the  father,  the  son,  and  the  brother 
standing  beside  each  other.  The  effect  which  this  "  order  of  nature  " 
must  have  had  in  stimulating  the  combatants  to  deeds  of  valour 
can  be  easily  perceived.  It  did  not  escape  the  notice  of  the  observant 
Tacitus. 

Dugald,  last  baron  of  Appin,  married  Mary  Mackenzie,  by  whom 
he  had  one  daughter,  Anna,  married  to  David  Loch  of  Over  Carnbee, 
an  eminent  merchant  in  Leith.  Having  no  male  issue,  Dugald  sold  in 
1765  the  estate  of  Appin  to  Mr  Seton  of  Touch,  and  died  in  1769. 
The  representation  of  the  Stewarts  of  Lorn  and  Appin  then  devolved 
upon  the  head  of  the  family  of  Ardsheal,  descended  from  John,  second 
son  of  John,  fifth  baron  of  Appin. 

David  Loch's  estate  of  Over  Carnbee  is  in  Fife,  and  in  the  account 
of  "  The  East  Neuk  of  Fife,"  written  by  the  Rev.  Walter  Wood,  D.D., 
we  find  at  p.  219 — "In  1780  died  the  proprietor  of  Over  Carnbee, 
David  Loch,  who  was  long  a  merchant  of  eminence  in  Leith  ;  and  in 
1776  was  by  the  Trustees  for  fisheries,  manufactures,  and  improvements, 
appointed  inspector-general  of  the  woollen  manufactures  of  Scotland,  on 
which  he  published  an  essay,  and  afterwards  inspector-general  of 
fisheries.  In  1774  he  was  an  unsuccessful  candidate  for  the  representa- 
tion of  Edinburgh.  His  son  John  left  a  daughter,  Jean,  married  to 
Alexander  Murray,  &amp;c."  In  a  marginal  note,  Dr  Wood  adds,  "  David 
Loch  married  Anna  Stewart,  the  last  in  direct  line  of  the  family  of 
Appin,  who  died  in  1772." 

The  badges  of  the  Stewarts  were  the  Darag,  or  oak,  and  also  the 
Cluaran,  or  thistle,  the  present  national  badge.     The  adoption  of  the 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


former,  as  not  being  an  evergreen,  was  regarded  by  the  Highlanders  as 
an  emblem  of  the  fate  of  the  Royal  House. 


The  tartan  worn  by  the 
Stewarts  of  Appin  is  the  well- 
known  pattern  commonly  called 
the  Royal  Stewart,  and  the  pro- 
portions of  colours  given  in  the 
margin  are  taken  from  Logan's 
"  Scottish  Gael." 

A  web  of  tartan  is  two  feet 
two  inches  wide,  at  least  within 
half  an  inch  more  or  less,  so 
that  the  size  of  the  patterns 
makes  no  difference  in  the  scale. 
Commencing  at  the  head  of  the 
cloth,  the  depth  of  the  colours 
is  stated  throughout  a  square, 
on  which  the  scale  must  be  re- 
versed or  gone  through  again 
to  the  commencement.  There 
is,  it  may  be  observed,  a  parti- 
cular colour  in  some  patterns 
which  can  scarcely  admit  of  de- 
scription, but  which  is  known  to 
the  Hig^hlanders. 


The  following  is  the  music  of  the  Stewarts'  March  now  usually 
played  in  Argyllshire,  and  the  words  are  translated  by  the  Rev.  Alex- 
ander Stewart  of  Nether  Lochaber,  from  the  Argyll  version  of  the  song, 
as  said  to  have  been  sung  in  1644  when  the  clan  and  the  Stewarts 
from  Athole  marched  to  Inverlochy : —

THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


STEWARTS'  MARCH,  OR  SHERIFFMUIR. 


We  will  take  the  good  old  way, 
We  will  take  the  good  old  way, 
We'll  take  and  keep  the  good  old  way, 
Let  them  say  their  will,  O  ! 

Let  Macintyres  say  what  they  may, 
Let  Macintyres  say  what  they  may. 
We'll  take  and  keep  the  good  old  way, 
Let  them  say  their  will,  O  ! 

'Tis  up  the  steep  and  heathery  Ben, 
Adown  the  bonny  winding  glen. 
We  march  a  band  of  loyal  men, 

Let  them  say  their  will,  O  ! 


We  will  march  adown  Glencoe, 
We  will  march  adown  Glencoe, 
By  the  Ferry  we  will  go. 

Let  them  say  their  will,  O  1 

To  Glengarry  and  Lochiel, 
Loyal  hearts  with  arms  of  steel. 
These  will  back  us  in  the  field. 

Let  them  say  their  will,  O  ! 

Cluny  shall  come  down  the  brae, 
Keppoch  bold  shall  lead  the  way. 
Toss  thine  antlers  Caber  Feigh, 

Let  them  say  their  will,  O  ! 


Forward,  sons  of  bold  Rob  Roy  ; 
Stewarts,  conflict  is  your  joy  ! 
We'll  stand  together  pour  le  Roi, 

Let  them  say  their  will,  O  ! 

In  the  Gaelic  words  the  march  or  lyric  begins— 

Gabhaidh  sinn  an  rathad  mbr, 
Gabhaidh  sinn  an  rathad  mbr, 
Gabhaidh  sinn  an  rathad  mor, 

01c  no  math  le  ckch  e. 

The  arrangement  of  the  music  commonly  played  in  Perthshire  is 
as  follows,  and  the  words  are  translated  by  Mr  Charles  Stewart  of 
Tighn'duin,  from  the  words  held  by  the  Athole  Stewarts  to  be  the 
ancient  version  : — 


GABHAIDH   SINN   AN   RATHAD   MOR. 


We  will  up  and  march  away, 
We  will  up  and  march  away, 
We  will  up  and  march  away. 

Daring  let  of  all  men. 
The  heath-clad  Ben  we'll  soon  ascend. 
Through  Glen  Laoigh  we'll  soon  descend. 
Our  points  of  steel  we'll  swiftly  send 
Thro'  every  loon  that  bars  us. 
We  will  up,  &amp;c. 


O'er  the  hills  we'll  speed  along, 
Through  Glencoe  unwearied  on, 
Our  king  the  burden  of  our  song, 
Asking  leave  of  no  man. 

We  will  up,  &amp;c. 

To  Glengarry  and  Lochiel, 
Ever  with  us,  true  and  leal ; 
Keppoch,  too,  who  seeks  our  weal, 
Is  there  in  spite  of  all  men. 

We  will  up,  &amp;c. 

Macphersons  come,  in  deeds  not  small, 
M'Kenzies  also  at  our  call, 
Whose  battle-frenzy  will  appal 
And  fill  our  foes  with  awe  then. 
We  will  up,  &amp;c. 

Macgregors,  fierce  when  man  to  man, 
Join  with  the  Royal  Stewart  clan  ; 
Blow  up  the  pipes,  march  proudly  on, 
Daring  let  of  all  men. 

We  will  up,  &amp;c. 


ARDSHEAL. 

THE  male  line  of  Duncan  Stewart,  sixth  baron  of  Appin,  failing  in  the  person  of 
Dugald,  tenth  baron,  the  representation  of  the  family  devolved  upon  the  descend- 
ants of  John  Stewart  of  Ardsheal,  immediate  younger  brother  of  Duncan,  and  to  the 
descent  of  the  family  of  Ardsheal  we  now  turn. 

John  Stewart,  first  of  Ardsheal,  was  second  son  of  John,  fifth  baron  of  Appin,  bom 
of  his  second  wife,  a  daughter  of  Macdonald  of  Muidart.  He  received  from  his  father 
the  lands  of  Ardsheal,  a  name  derived  from  the  two  Gaelic  words,  Ard-seallaidh,  the 
height  or  point  of  view,  a  name  rendered  very  appropriate  to  the  locality  by  the  eminence 
behind  the  mansion.  It  was  at  that  time  the  custom  for  young  men  of  family  to  be 
trained  to  arms  and  courtesy  in  the  households  of  the  great  nobles.  After  receiving  the 
best  education  the  times  could  afford,  John's  name  and  blood  obtained  for  him  the 
privilege  of  entering  the  household  of  the  king's  cousin,  Lodovick,  second  Duke  of 
Lennox.  The  high  appointments  held  by  the  Duke  as  High  Chamberlain  and  Admiral 
of  Scotland,  and  Ambassador  to  France  in  1601,  brought  Ardsheal  much  to  Court,  and 
he  became  a  highly  accomplished  gentleman.  About  this  time  his  relative  and  neighbour, 
Lochiel,  was  the  ward  in  chivalry  of  the  Marquess  of  Argyll. 

John  Stewart  married  Mary,  daughter  of  Macdonald  of  Keppoch,  Alastair  n'  an  Cleas, 
and  left  two  sons. 

1.  Duncan,  his  successor. 

2.  Alexander. 

Duncan  Stewart,  second  of  Ardsheal,  succeeded  his  father.  An  old  family  MS. 
informs  us  that  "he  was  steadfast  in  his  loyalty  to  Charles  I.,  and  served  in  1644  and 
1645  as  an  officer  of  the  Appin  regiment  with  the  Marquis  of  Montrose,  acquiring  the 
favour  of  his  heroic  general  by  his  zeal  in  the  royal  cause,  and  by  his  active  intelligence." 

Duncan  Stewart  married,  first,  Anne,  daughter  of  John  Stewart  of  Lettershuna, 
brother  of  Donald  Stewart,  fifth  of  Invemahyle,  and  had  two  sons  and  four  daughters — 

1.  John,  his  successor. 

2.  Alexander,  who  was  killed,  as  before-mentioned,  at  the  attack  on  the  church  of 

Dunkeld,  after  the  battle  of  Killiecrankie,  having  married  a  daughter  of  Alex- 
ander Stewart  of  Ballachelish,  by  whom  he  had  three  sons — 


John  Stewart  of  Acham,  who  had  by  his  wife  Ann,   daughter  of 
Campbell  of  Dunstaffnage — 

1.  Alexander   Stewart  of  Acham,  who  had  two  sons,  both 

killed  at  Culloden. 

2.  John  Glas  Stewart,  who  acquired  the  estate  of  Benmore  in 

Perthshire,  and  who  was  killed,  with  his  two  nephews  above 
mentioned,  at  Culloden,  leaving,  by  his  first  wife,  Margaret, 
daughter  of  John,  fourth  of  Ardsheal,  a  son  and  daughter — 

1.  John  Stewart,  who  acquired  the  estate  of  Glen- 

buckie  by  his  marriage  with  Mary,  daughter  of 
Duncan  Stewart  of  Glenbuckie,  and  died  without 
issue.  The  Stewarts  of  Glenbuckie  were  descended 
from  John,  second  son  of  William  Stewart  of  Bal 
dorran,  grandson  of  Lord  James  Stewart,  who  was 
son  of  Murdoch,  second  Duke  of  Albany. 

2.  Elizabeth  Stewart,  afterwards  of  Glenbuckie,  who 

died  unmarried. 
By  his  second  marriage  with  Catharine,  daughter  of  M'Nab 
of  Innischewan,  John  Glas  Stewart  had — 

3.  Duncan,  a  captain  in  the  Western  Regt.  of  Fencible 

men,  who  aftenvards  acquired,  from  his  half-sister 
Elizabeth,  the  estate  of  Glenbuckie.  His  first  wife, 
Susannah,  daughter  of  Captain  Campbell  of  Kilberry, 
having  died  without  issue,  he  married,  secondly, 
Margaret,  second  daughter  of  Duncan  Stewart, 
SLxth  of  Ardsheal,  by  whom  he  had  issue  two  sons 
and  daughters— 

I.  John  Lorn  Stewart  of  Coll,  who  died  in  1878, 
leaving  issue  by  his  wife,  Mary  Campbell — 
I.  Duncan  Stewart,  Commander  R.N.,  who 
married  Ferooza,  daughter  of  the  Right  Hon- 
ourable Sir  John  M'Neill,  G.C.B.,  and  has 
issue — Lorn  M'Neill  Stewart,  Florence,  Archi- 
bald who  died  in  infancy,  Duncan  Archibald, 
Elisabeth  Mary,  Charles  Edward,  Crawford, 
and  Ferooza  Stewart ;  2.  Archibald,  died  un- 
married ;  3.  John  Lorn  Stewart  of  Coll,  Major 
1 8th   Hussars;  also  4.  Mary,  married   to   D. 


Fox  Tarratt  of  Ellary,  with  issue — Joseph  Fox, 
William  Archibald,  and  Mary  Caroline  Camp- 
bell Tarratt ;  and  5.  Helen,  married  to  William 
A.  Campbell  of  Ormsary,  and  has  issue. 
2.  Duncan   Stewart,  who   went   to    Lima,    and 
married  a  Spanish  lady,  sister  of  the  wife  of 
his  maternal  uncle  William,  and  had  issue — 
Duncan,  William,  and  Carlos. 
2.   Duncan  Stewart,  second  son  of  Alexander  Stewart,  killed  at  Dunkeld 
in  1689,  was  thrice  married.     By  his  first  marriage  he  had  one  son, 
who  survived  him ;  and  by  his  second  wife,  Margaret,  daughter  of 
Donald  Maclean  of  Ardgour,  he  had  four  sons — 

1.  Allan,  of  whom  was  the  Rev.  John  Stewart  of  Inverness. 

2.  Duncan,  killed  at  Dunkeld. 

3.  James,  who  died  unmarried. 

4.  William,  who  left  issue,  now  extinct. 

Also  a  daughter,   Moir,  married   to   John   Stewart,  sixth    of 
Fasnacloich. 
Duncan's  third  mfe  was  a  daughter  of  Maclean  of  Coll,  but  by  her 
he  had  no  issue.    From  Donald  Maclean  of  Ardgour,  Duncan  got  a  char- 
ter, to  be  seen  among  the  confirmations  under  the  Great  Seal,  in  the 
Register  House  at  Edinburgh,  of  the  lands  of  Glengalmadale  and  Stron. 
Duncan  Stewart,  second  of  Ardsheal,  had  also  four  daughters — i.  ,  married 

to  Macdonald  of  Killiechonat ;  2.  ,  married  to  John  Stewart,  third  of  Ballache- 

lish  ;  3.  Isabel,  married  to  James  Stewart,  fifth  of  Fasnacloich ;  and  4.  ,  married 

to  Maclachlan  of  Cregan. 

John  Stewart,  third  of  Ardsheal,  succeeded  his  father  Duncan. 
The  following  memorandum,  found  amongst  the  Ardsheal  papers,  illustrates  the  state 
of  the  laws  and  customs  in  Scotland  at  that  period  : — 

"Upon  the  forfeitry  of  the  Earl  of  Argyll  in  the  1685,  Sir  James  Stewart,  Sheriff, 
afterwards  Earl,  of  Bute,  that  was  married  to  Sir  George  M'Kenzie's  daughter,  Lord  Ad- 
vocate to  King  James  VII.,  got  a  gift  of  the  estate  of  Barbreck,  which  was  forfeited  as 
vassal  of  Argyll,  but  Bute  finding  it  very  troublesome  to  apprehend  possession  of  that 
estate  in  the  heart  of  the  Argyllshire  Campbells,  applied  to  John  Stewart  (third)  of  Ard- 
sheal for  his  assistance  to  facilitate  his  entry  to  these  lands.  Ardsheal  accordingly  having 
the  command  of  the  country  in  Appin's  minority,  sent  a  number  of  armed  men,  com- 
manded by  his  own  brothers,  and  carried  off  a  considerable  number  of  cattle  from  that 
estate  in  lieu  of  the  rents  ;  and  afterwards,  in  the  year  1687,  Ardsheal  in  person  appre- 


hended  possession  of  the  Barbreck  estate,  and  carried  with  him  Achnacone,  and  a  number 
of  the  Commoners  who  occupied  farms  upon  the  estate,  till  the  Revolution  in  November 
1688.  In  February  1689,  they  were  obliged  to  abandon  it  and  return  home  with  what 
they  could  carry  of  their  effects,  suffering  considerable  loss."  The  Laird  of  Barbreck  raised 
an  action  at  law  against  Ardsheal  for  loss  and  damage  caused  by  carrying  off  the  cattle, 
and  it  was  not  finally  settled  till  1742,  Ardsheal  being  held  not  liable  for  any  repayment. 

As  nearest  of  kin  to  Robert,  ninth  baron  of  Appin,  then  a  minor,  John  Stewart  of 
Ardsheal  was  Tutor,  and  leader  of  the  clan,  an  honour  which,  for  the  like  reason,  devolved 
on  his  grandson,  who  was  Tutor  to  Dugald,  last  of  Appin,  in  1745.  In  this  capacity  he 
took  an  active  part  in  raising  the  Western  Clans  to  meet  Dundee,  the  Appin  Stewarts  and 
the  Macnaghtons  being,  according  to  Macaulay,  the  only  clans  under  arms  to  meet 
Dundee  when  he  arrived  at  Inverlochy  in  i6Sg,  to  confer  with  Lochiel.  It  was  for  this 
reason  that  he  had  withdrawn  his  men  from  the  occupation  of  Barbreck.  In  the  Scots  Acts 
of  Parliament  of  1689,  we  find  that  John  Campbell  of  Airds,  no  doubt  with  the  Barbreck 
episode  fresh  in  his  recollection,  presented  a  petition,  stating  that  the  Tutor  of  Appin 
was  a  very  active  man  against  all  that  bore  the  name  of  Campbell,  and  had  seized  upon 
the  castle  of  Eilan  Stalcaire,  which  ought  not  to  be  in  the  hands  of  such  a  disaffected 
person ;  whereupon  the  Parliament  gave  the  said  John  Campbell  authority  to  summon 
certain  companies  of  soldiers  to  expel  the  Tutor  and  his  men,  if  they  still  refused  to  evac- 
uate the  castle  peaceably.  Ardsheal  had  seized  the  castle  for  King  James  as  Tutor  of 
his  chief,  who  was  still  hereditary  keeper  of  the  castle  for  the  king,  although  the  actual 
proprietorship  had,  as  has  been  before  narrated,  passed  into  the  hands  of  the  family  of 
Campbell  of  Airds.  On  the  nth  of  May  1690,  Colonel  Hill,  governor  of  Inverlochy 
Castle,  wTOte  to  the  Laird  of  Weem  (Menzies)  enjoining  him  to  be  very  strict  with  the 
Tutor  of  Appin,  as  he  might  be  "  apt  to  be  blowne  up  with  storyes,  and  might  think  to 
stand  out  still."  On  the  28th  of  August  in  the  same  year.  Colonel  Hill  again  wrote 
Menzies  that  the  Tutor  still  held  Castle  Stalcaire.  From  Sir  Ewen  Cameron's  Memoirs, 
we  learn  that  Ardsheal  continued  to  hold  Castle  Stalcaire  against  the  main  body  of  "  Ar- 
gile's  men  till  the  October  following,  when  he  yielded  on  very  honourable  terms." 

It  is  doubtful  if  Ardsheal  and  the  main  body  of  the  Appin  men  were  present  at  the 
battle  of  KilUecrankie.  There  is  evidence  enough  to  show  that  the  young  chief,  Robert 
of  Appin,  was  there  with  a  little  over  a  hundred  of  the  clan,  and  the  probability  seems  to 
be,  that  Ardsheal  and  the  main  body  did  not  arrive  till  two  days  after  the  battle.  None 
of  the  witnesses  examined  by  the  Scots  Parliament  deposed  that  they  saw  him  with  Dun- 
dee's army  before  the  battle,  and  James  Osbume  swore  that  he  saw  the  Tutor  join  before 
they  went  to  Dunkeld,  and  that  he  was  with  them  afterwards  till  the  army  dispersed. 

John  Stewart,  third  of  Ardsheal,  married  Anne,  daughter  of  Colin  Campbell  of 
Lochnell,  and  had  issue— 


1.  John,  who  succeeded  him. 

2.  Duncan. 

3.  Allan. 

4.  James. 

Also  three  daughters — i.  Anne,  married  first  to  Lachlan  Maclachlan  of  Fassifem,  by 
whom  she  had  issue,  and  secondly  to  Dougal  Campbell  of  Glenfeochan,  by  whom  she  had 
five  sons ;  2.  Janet,  married  to  John  Stewart,  eighth  of  Glenbuckie ;  3.  Isabel,  married 
to  Duncan,  son  of  James  Stewart,  fifth  of  Fasnacloich,  and  had  issue. 

John  Stewart,  fourth  of  Ardsheal,  succeeded  his  father.  He  was  summoned  to 
Edinburgh  in  1 7 14,  with  his  chief,  Robert  Stewart  of  Appin,  to  give  security  that  he  would 
not  join  in  any  rising  in  favour  of  the  Chevalier  de  St  George.  He  did  not  obey  the 
summons,  and  served  with  the  Appin  regiment  under  the  Earl  of  Mar  at  the  battle  of 
Sheriffmuir  in  17 15.  His  estates  were  consequently  forfeited,  but  were  restored  in  1717. 
He  married  Elizabeth,  daughter  of  Charles  Stewart,  eighth  of  Ballechin  in  Athole,  and 
had  issue — 

1.  Charles,  who  succeeded  him. 

2.  John. 

Also  five  daughters — i.  Anne,  married  to  Alexander  Stewart,  fourth  of  Ballachelish  ; 
2.  Helen,  married  to  Allan  Cameron  of  Callart ;  3.  Isabel,  married  to  Alexander  Mac- 
donald  of  Glencoe ;  4.  Margaret,  married  to  John  Glas  Stewart  of  Benmore ;  5.  Janet, 
who  died  unmarried. 

Charles  Stewart,  fifth  of  Ardsheal,  succeeded  his  father.  He  was  a  man  of  great 
personal  strength,  and  accounted  one  of  the  best  swordsmen  in  the  Highlands.  In  an 
encounter  with  Rob  Roy  in  Balquidder  he  wounded  the  celebrated  freebooter,  who  threw 
his  sword  into  Lochvoil,  exclaiming  that  it  was  the  first  time  it  had  failed  him,  and  that 
Ardsheal  was  the  first  man  who  had  drawn  blood  from  him.  It  is  said  that  the  result  of 
this  combat  aided  him  in  his  suit  for  the  hand  of  his  future  wife,  the  daughter  of  Haldane 
of  Lanrick. 

No  records  remain  of  Ardsheal's  life  before  1739,  as  most  of  the  family  papers  were 
destroyed  or  lost  on  the  sacking  of  the  house  at  Ardsheal  on  the  night  of  the  isth  to  i6th 
December  1746,  as  will  be  afterwards  related.  It  is  known,  however,  that  he  was  an 
enthusiastic  Jacobite,  keeping  up  an  active  correspondence  with  the  Court  of  the 
Chevalier  at  Fontainebleau  and  Rome,  and  that  in  1739  he  received  a  commission  as 
Colonel  from  King  James,  which  is  still  in  possession  of  the  family,  and  of  which  the 
following  is  a  copy  : — 

"  James  the  Eight,  By  the  Grace  of  God  King  of  Scotland,  England,  France,  and 
Ireland,  Defender  of  the  Faith,  etc. — To  our  Trusty  and  well-beloved  Charles  Stewart  of 
Ardsheal,  Esquire,  Greeting.    We,  reposing  especial  Trust  and  Confidence  in  your  loyalty. 


courage,  aiid  good  conduct,  Do  hereby  constitute  and  appoint  you  a  Colonel  in  our 
Forces,  and  to  take  your  rank  in  our  Army  from  the  date  hereof.  You  are  therefore 
carefully  and  diligently  to  Discharge  the  Duty  and  Trust  of  Colonel  aforesaid,  by  doing 
and  performing  everything  belonging  thereto  :  And  We  hereby  Require,  all  and  sundry, 
our  Forces  to  Respect  and  obey  you  as  such,  and  yourself  to  observe  and  follow  all  such 
Orders,  Directions,  and  Commands  as  you  shall  from  time  to  time  receive  from  as,  our 
General  and  Commander-in-Chief  of  our  Forces  for  the  time  being,  or  any  other  your 
Superior  Officer,  according  to  the  Rules  and  Discipline  of  War :  In  pursuance  of  the 
Trust  reposed  in  you,  Given  at  our  Court  at  Rome,  This  20th  Day  of  May  1739,  In 
the  38th  year  of  Our  Reign.  J.  R." 

Charles  Stewart  of  Ardsheal,  being  a  man  of  energy  and  ability,  and  Tutor  to  the 
Chief,  who  was  a  minor,  took,  together  with  Lochiel  and  Glengarry,  a  leading  part  for 
years  in  the  correspondence  with  Prince  Charles  as  to  his  prospects  of  success  in  the 
event  of  his  coming  to  Scotland  to  assert  by  arms  his  father's  right  to  the  Crown.  In 
1745  Ardsheal,  at  the  head  of  the  Appin  regiment,  joined  Prince  Charles  Edward  at  Low 
Bridge  in  the  Great  Glen.  In  a  narrative,  written  apparently  soon  after  1746,  Andrew 
Henderson  says :  "  The  Stewarts  of  Appin,  ever  zealous  for  the  royal  cause,  joined  the 
Chevalier  under  Stewart  of  Ardsheal,  a  gentleman  of  good  parts,  though  misapplied." 
Lord  Elcho,  one  of  the  attainted  lords,  says  in  his  account  of  the  campaign,  that  Stewart 
of  Ardsheal  was  one  of  the  Council  who  met  with  Prince  Charles  every  morning. 

In  a  memorandum  as  to  the  Highland  clans,  sent  to  the  King  of  France  when  he  was 
computing  the  chances  of  the  success  of  an  expedition  to  Scotland,  and  the  number  of 
men  who  would  take  the  field  in  support  of  the  Royal  Stuarts,  we  find  the  following  :— 
"The  Stewarts  of  Appin  and  M'Naughtons  have  still  been  loyal  to  the  Kings  Charies  I.  and 
II.,  and  King  James  VII.,  and  were  in  the  fields  for  them.  They  may  raise,  of  very  good 
men,  500."  The  Appin  regiment  seems  generally  to  have  been  a  little  over  300  men, 
including  those  of  the  name  of  Stewart,  and  their  retainers  who  occupied  crofts  under  them 
in  Appin,  chiefly  of  the  names  of  M'Coll,  Carmichael,  M'Combich,  M'Innes,  M'Lea  or 
Livingstone,  M'Intyre,  and  M'Cormack  or  Buchanan.  Their  staunch  allies  the  M'Larens 
also  sent  a  contingent,  which  formed  a  valuable  part  of  the  regiment.  In  a  "  Life  of  the 
Duke  of  Cumberiand  "  they  are  only  stated  at  zoo  strong  when  they  marched  southward 
from  Edinburgh.  This,  however,  is  a  low  estimate,  as  in  no  other  account  are  they  put 
at  so  small  a  number.  In  the  list  of  Prince  Charles'  troops  in  November  1745,  are  "  the 
Appin  men,  360,  under  Stewart  of  Ardsheal." 

At  the  battle  of  Preston  Pans,  on  21st  September  1745,  the  Camerons  formed  the 
extreme  left  of  the  Highland  army.  Next  to  them,  and  opposed  to  Lascelles'  regiment, 
were  the  Stewarts  of  Appin,  supported  by  120  of  their  neighbours  and  hereditary  friends 
the  Macdonalds  of  Glencoe,  whose  chief  was  brother-in-law  to  Ardsheal.     The  Camerons 


and  Stewarts  were  drawn  up  somewhat  in  advance  of  the  clans  on  their  right,  and  were 
thus  the  first  to  encounter  the  enemy.  They  were  opposed  to  Sir  John  Cope's  artillery, 
which  they  captured,  Stewart  of  Invemahyle  taking  prisoner  Colonel  Whitefoord  after  he 
had  fired  off  five  of  the  six  field  pieces  with  his  own  hand.  Four  officers  of  Prince 
Charles'  army  were  killed,  and  amongst  them  was  "  Captain  Robert  Stewart  of  Ardsheal's 
battalion." 

On  the  20th  December  1745,  Macpherson  of  Clunie  wrote  to  a  friend,  describing  the 
engagement  of  the  rear  of  the  Highland  army  with. the  Duke  of  Cumberland's  troops  at 
Clifton  three  days  previously.  He  says  that  the  Duke  took  them  by  surprise,  accompanied 
by  more  than  3000  horse,  and  "  when  he  appeared  there  happened  to  be  no  more  of  our 
army  at  hand  than  Glengarry's,  Stewart  of  Appin's,  and  my  own  regiment.  Glengarry's 
regiment  was  planted  at  the  back  of  a  stone  wall  on  our  right,  the  Appin  regiment  in  the 
centre,  and  mine  on  the  left,  lining  a  hedge."  The  Duke's  troops  were  repulsed  with 
considerable  loss,  the  Stewarts,  Clunie  says,  coming  off  without  the  loss  of  a  man. 

At  the  battle  of  Falkirk,  17th  January  1746,  the  Appin  men,  300  in  number,  were  in 
the  centre  of  the  first  line,  according  to  Charles'  History,  but  Home's  sketch  of  the  field, 
which  is  more  likely  to  be  correct,  places  them  on  the  extreme  left,  next  the  Camerons. 
They  were  one  of  the  few  regiments  charged  by  Hawley's  dragoons,  whom  they  decisively 
repulsed.  Ardsheal  was  one  of  the  chiefs  who,  after  a  Council  of  War  on  the  29th 
January,  signed  a  recommendation  to  Prince  Charles  to  continue  his  retreat  to  the  north 
from  Falkirk. 

At  the  battle  of  Culloden,  i6th  April  1746,  the  first  line  of  the  Highland  army, 
enumerating  from  right  to  left,  consisted  of  the  Athole  men,  the  Camerons,  Stewarts  of 
Appin,  Frasers,  M'Intoshes,  Maclachlans,  Macleans,  Roy  Stewart's  regiment,  Farquhar- 
son's,  Clanranald,  Keppoch,  and  Glengarry.  The  position  assigned  to  the  Macdonalds  on 
the  left,  instead  of  on  the  right,  an  honour  which  they  claimed  to  be  theirs  by  hereditary 
right,  contributed  greatly  to  the  loss  of  this  battle,  as  the  pride  of  the  haughty  clan  was 
deeply  wounded.  The  right  wing — the  Athole,  Lochiel,  and  Appin  regiments — were 
opposed  by  Barrel's  and  Monro's  regiments,  which  were  supported  on  the  left  flank  by 
cavalry,  and  on  the  right  by  artillery ;  Woolf's  and  Blakeney's  regiments  being  drawn  up 
in  two  lines  in  rear  of  the  interval  between  Monro's  and  Burrell's.  All  accounts  of  the 
battle  state  that  the  regiments  on  the  right  of  the  Prince's  army  rushed  to  the  attack  with 
heroic  valour.  The  Historical  Geography  of  the  Clans  of  Scotland  says  that  Lord  George 
Murray  on  the  right,  seeing  that  his  division  could  be  restrained  no  longer,  ordered  them 
to  advance,  which  they  did  with  a  shout.  In  spite  of  the  shower  of  grape  shot  which  met 
their  advance,  the  clansmen  pressed  on,  and  broke  through  Monro's  and  Barrel's 
regiments,  capturing  two  cannon.  Not  content  with  this,  they  continued  their  advance 
till  it  was  checked  by  the  second  line,  which  was  drawm  up  as  if  to  repel  cavalry,  the  first

rank  kneeling,  the  second  stooping  over  the  first,  and  the  third  standing  upright.  Such  a 
destructive  fire  was  poured  upon  the  Highlanders,  that  their  advance  was  checked,  and 
the  survivors  compelled  to  retire  ;  but  so  determined  had  been  the  attack,  and  so  vigorous 
and  effective  the  repulse,  that  the  Highlanders  were  found,  when  the  strife  was  over, 
heaped  on  each  other  three  and  four  deep. 

One,  who  signs  himself  "An  Eye  Witness  to  most  of  the  Facts,"  writing  in  1748, 
says  :  "  Those  on  the  right  (Stewarts  and  Camerons),  with  their  glittering  swords,  ran 
swiftly  on  the  cannon,  making  a  dreadful  huzza,  and  crying, '  Run  ye  dogs.'  They  broke 
between  the  grenadiers  of  Barrel  and  Monroe,  who  had  given  them  fire  when  at  the 
muzzles  of  their  guns.  When  within  two  yards  of  the  cannon  they  received  a  discharge 
of  cartridge  shot,  while  those  who  crowded  into  the  opening  made  by  the  havoc  received 
a  full  fire  from  the  centre  of  Bligh's.  They  who  survived  possessed  themselves  of  the 
cannon,  and  attacked  the  regiments  sword  in  hand  ;  but  Wolf's  and  Fleming's  wheeled  to 
the  left  of  Barrel's,  with  Bligh's  and  Semple's,  and  made  such  a  continued  fire  on  their 
front  and  flank,  that  nearly  all  the  right  wing  which  broke  in  were  killed  or  wounded." 
In  his  account  of  the  battle  of  Culloden,  the  desperate  valour  of  the  clans  moved  Lord 
Mahon  out  of  his  usual  composure  to  an  unwonted  swell  of  sympathetic  eloquence. 
"  Nowhere,"  he  says,  "  not  by  their  forefathers  at  Bannockbum,  not  by  themselves  at 
Preston  and  Falkirk,  not  in  after  years,  when  discipline  had  raised  and  refined  the  valour 
of  their  sons,  not  on  the  shores  of  the  Nile,  not  on  that  other  field  of  victory,  where  their 
gallant  chief,  with  a  prophetic  shroud  (it  is  their  own  superstition)  high  on  his  breast, 
addressed  to  them  only  these  three  words,  '  Highlanders,  remember  Egypt ^ — not  in  those 
hours  of  triumph  and  glory  was  displayed  a  more  firm  and  resolute  bravery  than  now  in 
this  defeat  of  Culloden."  But  for  the  unfortunate  affront  to  the  numerous  and  gallant 
clan  of  the  Macdonalds  in  placing  them  on  the  left  wing,  in  place  of  on  the  right,  an 
honour  which  they  have  claimed  since  the  battle  of  Bannockbum,  the  disastrous  defeat 
might  have  been  a  victory.  Charles  puts  the  number  of  the  Appin  regiment  at  Culloden 
at  300,  and  Chambers  says  they  suffered  more  than  any  other  of  the  Highland  clans. 
Andrew  Henderson  writes  "  that  the  regiments  " — those  from  Athole,  Appin,  and  Lochiel, 
— "  opposed  to  Barrel  and  Monroe  broke  through  the  first  line  with  irresistible  fury,  but 
received  a  terrible  discharge  from  cannon  ;  they  possessed  themselves  of  the  guns,  but 
it  was  impossible  to  hold  them,  and  being  attacked  in  the  flank,  they  had  to  retreat." 
The  regimental  colour  borne  by  the  Stewarts  of  Appin  at  Culloden  is  still  in  the  possession 
of  the  head  of  the  Ballachelish  branch  of  the  family.  It  is  of  light  blue  silk,  with  a  yellow 
saltire,  or  cross  of  St  Andrew,  the  dimensions  being  5  feet  hoist,  with  a  fly  of  6  feet  7 
inches.  Its  gallant  bearer,  one  of  the  Ardsheal  family,  was  killed,  and  the  banner  is 
stained  with  his  blood.  It  bears  the  marks  of  having  been  torn  from  the  colour  staff, 
which  accords  with  MTan's  account  that,  when  the  standard-bearer  was  slain,  one  of  the

corps,  called  Mac  an  t-Iedh,  from  Morven,  tore  it  from  the  staff,  and  wrapping  it  round 
his  body,  made  good  his  retreat  from  the  field.  The  banner  thus  escaped  the  fate  of  those 
of  twelve  Highland  clans,  which  were  taken  at  Culloden,  and  burned  at  the  Market  Cross 
of  Edinburgh  on  the  6th  June  following. 

There  is  a  list  in  the  possession  of  Alexander  Stewart,  now  of  Achnacone,  of  the 
Appin  men  killed  and  wounded  at  Culloden,  of  which  the  following  is  an  abstract,  the 
detailed  list  being  given  in  the  appendix  : —

This  large  number  of  casualties  fully  justifies  Chambers'  remark  previously  quoted. 
The  number  of  officers  and  gentlemen  of  the  family  killed  and  wounded,  amounting  to 
forty-seven  out  of  a  total  of  between  fifty  and  sixty,  seems  quite  disproportionate  till  we 
recollect  the  order  of  battle  of  the  Highlanders,  previously  given.  The  proud  feeling  of 
kindred  with  "  Charlie,"  as  they  fondly  called  the  Prince,  would  also  lead  these  gentle- 
men to  venture  all  things  on  this  decisive  day. 

After  the  battle  of  Culloden  the  clan  dispersed,  and  though  Lochiel  and  Ardsheal 
endeavoured  to  rally  the  Western  clans,  and  hold  possession  of  Lochaber,  they  never 
drew  to  a  head  again.  Amongst  those  attainted  of  high  treason  on  the  8th  June  1 746, 
were  "  Stewart  of  Ardsheal,  and  the  other  officers  of  the  Stewarts."  Haldane  of  Lanrick 
and  his  sons,  who  served  in  the  campaign  as  major  and  captain  of  a  body  of  Perthshire 
horse,  were  also  attainted,  and  when  the  Act  of  Indemnity  was  passed  in  1747,  both  Ard- 
sheal and  his  friends  the  Haldanes  were  excepted  from  its  benefit.  Before  escaping  to 
France,  Ardsheal  wished  to  see  his  family,  and  succeeded  in  reaching  Appin,  where  he 


lay  concealed  in  a  cave,  still  called  Ardsheal's  cave,  on  the  hill  of  Ardsheal,  being  gener- 
ally supplied  with  food  by  a  little  maiden,  the  daughter  of  one  of  his  tenants,  who  daily 
drove  out  a  few  lambs  to  the  hill,  and  watched  her  opportunity  of  communicating  with  her 
hidden  chief.  The  district  was  occupied  by  English  soldiers,  and  the  peasantry  were  all 
acquainted  with  Ardsheal's  hiding-place,  but,  regardless  of  the  rewards  offered  for  his  cap- 
ture, they  were  faithful  to  the  trust  reposed  in  them.  After  a  few  weeks'  concealment  in 
the  cave,  Ardsheal  found  an  opportunity  of  escaping  to  France.  In  a  Scots  Magazine  of 
the  period,  we  find  a  paragraph  stating  that  on  the  17th  September  1746,  Stewart  of  Ard- 
sheal, and  four  other  gentlemen,  got  on  board  a  French  ship,  and  escaped  pursuit. 
Meanwhile  the  estate  had  been  confiscated  and  given  up  to  plunder,  though  the  hardships 
thus  brought  upon  Ardsheal's  wife  and  children,  seem,  from  the  following  letter,  to  have 
been  i"or  a  short  time  mitigated  by  the  humanity  of  the  officer  in  command  : — 

Appin,  May  2&lt;,t/i,  1746. 

"  Madam, 

"  Your  misfortune  and  the  unhappy  situation  Ardsheal  has  brought 
you,  and  your  innocent  children  into,  by  being  so  deeply  concerned  in  this  unjust  and 
unnatural  rebellion,  makes  my  heart  aik.  I  know  the  King  to  be  compassionate  and 
merciful.  I  know  the  brave  Duke  under  whose  command  and  orders  I  act,  to  have  as 
much  humanity  as  any  man  on  earth,  from  which  and  my  own  natural  inclination  I  have 
taken  the  liberty  of  ordering  back  your  Milk  Cows,  six  Wethers,  and  as  many  Lambs,  the 
men  whO;pretend  a  right  to  them  shall  be  paid.  I  have  taken  the  freedom  at  the  same  time 
of  ordering  two  Bolls  of  Meal  out  of  my  own  stores  to  be  left  here  for  you,  which  I  desire 
you  to  accept  for  the  use  of  yourself  and  little  ones,  and  if  what  I  write  can  have  any 
weight,  I  must  earnestly  entreat  you  to  bring  up  your  children  to  be  good  subjects  to  his 
Majesty.  I  wish  your  husband,  by  surrendering  himself  to  the  Duke  of  Cumberland,  had 
given  me  an  opportunity  of  recommending  him  to  his  Majesty's  mercy.  I  feel  for  you, 
and  am,  Madam,  your  most  obedient  and  humble  servant,  John  Campbell. 

"  To  the  Lady  Ardsheal. 

"Post  free  from  John  Campbell,  Major-General." 

General  Campbell  had  judged  of  the  merciful  disposition  of  the  Duke  of  Cumber- 
land from  his  o^vn  humane  feelings  ;  but  in  December  of  the  same  year  Ardsheal 
House  was  sacked,  and  "the  Lady  Ardsheal,"  compelled  to  flee  for  refuge  to  a  hut. 
From  this  also  she  was  driven,  the  very  night  after  her  confinement,  to  seek,  with  her 
new-bom  infant,  and  five  children,  another  shelter  from  the  falling  snow. 

After  many  trials  and  dangers,  she  succeeded  in  obtaining  passage  to  France,  where 
she  rejoined  her  husband.    They  settled  at  Sens,  in  Champagne,  where  their  life,  though  no 


doubt  troubled  at  times  by  political  hopes  and  fears,  seems  to  have  been  of  a  peaceful 
and  patriarchal  character.  Contributions  in  the  name  of  rent,  in  addition  to  that  paid  to 
the  Crown  receiver,  were  regularly  remitted  to  Ardsheal  by  his  old  tenants,  and  he  was 
thus  enabled  to  dispense  hospitality  and  render  assistance  to  the  West  Highland  gentle- 
men around  him,  who  were  less  favourably  situated.  Letters  still  in  possession  of  the 
family,  from  James  Edgar,  private  secretary  to  James  VIII.,  the  Cardinal  de  Luynes,  the 
Archbishop  of  Sens,  and  others,  attest  the  high  consideration  in  which  Ardsheal  was  held 
by  his  own  Sovereign,  and  by  Louis  XV.,  as  well  as  the  regard  and  esteem  felt  for  him  in 
the  locality  in  which  his  exile  and  the  latter  years  of  his  life  were  spent.  His  own  king 
referred  to  him  the  petitions  of  the  distressed  Highlanders,  or  sought  from  him 
particulars  of  their  respective  claims  and  hopes ;  the  Archbishop  of  Sens  and  other 
neighbouring  magnates  gave  him  the  privilege  of  the  chase  over  their  respective 
domains. 

Further  trials,  however,  were  in  store  for  him.  Campbell  of  Glenure  had  been 
appointed  receiver  of  the  rents  of  the  confiscated  estate,  and,  possibly  on  account  of  the 
tenantry  continuing  to  send  a  second  rent  of  their  lands  to  their  exiled  laird,  he  began  to 
remove  the  old  occupants,  and  to  give  their  farms  to  dependants  of  his  own.  In  conse- 
quence of  this  harsh  and  unjust  conduct,  Glenure  was  shot  on  the  14th  May  1752,  near 
Ballachelish,  it  is  supposed  by  Donald  Breck  Stewart,  who  fled  the  country,  after  having 
at  first  sought  shelter  with  his  relatives  near  Invercomrie  in  Perthshire. 

Campbell's  death  gave  occasion  to  a  somewhat  remarkable  trial.  James  Stewart  of 
Acharn,  the  agent  through  whom  the  rents  were  collected  and  transmitted,  was  arrested, 
and  tried  at  Inveraray  as  being  an  accessory  to  his  death.  At  the  trial  he  was  described 
as  reputed  to  be  a  natural  brother  of  Charles  of  Ardsheal,  but  this  seems  more  than 
doubtful.  The  descent  of  the  Stewarts  of  Acharn  has  been  already  clearly  given,  and 
James  Stewart  was  on  intimate  terms  with  the  sisters  of  Ardsheal  and  their  husbands,  as 
proved  at  the  trial.  He  held  certain  farms  under  Ardsheal,  and  having  espoused  and 
upheld  the  cause  of  the  tenants  threatened  with  eviction,  was  marked  by  the  Campbells 
for  vengeance.  The  Duke  of  Argyll,  as  Lord  Justiciary  of  the  county,  presided  at  the 
trial,  and  eleven  members  of  the  jury  were  Campbells;  two  others  of  the  name,  much  to 
their  honour,  refusing  to  sit  on  a  jury  so  composed  for  the  trial  of  a  Stewart  and  a 
Jacobite.  James  Stewart  was  convicted,  and  condemned  to  be  hanged  where  Glenure 
was  shot.  He  may,  perhaps,  have  been  aware  of  Donald  Breck's  intention,  but  the  com- 
position of  the  jury,  the  social  position  of  the  prisoner,  —for  it  was  shown  that  he  was 
quite  in  the  rank  of  the  gentry  of  the  country, — and  the  harshness  with  which  he  was 
treated  by  the  President  of  the  Court,  created  an  impression  of  injustice,  which  is  not 
even  yet  forgotten  in  Appin  and  Lochaber.  The  London  Evening  Post  of  5  th  December 
1752,  noticed   the   trial  in  the  following  remarkable  words: — "We  are  informed  by  a 


private  letter  that  the  ancient  animosity  between  the  Stewarts  and  the  Campbells  is  likely 
to  revive  on  the  score  of  hanging  James  Stewart  at  Ballachelish,  on  account  of  the  murder 
of  Colin  Campbell  of  Glenure.     The  circumstance  of  trying  James  Stewart  at  Inverary,  the 

seat  of  the  d of  A ,  is  what  his  friends  fix  upon  to  convince  the  world  that  he 

was  harshly  and  unjustly  condemned." 

The  Duke  of  Argyll's  remark  when  passing  sentence  on  James  Stewart,  clearly  shows 
how  far  the  verdict  had  been  influenced  by  political  considerations.  He  said,  "Your 
clan  did  in  the  year  1719  again  rise  in  rebellion,  unmindful  of  their  lives  and  fortunes 
having  been  granted  them  only  two  years  previously,  and  assisted  a  foreign  enemy  in 
invasion."  It  is  needless  to  remark  upon  the  irrelevancy  of  the  participation  of  the  clan 
in  a  political  attempt  made  thirty- three  years  before,  with  the  specific  question  of  Acham's 
guilt  or  innocence  of  the  murder  of  Glenure,  but  the  Duke's  statement,  which,  from  his 
local  knowledge,  is  probably  true,  is  of  some  little  historical  value,  as  it  points  to  the 
Stewarts  having  been  engaged  in  the  rising  of  17 19,  of  which  but  few  particulars  have 
been  preserved. 

In  1 7 18  the  Duke  of  Ormond,  with  the  Scots  Earl  Marischall  and  his  brother,  after- 
wards Marshal  Keith,  had  concerted  with  Cardinal  Alberoni  an  invasion  of  Scotland, 
where  they  expected  to  be  joined  by  all  the  adherents  of  the  exiled  Royal  family.  In 
March  17 19  the  expedition  sailed,  and  early  in  May  a  part  of  it,  after  being  some  time 
at  Stomoway,  landed  on  the  shores  of  Loch  Alsh.  The  whole  forces  originally  consisted 
of  about  6000  troops,  chiefly  Irish,  with  arms  for  10,000  or  12,000  men.  The  main 
portion  of  the  fleet,  commanded  by  the  Duke  of  Ormond,  sailed  from  Cadiz,  but  it  was 
dispersed  by  a  storm  off  Cape  Finisterre,  and  never  joined  the  rest  of  the  expedition, 
which  comprised  two  frigates,  having  on  board  the  Earls  Marischall  and  Seaforth,  the 
Marquis  of  Tullibardine,  307  Spaniards,  and  arms  for  2000  men.  The  Spanish  oflicer  in 
command  was  unwilling  to  land,  finding  that  only  a  few  Highlanders  made  their  appear- 
ance, but  he  was  at  last  prevailed  on  to  do  so  by  the  Scottish  nobles.  They  seized  Eilan 
Donan  Castle,  an  ancient  stronghold  of  the  Earls  of  Ross,  and  subsequently  of  the 
Mackenzies,  which  they  garrisoned  with  50  men,  with  the  intention  of  holding  it  till  they 
were  supported.  The  fire  of  three  Government  vessels,  however,  soon  made  the  fortalice 
untenable,  and  the  Highlanders  withdrew  to  the  more  advantageous  position  of  Strachell, 
where  they  heard  of  the  dispersing  of  the  main  expedition  by  the  storm. 

General  Wightman  had  marched  from  Inverness  with  a  much  superior  force  of  troops, 
and  attacked  the  Highlanders  on  the  i8th  June.  The  latter  held  their  position  for  more 
than  three  hours,  till  the  advance  of  the  artillery  among  the  defiles  of  the  mountains 
warned  them  to  disperse,  but  not  until  they  had  inflicted  upon  the  military  a  loss  of  2 1 
killed  and  upwards  of  120  wounded.  Lord  Seaforth  and  Lord  Tullibardine  were  wounded, 
but  were  carried  off  by  the  Highlanders,  whose  loss  was  never  accurately  ascertained. 


The  Spaniards,  who  had  remained  at  Glenshiel,  without  taking  part  in  the  engagement, 
surrendered  next  day,  and  this  terminated  the  invasion. 

But  to  return  to  the  fortunes  of  Ardsheal.  As  a  result  of  Glenure's  evictions  ensued 
the  failure  of  the  income  which  Charles  had  for  many  years  derived  from  the  "  Laird's 
dues  "  so  long  and  so  honourably  remitted  to  him  by  his  old  tenants,  and  he  became,  for 
a  time,  indebted  to  the  bounty  of  the  Chevalier,  who  sent  him  from  Rome  500  livres, 
promising,  at  the  same  time,  to  recommend  him  to  the  French  King.  Louis  XV.,  in 
consequence,  apportioned  to  him,  out  of  the  40,000  francs  annually  granted  by  the 
French  Treasury  in  aid  of  the  Scotch  refugees,  a  pension  of  3000  francs,  with  many 
comphmentary  expressions ;  and  one  half  of  this  sum  was  continued  to  his  widow,  who 
was  unable  to  obtain  payment  of  her  jointure  upon  the  Ardsheal  estate,  or  of  her  settle- 
ment upon  Lanrick,  though  both  deeds  had  been  executed  before  either  estate  was 
forfeited.  Eventually,  on  14th  January  1767,  Isobel  Haldane  or  Stewart — her  brothers 
having  died  in  1761  and  1764,  and  her  father  in  1765 — was  retoured  heir  portioner  general 
to  her  father,  John  Haldane  of  Lanrick. 

Isobel  Haldane,  to  whom,  at  the  age  of  nineteen,  Ardsheal  was  married  in  1732,  was 
the  youngest  child  of  John  Haldane  of  Lanrick.  Robert  Stewart  of  Appin,  the  chief  of 
the  clan,  had,  since  17 16,  been  under  attainder  and  in  exile,  and  Ardsheal  thus  found 
himself  the  representative  of  the  family  in  the  Highlands.  Married  to  one  who  was  thus 
— not  only  by  hereditary  politics,  but  by  circumstances — deeply  implicated  in  the  enter- 
prise of  attempting  to  restore  "  the  King  over  the  water,"  Isobel  at  once  took  a  high 
position  among  the  Jacobite  families  of  the  Western  Highlands.  She  was  descended 
from  a  Danish  family,  which  had  settled  on  the  borders  of  Scotland,  and  a  younger  son 
of  which  had  acquired,  in  the  twelfth  century,  extensive  possessions  in  Perthshire  by  a 
marriage  with  the  heiress  of  Gleneagles.  About  1650  the  Lanrick  portion  of  the  estate 
was  conferred  upon  a  younger  son,  Patrick,  whose  son  John,  the  father  of  Isobel,  was 
out  both  in  17 15  and  1745,  serving  in  the  latter  campaign  as  first  major  and  commandant 
of  a  squadron  of  cavalry  raised  in  Perthshire.  As  has  been  already  mentioned,  he  was 
excepted  from  the  amnesty,  and  a  Bill  found  against  him  and  his  eldest  son,  who  had  also 
served  as  a  captain  in  his  father's  squadron.  After  Ardsheal's  death,  his  widow  removed 
to  the  neighbourhood  of  Paris,  so  as  to  be  near  her  aged  father,  who  was  also  in  exile. 
She  returned  to  England  in  1779,  for  the  treatment  of  the  dropsy  from  which  she  had 
for  some  time  been  suffering,  and  died  at  Northampton.  The  epitaph  on  her  tomb  in 
the  Church  of  All  Saints,  in  that  town,  gives  much  of  the  story  of  her  eventful  life  : —

The  following  is  a  translation  by  Mr  Ffytche  of  Thoqje  Hall : — 

Isabella  Haldane, 

Daughter  of  John  Haldane  of  Lanrick, 

Widow  of  Charles  Stewart  of  Ardsheal, 

In  an  hostel  finished  an  honourable  career, 

A^Tiose  breast  was  indeed  well  prepared 

By  the  most  arduous  vicissitudes  of  life, 

For  in  a  worse  than  civil  war, 

Her  house  plundered  and  overthrown  by  soldiers. 

Innocent  she  was  compelled  to  give  birth  to  her  babe 

In  a  poor  and  mean  hut, 

And  on  the  next  night  to  flee  through  the  snow 

Accompanied  by  her  young  and  tender  children. 


After  eleven  years  of  love  and  exile, 

Being  left  a  widow  in  straightened  circumstances, 

She  brought  up,  and,  by  unwearied  labour. 

Happily  settled  a  numerous  progeny. 

At  length,  suffering  under  a  severe  dropsy. 

She  endured  with  pious  fortitude  its  reiterated 

Attacks,  most  grievous  to  an  aged  matron, 

For  she  trusted  that  she  should  again  in  Heaven 

See  her  innocent  children  who  had  a  short 

While  gone  before  her. 

In  adversity,  therefore,  O  traveller,  be  not 

Too  much  dismayed, 

Piety  may  surmount  a  rugged  road. 

She  died  8th  of  April  1782, 

In  the  69th  year  of  her  age.

clan,  and  heir  male  and  representative  of  the  Stewarts  of  Ardsheal, 
Appin,  and  Lorn,  was  born  in  1805,  and  succeeded  his  father  in  1844, 
and  is  unmarried.  On  his  death,  the  representation  of  the  clan  and 
family  will  devolve  upon  the  eldest  male  heir  of  the  late  Duncan

STRATHGARRY. 

JOHN  STEWART,  second  son  of  Alan  Stewart,  third  of  Appin,  received  from  his 
father  the  lands  of  Strathgarry  in  Athole,  after  the  return  of  Alan  and  his  five  sons 
from  Flodden,  a.d.  1513. 

This  family  of  Strathgarry  appears  to  have  left  Scotland  before  1730,  when  the  lands 
were  sold  to  a  cadet  of  the  family  of  Invernahyle,  by  a  lineal  descendant  of  whom  they 
are  still  held,  together  with  the  lands  of  Innerhadden,  also  in  Athole.      Vide  Invernahyle. 

About  one  hundred  and  fifty  years  ago,  Dugald  Stewart,  the  representative  of  John, 
second  son  of  Alan,  was  a  Lieutenant  in  Halkett's  regiment  in  the  Dutch  army,  and 
seems  subsequently  to  have  risen  to  the  rank  of  Lieutenant-Colonel.  He  married  Susan 
Fairfoul,  daughter  of  Lieutenant  Fairfoul  of  Braeindam,  and  left  issue.  There  are  many 
gentlemen  of  the  name  of  Stewart  holding  good  positions  in  the  civil  and  military  services 
of  Holland,  but  all  endeavours  to  trace  the  descendants  of  Dugald  Stewart  among  them 
have  been  unsuccessful,  though  it  is  possible  that  they  still  exist  in  that  country. 

The  Stewarts  of  Glen  Ogle,  and  others  in  Balquidder,  are  also  descendants  of  the 
Stewarts  of  Appin,  but  the  old  families  of  Baldorran,  Ardvorlich,  Annat,  Gartnafuaroe, 
and  the  original  Stewarts  of  Glenbuckie,  were  all  descended  from  Lord  James  Stewart, 
son  of  Murdoch,  Duke  of  Albany. 

Sometime  towards  the  end  of  the  sixteenth  century,  Stewart  of  Strathgarry,  having 
taken  possession  of  lands  in  the  upper  part  of  Rannoch,  which  had  been  possessed  by  a 
Macdonald,  was  surprised  by  a  party  of  that  clan,  and  killed  by  them  for  dispossessing 
their  kinsman.  A  meeting  of  the  Stewarts  of  Appin,  Balquidder,  and  Athole  was  held  at 
the  Bridge  of  Keltney,  where  they  entered  into  a  written  bond  to  avenge  the  death  of 
their  kinsman  of  Strathgarry,  and  it  was  arranged  that  they  should  all  meet  on  the  Black- 
mount  on  a  day  agreed  upon.  At  the  appointed  time  the  Appin  Stewarts  came  up 
through  Glencoe,  the  Athole  Stewarts  marched  up  the  braes  of  Rannoch,  and  the  Stewarts 
of  Balquidder,  headed  by  Ardvorlich,  came  by  Tyndrum. 


They  had  letters  of  Fire  and  Sword  against  the  murderers  of  Strathgarry,  which  his 
widow  had  procured  by  going  to  Stirling,  and  showing  her  husband's  bloody  shirt  to  the 
Privy  Council.  As  it  was  in  the  month  of  June,  the  Macdonalds  of  Glencoe  were  out  at 
their  shealings  in  the  Blackmount,  where  they  were  surrounded  by  the  Stewarts,  and  a 
number  of  them  killed.  The  laird  of  Glencoe  and  his  brother  were  among  the  slain,  and 
their  heads  were  cut  ofiF,  to  be  sent  to  Stirling  and  presented  to  the  Privy  Council,  as  an 
unquestionable  proof  that  their  orders  had  been  fully  carried  out.  A  messenger  was 
despatched  with  them  in  a  small  barrel,  which  he  carried  on  his  shoulder.  He  occa- 
sionally shook  the  barrel,  and  made  the  heads  knock  against  each  other,  exclaiming  in 
Gaelic,  "  Can't  you  agree ;  I  am  sure  you  are  friends." 

He  halted  at  Ardvorlich  on  his  way  south,  and  no  one  being  at  home  but  the  Lady 
of  Ardvorlich,  he  asked  to  see  her,  and  said  he  had  brought  two  strangers  to  visit  her, 
Glencoe  and  his  brother.  The  lady  was  much  alarmed,  as  all  the  men  were  away  at  the 
rendezvous,  but  the  messenger  soon  allayed  her  fears  by  producing  the  two  heads. 

A  copy  of  the  bond  entered  into  by  the  Appin  and  Perthshire  Stewarts  to  avenge  the 
death  of  Strathgarry  was  long  in  the  possession  of  the  Ardvorlich  family,  but  it  was  lent 
to  a  Stewart  of  Annat,  and  at  his  death  could  not  be  found  amongst  his  papers.  A  copy 
of  it  is  said  to  be  in  the  possession  of  the  Duke  of  Athole. 


ACHNACONE. 

ACHNACONE,  in  the  charter  of  a.d.  1500  spelled  Auchnaguone,  signifies  the  "  field 
of  dogs,"  and  obtained  its  name  when  Castle  Stalcaire  was  occupied  as  a  hunting 
seat  by  the  ancient  Lords  of  Lorn,  and  afterwards  by  James  IV.  and  James  V.  of  Scotland, 
from  its  being  the  place  where  the  hounds  were  usually  slipped  or  thrown  off  on  a  hunting 
morning.  The  rising  ground,  now  occupied  by  the  present  mansion,  commands  an 
unobstructed  view  of  the  Strath  of  Appin,  and  down  Loch  Creran  to  Loch  Linnhe,  and 
was  a  favourable  situation  for  hunting  the  deer  driven  down  from  the  mountains  to  the 
Strath. 

DuGALD,  first  of  Achnacone,  was  third  son  of  Alan,  third  of  Appin,  by  his  wife,  a 
daughter  of  Lochiel.  The  old  and  valuable  papers  of  the  Achnacone  family  have 
unfortunately  been  lost,  and  this  loss  is  the  more  to  be  regretted  as  they  were  of  such 
importance  as  to  be  referred  to  as  authentic  sources  of  information  by  Mr  Brown,  when 
he  was  compiling  his  Genealogical  Tree  of  the  Stewarts  in  1792. 

Unhappily,  scarcely  anything  now  remains  of  this  collection,  excepting  some  marriage 
setdements  with  the  Glencoe  family. 

U 


These  lands,  however,  as  narrated  by  Duncan  Stewart  in  his  "History  of  the  Stewarts," 
descended  from  Dugald,  who  received  them  from  his  father  soon  after  the  battle  of  Flodden 
in  1513,  in  regular  hereditary  succession  to  Duncan  Stewart,  who  married  Mary,  daughter 
of  Duncan  Stewart  of  Inverlochy,  of  the  family  of  Fasnacloich,  and  died  in  1850,  leaving 
issue — 

1.  Mary  Isabella,  married  to  Lieutenant-Colonel  Alexander  Macdonald,  son  of 

Lieutenant-Colonel  Archibald  Macdonald,  of  the  Keppoch  family,  by  whom  she 
had  two  daughters,  Margaret  and  Mary. 

2.  Jessie,  died  unmarried. 

3.  Alexander,  now  of  Achnacone,  of  whom  hereafter. 

4.  John,  died  unmarried.

died,  leaving  three  sons  and  one  daughter. 

6.  Donald,  died  unmarried. 

7.  Christina,   married   to   Thomas   Beattie  of  Creive,  and  had  t^vo  daughters — 

Christina,  who  died  young,  and  Mary  Stewart  Beattie,  now  of  Creive  and 
Glenmorven. 

8.  Charles  Edward,  who  entered  the  Royal  Navy  in  1827,  and  served  at  the  Cape 

and  in  South  America.  He  afterwards  entered  the  diplomatic  service  as 
Financial  Secretary  and  Treasurer  under  Sir  Henry  Pottinger  during  the  second 
Chinese  War,  taking  an  active  part  in  the  negotiations  for  the  treaty  of  peace  by 
which  it  was  terminated.  He  was  for  many  years  Secretary  to  the  London  and 
North-Western  Railway  Company,  and  subsequently  Chairman  of  the  Anglo- 
American  Telegraph  Company.  Charies  Edward  Stewart  died  unmarried  in 
1868,  and  the  following  is  an  extract  from  a  minute  of  the  New  York  Board  of 
Directors  of  the  Telegraph  Company,  recognising  the  valuable  services  he  had 
rendered  in  establishing  telegraphic  communication  between  England  and 
America  : — 

"  New  York,  13//^  April  1868. 
"  The  Board  having  heard  with  profound  regret  of  the  sudden  death  of  Mr 
Charles  Stewart,  late  Chairman  of  the  Anglo-American  Telegraph  Company, 
desire  to  record  their  deep  sense  of  the  loss  which  has  thus  unexpectedly  been 
sustained,  not  only  by  the  company  of  which  he  was  the  able,  dignified,  and 
faithful  chief  executive  officer,  but  by  the  whole  telegraphic  interest  of  the  world, 
which  owed  so  much  to  his  enlightened  public  spirit  and  the  large  catholic  views 
which  governed  Mr  Stewart,  not  only  in  the  discharge  of  his  duties,  but  in  the 
extension  of  this  beneficent  agent  of  civilisation  into  the  remotest  quarters  of 
the  globe." 


Alexander  Stewart,  now  of  Achnacone,  went  to  India  in  1831,  and  entered  the 
Government  Civil  Service,  from  which  he  retired  in  1861.  He  married  Mary  Montague, 
eldest  daughter  of  Daniel  Wilson  Davison  of  Brand  Hall,  Shropshire,  and  has  issue — 

1.  Charles  Montague  Duncan. 

2.  Mary,  married  to  John  Stuart  of  Kishom,  second  son  of  the  Right  Hon.  Sir  John 

Stuart      Vide  Ballachelish. 

3.  Alexander  Kenneth,  Physician  in  Her  Majesty's  Forces  in  India.

received  the  lands  of  Fasnacloich  from  his  father  after  their  return  from  Flodden  in 
15 13.  Fasnacloich  is  situated  at  the  foot  of  Glen  Creran,  and  the  name  signifies  a 
field  or  place  of  stones  or  crags.  James,  first  of  Fasnacloich,  married  a  daughter  of

Captain  John  Campbell  Stewart  served  in  the  72nd  Regiment,  "  The  Duke  of  Albany's 
Own  Highlanders,"  during  the  Crimean  campaign  in  1855  and  1856,  was  present  at  the 
capture  of  Kertch,  and  at  the  siege  and  fall  of  Sebastopol,  for  which  he  has  medal  and 
clasp,  Turkish  medal,  and  fifth  class  of  the  Order  of  Medjidi.  He  also  served  in  the 
Indian  Mutiny  of  1857,  and  in  the  pursuit  of  the  rebels  in  1858,  and  was  at  the  capture 
of  the  fortress  of  Kotah,  and  the  action  on  the  Bumass  River,  for  which  he  has  a  medal 
and  clasp.  After  returning  to  his  estate  from  a  distinguished  career  in  the  army,  Captain 
Stewart  has  earned,  by  his  liberality  and  his  exertions  in  their  behalf,  the  lasting  gratitude 
of  the  Episcopal  community  of  Glencreran.  Ever  since  the  disestablishment  of  the 
Episcopal  Church  of  Scotland  in  1688,  a  large  portion  of  the  people  of  Appin  has 
remained  faithful  to  her  creed,  and  from  that  time  till  now  the  services  of  the  Church 
have  been  kept  up  continuously  at  Glencreran,  though  at  various  places,  and  at  one  time 
in  a  chapel,  now  quite  ruinous.  But  by  the  erection  of  St  Mary's  Church  on  his  estate 
in  1877-8,  with  its  parsonage  adjoining,  for  which  Captain  Stewart  gave  the  site,  and  to 
which  he  liberally  contributed,  he  has  provided  for  the  regular  and  permanent  services  of 
the  Church  to  which  the  people  of  Appin  of  the  old  stocks  have  been  so  steadfastly  faithful. 
In  Bishop  Ewing's  eloquent  charge  to  the  clergy  of  Argyll  and  the  Isles  in  1864,  he  writes  : 
— "  On  those  sweet  lochs  and  dreamy  shores,  which  are  characteristic  of  this  diocese, 
there  is  indeed  more  than  lona.  In  the  district  of  Appin,  on  the  shores  of  Glencreran, 
on  the  banks  of  Loch  Leven,  in  the  valley  of  Glencoe,  on  the  borders  of  Loch  Linnhe, 
there  are  still  some  representatives  of  the  past,  some  blood  of  the  ancient  race,  some 
worship  not  unlike  the  worship  of  lona." 

Alexander  James,  third  son  of  John  Stewart,  sixth  of  Fasnacloich,  and  of  his  wife 
Moir,  daughter  of  Duncan  Stewart,  second  of  Ardsheal,  was  born  in  1672.  As  a  youth  of 
seventeen,  he  was  present  at  the  batde  of  Killiecrankie  in  1689,  and  at  the  siege  of 
Dunkeld  following.  He  was  also  at  the  batde  of  Sheriffmuir  in  17 15,  and  after  that 
engagement  went  abroad.     Being  se\enty-three  years  of  age,  he  was  too  old  to  join  Prince 


Charles  Edward's  army  in  1745,  but  took  an  active  part  in  raising  men  for  the  expedition, 
and  in  1746  he  was  examined  at  the  trial  of  Murray  of  Broughton,  with  a  view  of  eliciting 
from  him  a  corroboration  of  that  traitor's  evidence  against  gentlemen  engaged  in  the 
rising,  but  he  feigned  dotage.  Alexander  Stewart  married  Anne  Stewart  of  the  family  of 
Ardsheal,  and  died  at  the  age  of  ninety-six,  in  May  1768,  leaving  one  son,  Charles. 

Charles  Stewart,  only  son  of  Alexander,  was  attached  to  the  person  of  Prince  Charles 
in  1745-6  as  his  Purse  Bearer,  and  received  from  the  Prince  the  appointment  of  Sheriff  of 
Argyll.  He  was  present  at  the  battles  of  Prestonpans,  Falkirk,  and  Culloden,  and  was 
one  of  those  who,  after  that  ill-starred  day,  found  a  place  of  refuge  and  concealment  in 
Appin,  though  that  district  was  then  in  possession  of  the  Duke  of  Cumberland's  troops. 
But  he  soon  quitted  this  comparative  security  to  endeavour  to  rejoin  and  assist  Prince 
Charles  Edward,  and  sometime  afterwards  escaped  to  France,  where  he  is  named  as  one 
of  those  who,  at  the  instance  of  James  VIII.,  received  grants  for  their  support  from  Louis 
XV.  He  married  Elizabeth,  daughter  of  Johnstone  of  Redacres,  a  cadet  of  the  family  of 
Johnstone  of  Corehead,  and  a  descendant  of  Rachel,  daughter  of  Walter  Whitefoord  of 
Whitefoord,  Bishop  of  Brechin.  Nisbet  says  "  the  first  of  the  family  was  Walter  de 
Whitefoord  in  Renfrewshire,  who  got  Whitefoord  for  his  services  at  the  battle  of  Largs, 
when  under  the  command  of  Alexander,  Senescallus  Scotiae."  The  estate  of  Whitefoord 
descended  in  regular  succession  to  Adam  Whitefoord  of  that  Ilk,  who  by  his  wife,  the 
daughter  of  Sir  James  Somervell  of  Camnethan,  had  two  sons,  James,  his  successor,  and 
Dr  Walter  'Whitefoord,  first  sub-dean  of  Glasgow,  aftenvards  parson  of  Moffat,  and  in 
1635  advanced  to  the  Episcopal  See  of  Brechin.     Charles  Stewart  left  issue — 

1.  Alexander,  who  died  young. 

2.  Duncan,  who  succeeded. 

3.  William,  of  whom  hereafter. 

4.  John,  who  died  in  India,  unmarried. 

5.  Elizabeth,  married  to  Donald  Cameron. 

6.  Christina,  married  to Stewart,  and  had  issue,  no\y  extinct 

Duncan  Stewart,  second  son  of  Charles  Stewart,  was  Commandant  of  Fort  William, 
and  married  Jessie,  daughter  of  Donald  M'Phee,  Loch  Arkaig,  and  had  issue — 

1.  Alexander,  Lieutenant-Colonel  in  the  95th  Regiment,  Rifle  Brigade,  married 

Harriet  Palmer,  and  had  issue,  Charles  Alexander  and  Agnes,  both  of  whom 
died  unmarried. 

2.  John,  Major  in  the  95th  Regiment,  Rifle  Brigade.     He  was  an  officer  of  great 

distinction,  and  served  on  the  continent  with  the  79th  regiment  in  1794;  in 
1795-96  and '97  in  the  West  Indies;  in  1798  in  Germany;  in  1799  in  the 
campaign  in  Holland ;  in  1800  at  Ferrol  with  a  detachment  of  the  Rifle  Brigade ; 
and  in  1801  with  Sir  Ralph  Abercromby  in  Egypt,  where  he  was  wounded.     In 


i8o2-s  Major  Stewart  was  with  his  regiment  at  home,  and  in  1S06-7  he  was 
in  South  America,  serving  on  General  Whitelock's  staff  at  the  taking  of 
Monte  Video,  and  during  the  following  campaign.  In  1808  he  was  on  the 
staff  of  Sir  John  Moore  during  the  campaign  in  Spain,  and  in  1S09  10,  and 
till  his  death  in  181 1,  he  served  with  his  regiment  during  the  campaigns  in 
Spain  and  Portugal,  under  Lord  Wellington.  He  fell  on  the  14th  of  March  in 
that  year,  in  the  course  of  the  operations  on  the  Mondego,  when,  in  command 
of  the  left  wing  of  his  regiment,  he  was  leading  a  charge  with  the  bayonet. 
General  Sir  Benjamin  D'Urban  wrote,  that  when  "  he  was  wounded,  as  in  every 
action  of  his  military  life,  he  was  a  bright  example  of  calm  intrepidity,  and  many 
were  admiring  his  gallantry  and  skill."  Sir  Sidney  Beckwith  also  wrote  of  him 
in  terms  of  the  highest  praise,  and  the  London  Courier  of  the  24th  April  181 1 
gave  a  detailed  notice  of  Major  Stewart's  career,  observing  that  "scarcely  a 
service  of  activity  and  danger  had  occurred  within  the  previous  eighteen  years 
in  which  he  had  not  been  employed,  and  that  on  all  occasions  not  only  had  he 
distinguished  himself  by  his  skill  and  bravery,  by  his  steady  and  soldier-like  con- 
duct in  the  field,  but  that  he  had  made  himself  master  of  his  profession,  so  far 
as  study  and  a  good  understanding  could  enable  him."  The  Courier  concluded 
by  saying  that  "  he  fell  like  another  Wolfe,  in  the  arms  of  victory,  not  too  soon 
for  his  own  glory,  for  he  was  known  and  admired  by  the  whole  army,  but  much 
too  soon  for  his  country,  which  had  a  right  to  expect  that  in  due  course  he 
would  supply  the  place  of  some  one  of  the  great  generals  of  the  present  day, 
distinguishing  himself,  like  them,  by  another  Maida,  Talavera,  or  Barrossa." 

The  letter  written  on  the  occasion  of  the  death  of  Major  Stewart,  to  his  elder 
brother,  is  given  at  length.  The  writer  was  the  distinguished  Colonel  Cameron 
of  Fassifem,  who  so  long  and  so  gloriously  commanded  the  92nd  Highlanders, 
and  who  himself,  four  years  later,  met  a  like  soldier's  death  on  the  field  of 
Quatre  Bras.  It  is  characteristic  of  both  the  gallant  soldiers  who — maintaining 
under  southern  skies  and  the  British  flag  that  close  friendship  which  had  for 
centuries  associated  their  families  in  the  cause  of  loyalty  and  the  Stuarts — had 
together,  and  almost  shoulder  to  shoulder  in  old  Highland  fashion,  borne  up 
the  fray  against  the  enemies  of  their  country  on  many  a  bloody  and  well-fought 
field.  It  is  a  sermon  by  two  true  soldiers,  inculcating — with  few  words  of 
preaching,  but  by  that  example  which  is  better  than  precept  —resignation,  cheer- 
fulness, hope,  courage,  and  devotion. 

"  Hutted  on  the  Mondego, 

NEAR  the  PonTE  DE  MaRIELLO. 

"  My  dear  Friend, — The  fate  of  man  is  mortality.     Prepare  yourself  for 


the  greatest  affliction,  in  having  that  truth  brought  home  to  your  feelings  with  a 
vengeance.  But,  at  the  same  time,  draw  some  consolation  from  the  reflection 
that  he  fell  on  the  bed  of  honour,  and  died  a  martyr  to  that  glory  which  he  so 
successfully  pursued,  lamented  and  regretted  by  all,  one  of  the  brightest  orna- 
ments of  his  country  and  profession. 

"  Poor  John,  I  was  not  far  from  him  when  he  fell  Word  was  brought 
me  that  he  inquired  for  me.  I  went  and  saw  him.  He  beckoned  to  me  to 
sit  down  by  him,  but  the  doctors  would  not  allow  me  to  sit,  or  speak  to  him. 
But  in  spite  of  the  doctors  he  made  me  bend  over  him,  and  said  in  Gaelic,  '  My 
dear  fellow,  let  them  know  that  I  am  quite  well,  and  want  for  nothing.  The 
doctors  are  kind  to  me,  and  in  a  month  I  shall  be  at  them  again.'  The  French 
were  then  hard  at  the  head  of  our  column  with  small  and  great  guns.  I  was 
obliged  to  go  on.  I  never  saw  a  man  in  better  spirits.  He  pressed  my  hand 
eagerly,  and  we  parted  never  to  meet  again.  At  eleven  that  night  his  soul  fled 
to  heaven.  His  wound  was  through  the  body  and  out  at  the  back.  God  bless 
and  strengthen  you. — Yours  ever,  J.  Cameron."

Hyle,  a  stream  separating  the  property  from  Achnacone. 

In  the  following  account  of  Alexander  and  his  descendants,  the  quaint  style  of  the 
old  family  MS.,  from  which  it  has  been  abridged,  has  been  as  far  as  possible  preserved.  It 
would  appear  that  Alexander  lived  at  Eilean-'n-Stalcair  (Falconer's  Island),  and  early  one 
summer  morning  went  to  an  island  called  Eilean  nan  Gall,  which  lies  contiguous,  and  can 
be  approached  on  foot  at  low  water.  Not  apprehending  any  danger,  he  laid  down  his 
Lochaber  axe  carelessly  by  his  side.  A  deadly  feud  then  existed  betwixt  his  family  and 
that  of  the  Campbells  of  Dunstaffnage,  and  at  this  very  time  Cailean  Uaine  (Green  Colin), 
brother  to  Dunstaffnage,  having  landed  with  a  party  of  men,  came  up  suddenly  and  seized 
hold  of  the  axe,  exclaiming,  "  This  is  a  good  axe,  if  it  had  a  good  handle  to  it ! "  Alex- 
ander immediately  replied,  "  Has  it  not  that  ?  "  showing  at  the  same  time  his  appreciation 
of  Colin's  sarcastic  meaning  by  the  practical  repartee  of  laying  his  own  hand  upon  it. 


During  the  struggle  which  followed,  Alexander  was  surrounded  by  Colin's  men  and  basely 
murdered.  His  infant  son  only  escaped  a  like  fate  through  the  courage  and  devotion  of 
his  nurse,  Morag,  wife  of  Raibeart-a-Pheti,  smith  or  armourer  of  Moidart,  who,  to  ensure 
the  safety  of  her  charge,  fled  with  him  to  her  own  country,  after  having  concealed  him 
for  three  days  in  a  cave,  now  known  as  Uaimh  Dhomnuil  nan  Ord. 

Alexander  had  married  Margaret,  daughter  of  Macdonald  of  Lochan,  brother  to 
Muidart,  by  whom  he  had  one  son,  Donald,  who  succeeded  him.  The  Moidart  family 
claim  descent  from  Ranald  or  Reginald  de  Yle,  who  got  a  grant  of  lands  from  his  father, 
with  confirmation  under  the  Great  Seal  of  Robert  II.  in  1372-3.  Ranald  was  second  son 
of  John  de  Yle,  whose  second  wife  was  Margaret  Stewart,  daughter  of  Robert  II. 

Donald,  second  of  Invemahyle,  so  well  known  as  Domhnull-nan-ord,  or  Donald  of 
the  hammers,  was  reared  by  the  armourer  and  his  wife,  as  if  he  had  been  one  of  their 
own  sons.  They,  indeed,  loved  their  foster-son,  or  dalt  as  he  was  called  in  the  Gaelic, 
with  the  strongest  and  truest  affection.  Raibeart's  armour-work  bore  the  highest  reputa- 
tion, so  much  so  that  it  was  a  common  question  in  the  district,  "  Is  that  a  Moidart-made 
sword  you  wear  ?  "  Both  as  armourer  and  as  tacksman  of  farms  on  Lochsheilside,  he  held 
a  much  higher  social  position  than  that  held  by  a  smith  in  the  present  day.  Donald,  as 
he  grew  up,  developed  remarkable  talents,  both  mental  and  physical.  He  was  ready  of 
wit,  quick  in  expedient,  and  of  uncommon  resolution,  combined  with  great  strength  and 
activity.  He  could  take  in  each  hand  one  of  the  large  hammers  which  required  the  full 
strength  of  an  ordinary  workman,  and  wield  both  at  the  same  time  without  any  unusual 
effort.  He  could  dive,  it  is  said,  into  a  pool  of  the  river  Shiel,  near  the  smith's  house, 
and  bring  up  a  salmon  with  his  hands.  On  Donald's  reaching  manhood,  Raibeart  told 
him  the  secret  of  his  birth,  at  the  same  time  presenting  him  with  a  sword  tempered  with 
the  utmost  cunning  of  his  art,  and  offering  him  the  assistance  of  his  foster-brothers  in 
taking  vengeance  on  his  father's  murderers.  His  uncle,  Muidart,  on  being  made  aware 
of  the  truth,  recognised  the  relationship,  and  placed  at  his  disposal  a  number  of  men 
chosen  from  his  clan.  Invemahyle,  in  the  absence  of  an  heir,  had  reverted  to  Appin, 
but  the  chief,  fully  convinced  of  Donald's  birthright  to  the  land,  at  once  restored  it. 
Donald,  without  delay,  attacked  Dunstaffnage,  but  though  success  ultimately  crowned  his 
efforts,  it  was  not  until  after  several  fights  in  which  Cailean  Uaine  and  nine  other  gentle- 
men of  that  family  were  slain.  Colin  was  killed  by  one  of  Donald's  men,  who  pierced 
him  with  an  arrow  as  he  was  attempting  to  escape  by  swimming  over  the  river  Lyon 
(Leven).  While  the  arrow  was  still  quivering  in  Colin's  breast,  one  of  the  Campbells 
called  out  from  the  opposite  side  of  the  river,  "  That  is  clean  blood  you  have  given  the 
Lyon  salmon  to-day  !"  "Not  so  clean,"  was  the  retort,  "as  you  gave,  without  cause,  one 
fine  morning  to  the  crabs  of  Eilean-'n-Stalcair  !  " 

Argyll,  greatly  annoyed  at  the  manner  in  which  Invemahyle  was  harassing  his  clan. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  167 

tried  several  times  to  cut  him  off.  This  caused  Donald  to  make  a  foray  on  Loch- 
awe- side,  commemorated  in  the  following  verse  of  a  Gaelic  ballad  still  recited  in 
Appin  : — 

"  Donald-nan-ord,  the  armourer's  dalt, 
In  full  coat  of  mail  becomingly  clad, 
Lifted  the  creach  from  the  banks  of  Lochowe, 
Which  retrieve  Mac-a-Chailein  shall  never,  nor  now, 
Nor  son,  nor  great-grandson,  nor  grandson  know  how." 

The  fulness  of  the  coat  of  mail  marked  the  strength  of  the  wearer. 

Appin,  and  other  friends  of  Invemahyle,  wishing  to  bring  the  feud  to  an  end,  insisted 
on  his  making  peace  with  Argyll,  and  Donald  went  to  Inveraray  for  that  purpose.  The 
meeting  with  Argyll  took  place  at  some  distance  from  the  castle,  and  the  interview  is 
thus  narrated  by  the  bard.  Donald,  who  apparently  did  not  anticipate  that  the  confer 
ence  would  result  in  any  increase  of  their  mutual  affection,  thus  accosts  the  Earl : — 

"  Mhic-a-Chailean,  grim  and  sallow. 
Small 's  the  love  you  bear  to  me ; 
But  when  my  homeward  path  I  follow, 
'Tis  well  if  I  bear  more  towards  thee." 

When  laughing  heartily,  Donald  had  an  ungraceful  habit  of  throwing  back  his  head, 
a  habit  perpetuated — says  the  family  MS.,  with  some  humour— in  some  of  his  descendants 
to  the  present  generation.  Argyll  is  related  by  the  poet  to  have  made  a  sneering  re- 
ference to  this,  and  to  have  asked,  pointing  to  the  rock  above  Ardkinlas,  if  Invemahyle 
knew  that  it  was  called  "the  ugly  laugh."  The  rejoinder,  though,  perhaps,  not  more 
courteous  than  the  remark  which  called  it  forth,  was,  at  least,  equally  cutting : — 

"  Ugly  the  laugh  on  the  cliff  of  yon  hill. 
Which  for  aye  has  been  stamped  on  the  place  ; 
But  as  grim,  and  as  ugly,  you'll  find  when  you  will. 
By  a  look  at  your  Countess'  face." 

Argyll  would  only  consent  to  make  peace  on  the  crafty  condition  that  Invemahyle 
should  raise  "  herships  "  on  Moidart  and  Athole,  hoping  thus  to  bring  him  into  collision 
with  these  his  most  intimate  friends.  But  Argyll  had  met  an  intellect  quite  equal  to  his 
own.  Donald  agreed  to  the  terms,  but  subsequently  made  an  arrangement  with  his 
uncle  and  Athole  by  which  they  permitted  him  to  raise  a  spoil  from  some  refractory 
tenants  who  had  sorely  provoked  them,  while  any  pursuit,  which,  to  save  appearances, 
they  would  have  to  make,  would  be  more  in  show  than  in  reality.  Thus,  to  the  great 
chagrin  of  Argyll,  Donald  fulfilled  his  part  of  the  compact  without  losing  the  regard  of 
his  old  friends. 


His  chief,  Alan  Stewart,  third  of  Appin,  being  a  very  old  man,  and  his  eldest  son, 
Duncan,  dead,  we  find  the  clan  commanded  at  the  battle  of  Pinkie,  on  loth  September 
1547,  by  Invemahyle,  as  Tutor.  In  the  absence  of  the  exact  dates  of  the  deaths  of  Alan's 
sons,  there  is  no  certainty  upon  the  point,  but  the  strong  probability  appears  to  be  that 
Invemahyle  held  this  command  under  exceptional  conditions,  that  is  to  say,  by  the  express 
appointment  of  the  Chief,  in  consideration  of  his  remarkable  military  abilities,  and  not  by 
the  claims  of  birthright.  On  their  march  homeward  in  the  following  month,  when  pass- 
ing through  Menteith,  the  clan  found  prepared,  at  the  house  of  one  of  the  tenants,  a 
marriage  dinner,  at  which  the  Earl  of  Menteith  was  to  be  present.  Being  very  hungry, 
Donald  and  his  followers  quickly  disposed  of  the  feast,  without  much  consideration  of 
consequences.  Menteith,  arriving  immediately  afterwards,  was  very  wroth  at  the  insult 
which  he  conceived  had  been  offered  to  him,  and  instantly  pursued  the  Stewarts.  On 
overtaking  them,  one  of  the  Grahams  taunted  them  thus  : — 

"  Yellow-haired  Stewarts,  of  smartest  deeds, 
Who  could  grab  at  the  kale  in  your  sorest  needs  ! " 

To  which  a  Stewart  replied, — 

"  If  smartness  in  deeds  is  ours  by  descent, 
Then  I  draw— and  to  pierce  you  this  arrow  is  sent," 

at  the  same  time  suiting  the  action  to  the  word. 

A  conflict  followed,  in  which  the  Earl  and  many  of  his  men  were  killed.  The  Appin 
men  marched  off  in  triumph,  the  pipers  playing  the  Stewarts'  march,  "  We  will  up  and 
march  away,  we  will  up  and  march  away,  we  will  up  and  march  away,  daring  let  of  all 
men."     The  whole  words  and  music  of  this  spirit-stirring  march  are  given  at  pages 

In  Eraser's  book  of  "  The  Lennox,"  it  is  said,  "  William,  fifth  Earl  of  Menteith,  was 
killed  at  Tobanareal,  a  spring  on  the  summit  of  the  ridge  which  divides  Menteith  from 
Strathgartney,  by  the  celebrated  Donald  Stewart  of  Invemahyle,  Tutor  of  Appin,  famili- 
arly called  '  na'n  Ord,'  or  of  the  Hammers."  Duncan  Stewart's  account  is  that  Donald, 
"in  his  return,  was  attacked  by  the  Earl  of  Menteith,  at  a  place  called  Tipard'nerheil, 
near  the  Port  of  Menteith,  in  resentment  of  a  little  malverse  some  of  Stewart's  men  had 
been  guilty  of  in  their  march,  where  the  Earl  and  some  few  of  his  friends  and  followers 
were  killed." 

Donald  looked  with  intense  contempt  on  every  employment  for  a  gentlemen  other 
than  that  of  war  or  the  chase.  The  quiet,  domestic  life  of  his  son  Duncan,  and  his  great 
interest  in  his  farm-work,  troubled  him  sorely.  He  bore  it,  however,  with  outward  patience 
until  one  day,  when  he  saw  his  son  not  only  directing  his  labourers,  but  even,  for  the  pur- 
pose of  showing  more  clearly  what  he  wished  to  be  done,  taking  a  spade  into  his  own 
hands.  His  long-simmering  wrath  at  once  boiled  over,  and  the  fiery  old  chieftain,  draw- 
ing his  dirk,  pursued  his  son  into  the  house,  where,  supposmg  or  pretending  to  suppose 


that  Duncan  had  hidden  in  the  bed,  he  struck  with  such  force  as  to  drive  the  weapon 
through  both  bed  and  bedding.  Happily  his  son,  as  the  old  gentleman  was  probably 
well  aware,  had  hidden  elsewhere.  The  reef  of  rocks  where  he  crossed  the  river  Hyle  in 
pursuit  of  his  son  is  still  called  Donald's  steps.  The  history  of  Donald  n'an  Ord 
has  been  immortalised  by  Sir  Walter  Scott,  in  a  history  of  his  life,  printed  in  the  fifth 
edition  of  Captain  Burt's  letters,  by  Robert  Jamieson,  F.S.A.  of  London  and  Scotland. 

Brought  up  in  circumstances  not  entirely  dissimilar  from  those  attending  the  early 
life  of  his  great-grandfather,  Dugald,  first  of  Appin,  Donald  seems  to  have  shared  his 
ancestor's  ignorance  of,  or  contempt  for,  forms  of  law.  It  was  not  till  about  1570,  when 
he  was  himself  advanced  in  years,  and  when  he  was  making  over  the  lands  of  Innerphuill 
to  his  son  Duncan,  some  time  after  the  marriage  of  the  latter,  that  he  bethought  himself 
of  taking  formal  sasine  of  the  estate  which  he  had  regained. 

The  "Precept  of  Seisin  of  the  lands  of  Innemaheil  and  Innerpollan  in  favours  of  Donald 
Stewart,  son  of  Alexander,  son  of  Alan,  ad  annum  1570,"  is  noticed  by  Duncan  Stewart. 

He  died  at  a  very  advanced  age  towards  the  close  of  the  sixteenth  century,  and  was 
buried  at  Lismore.  By  his  first  wife,  a  daughter  of  John  Stewart  of  Bunrannoch  (Drum- 
chuin),  he  had — 

1.  Alexander,  who  died  young. 

2.  Duncan,  his  successor 

3.  Alan,  of  whom  Ballachelish. 

4.  John,  who  got  Lettershuna,  the  old  name  of  the  lands  round  Appin  House.     He 

married  a  daughter  of  James  Stewart  of  The  Glens,  and  had  issue  six  daughters. 
Among  the  retours  of  1633,  Mary,  the  wife  of  Dugald  M'Dougall  of  Dounhach 
(Dunach),  and  second  daughter  of  John  Stewart  of  Lettirschewnay,  and  her 
sisters,  Catharine  the  eldest,  Margaret  the  third,  Isobel  the  fourth,  Janet  the 
fifth,  and  Agnes  the  sixth,  were  served  heirs-portioners  to  their  father  in  the 
lands  of  Achachosgrane,  of  the  old  extent  of  two  merks  in  the  barony  of  Appin. 

5.  A  daughter,  married  to  Archibald  Campbell  of  Achalader. 
Invemahyle  married,  secondly,  the  widow  of  James  Stewart  of  The  Glens. 
Duncan,  third  of  Invemahyle,  succeeded  his  father.     He  married  Helen,  daughter 

of  Campbell  of  Dunstaffnage,  by  whom  he  had  issue — -i.  Alexander,  who  succeeded  him  ; 
2.  Dugald  of  Innishaorach,  in  Breadalbane  ;  and  3.  Allan. 

He  lived  a  gentle  and  peaceful  life,  keenly  interested  in  the  improvement  of  his 
lands.  His  marriage  with  a  daughter  of  Dunstaffnage  was  intended  to  end  all  bye-gone 
feuds,  and  restore  peace  betwixt  the  families.  At  first,  however,  it  was  very  bitter  to  his 
father  Donald,  who  could  not  forget  the  soreness  of  the  past,  but  in  the  course  of  time, 
and  by  the  earnest  intercession  of  friends,  he  became  reconciled,  and  made  over  to  the 
young  people  the  lands  of  Innerphuill. 

Y 


Alexander,  fourth  of  Invemahyle,  seems  to  have  played  a  conspicuous  part  in  Mon- 
trose's campaigns,  for,  as  above  noticed  at  page  i66,  we  find  in  the  Acts  of  the  Scots 
ParUament,  anno  1649,  his  name  specially  mentioned,  with  those  of  Lochbuy,  Appin,  and 
Kingerloch,  as  having  been  present  at  Kilsythe  on  15th  August  1644,  and  Inverlochie  on 
2nd  February  1645,  with  the  result  of  being  forfeited  in  land,  person,  and  estate.  He  mar- 
ried a  daughter  of  Duncan  Stewart,  seventh  of  Appin,  by  whom  he  had  twelve  sons,  who  all 
lived  to  the  age  of  manhood.  It  is  recorded  that  Alexander  appeared  in  church  one  day 
accompanied  by  these  twelve  sons,  all  dressed  in  kilts,  with  belted  plaids,  and  in  full  armour. 

Records  of  all  the  descendants  of  the  numerous  family  of  Alexander,  fourth  of  Inver- 
nr.hyle,  have  not  been  handed  down.     He  was  succeeded  by  his  eldest  son

Regiment  (Fraser's),  and  subsequently  fought,  together  with  some  other  High- 
landers, in  the  Royal  cause  during  the  American  Revolution.  He  died  at 
Invemahyle  in  1792.

8.  Mary. 

Duncan  was  out  in  17 15  under  the  Earl  of  Mar,  but  his  father  having  remained  at 
home  the  estate  was  not  forfeited. 

Alexander,  eighth  of  Invemahyle,  married  Catherine,  daughter  of  Robert  Stewart, 
ninth  of  Appin,  and  left  issue — Dugald,  who  succeeded  him,  besides  five  other  sons  and 
nine  daughters. 

Alexander  was  the  very  ideal  of  a  genuine  Highland  gentleman  of  the  olden  time  : 
strict  in  his  integrity,  true  to  his  word,  sensitively  honourable  to  the  verge  of  romance, 
unconscious  of  fear,  yet  tender-hearted  as  a  child.  Sir  Walter  Scott,  when  a  young  man, 
visited  him  often  at  Invemahyle,  and  knew  him  well.  He  thus  speaks  of  him  : — 
"  Alexander  Stewart  of  Invemahyle,  a  name  which  I  cannot  write  without  the  warmest 
recollections  of  gratitude  to  the  friend  of  my  childhood,  who  first  introduced  me  to  the 

Highlands,  their  traditions  and  their  manners He  was  a  noble  specimen  of  the 

old  Highlander — gallant,  courteous,  and  brave  even  to  chivalry." 

He  was  out  in  1715  and  in  1745,  joining  Prince  Charles  with  his  brothers  Allan  and 
James,  and  the  Invemahyle  contingent  On  the  morning  of  the  battle  of  Prestonpans  the 
Camerons  and  Stewarts  of  Appin  made  a  brilliant  charge,  storming  and  capturing  a 
battery  of  four  field-pieces.  Alexander  was  in  the  very  fore-front,  and  noticed  an  officer 
of  King  George's  service  standing  alone,  firmly  grasping  his  sword,  and  evidently  purposing 
to  die  at  his  post.  He  called  on  him  to  surrender,  but  for  reply  received  a  sword  thrust, 
which  he  caught  in  his  target.  The  officer,  who  afterwards  proved  to  be  Colonel  Allan 
Whitefoord  of  Ballochmyle,  being  now  defenceless,  and  the  battle-axe  of  a  gigantic 
Highlander — the  miller  of  Invemahyle— about  to  descend  on  his  head,  reluctantly 
consented  to  yield.  Invemahyle  protected  his  person  and  property,  and  finally  obtained 
his  liberty  on  parole.  Colonel  Whitefoord  was  a  man  of  high  influence  and  character, 
and  between  him  and  his  captor  there  sprung  up  a  warm  friendship  and  regard. 
Invemahyle  visited  Ballochmyle  on  his  journey  northwards  to  raise  more  men  for  Prince 
Charles  when  the  Highland  army  were  retreating  from  England,  and  spent  a  few  days  with 
the  colonel  and  his  Whig  friends  as  pleasantly  as  if  all  had  been  peaceful.  After  Culloden 
it  was  Whitefoord's  turn  to  strain  every  nerve  to  obtain  Invernahyle's  pardon.  Being 
met  everywhere  with  refusals,  he  at  last  went  direct  to  the  Duke  of  Cumberland,  who  also 


decidedly  declined.  He  then  limited  his  request  to  protection  for  Stewart's  house,  wife, 
children,  and  property ;  but  this  also  being  denied  him,  he  laid  his  commission  on  the 
table  before  the  Duke,  and  asked  permission  to  retire  from  the  service  of  a  sovereign  who 
did  not  know  how  to  spare  a  vanquished  enemy.  His  Royal  Highness  was  affected,  and 
at  length  granted  the  request.  A  detachment  of  soldiers  was  accordingly  sent  to  Inver- 
nahyle,  who,  though  they  spared  his  property,  unremittingly  searched  for  his  person.  He 
was  nearer  than  they  thought,  being  hid,  like  the  Baron  of  Bradwardine,  in  a  cave  near  at 
hand.  For  weeks  his  life  was  supported  by  precarious  supplies  brought  to  him  by  a 
daughter  only  eight  years  old,  who  strayed  among  the  soldiers  and  watched  for  the 
moment  when  she  could,  unobserved,  steal  into  the  thicket.  His  sufferings  were  aggravated 
by  an  unhealed  wound  received  at  Culloden.  After  this,  and  when  he  had  at  last 
ventured  to  sleep  in  his  own  house,  he  had  a  remarkable  escape,  being  fired  at  and 
pursued  by  a  party  of  soldiers,  who  noticed  him  leaving  it  in  the  morning.  The  fugitive 
having  escaped,  the  soldiers  returned  and  threatened  the  household  with  punishment  for 
sheltering  one  of  the  proscribed  traitors.  An  old  woman  with  great  presence  of  mind 
said  it  v.'as  the  shepherd.  "  Why,  then,"  said  the  soldiers,  "  did  he  not  stop  when  we 
called  him  ?  "  "  Because,"  was  the  ready  reply,  "  he  is  stone  deaf."  The  shepherd  was 
sent  for,  but  having  been  duly  tutored,  pretended  deafness,  and  the  storm  consequently 
blew  over.  (See  Quarterly  Rei'iew  of  A.'^rW  1817).  Invemahyle  was  afterwards  pardoned 
under  the  Act  of  Indemnity. 

Letters  are  still  in  possession  of  the  family  written  by  I^ochiel  and  Keppoch  to  Inver- 
nahyle,  and  by  him  to  Donald  Campbell,  governor  of  Eilean-'n-Stalcair,  which  give  a 
vivid  picture  of  the  events  occurring  in  those  troublous  times,  as  well  as  the  culture, 
principles,  and  feelings  of  the  Highland  gentlemen  who  were  so  deeply  involved  in 
them. 

The  first  of  these,  addressed  to  Invemahyle,  and  dated  from  Glen  Nevis,  20th  March 
1746,  is  as  follows  : — 

Sir, — Yesternight  we  received  a  letter  from  Clunie,  giving  an  account  of  the  success 
of  the  party  sent  by  His  Royal  Highness,  under  the  command  of  Lord  George  Murray,  a 
copy  whereof  we  thought  proper  to  send  you  enclosed  ;  and  as  you  happen  for  the  present 
to  be  stationed  contiguous  to  the  Campbells,  it  is  our  special  desire  that  you  instantly 
communicate  to  Airds  the  Sheriff,  and  other  leading  men  among  them,  our  sentiments 
(which,  God  Avilling,  we  are  determined  to  execute),  by  remitting  this  our  letter,  and  the 
enclosed  copy,  to  any  most  convenient  to  you.  It  is  our  opinion  that,  of  all  men  in  Scot- 
land, the  Campbells  had  the  least  reason  of  any  to  engage  in  the  present  war  against  His 
Royal  Highness'  interest,  considering  that  they  have  always  appeared  in  opposition  to  the 
Royal  Family  since  the  reign  of  James  VI.,  and  have  been  guilty  of  so  many  acts  of 


rebellion  and  barbarity  during  that  time,  that  no  injured  Prince  but  would  endeavour  to 
resent  it  when  God  was  pleased  to  put  the  power  in  his  hands.  Yet  his  present  Majesty 
and  His  Royal  Highness  the  Prince  Regent  were  generously  pleased  by  their  respective 
declarations  to  forgive  all  past  miscarriages  to  the  most  violent  and  inveterate  enemy,  and 
even  bury  them  in  oblivion,  provided  they  returned  to  their  allegiance ;  and  though  they 
should  not  appear  personally  in  arms  in  support  of  the  Royal  cause,  yet  their  standing 
neuter  should  entitle  them  to  the  good  graces  of  their  injured  sovereign.  But,  in  spite  of 
all  the  lenity  and  clemency  that  a  prince  could  show  or  promise,  the  Campbells  have 
openly  appeared  with  their  wonted  zeal  for  rebellion  and  usurpation  in  the  most  offensive 
manner ;  nor  could  we  form  a  thought  to  ourselves  that  any  men,  endowed  with  reason 
or  common  sense,  could  use  their  fellow-creatures  with  such  inhumanity  and  barbarity  as 
they  do,  and  of  which  we  have  such  daily  proofs  by  their  burning  of  houses,  stripping  of 
women  and  children  and  exposing  them  to  the  open  fields  and  severity  of  the  weather, 
houghing  of  cattle  and  killing  of  horses — to  enumerate  the  whole  would  be  too  tedious  at 
this  time.  They  must  naturally  reflect  that  we  cannot  but  look  on  such  crueltie  with 
horror  and  detestation,  and,  with  hearts  full  of  revenge,  will  certainly  endeavour  to  make 
reprisals,  and  are  determined  to  apply  to  His  Royal  Highness  for  having  an  order  to  enter 
their  country,  with  full  power  to  act  at  discretion ;  and  if  we  are  lucky  enough  to  obtain 
it,  we  will  shew  them  that  we  are  not  to  make  war  against  women  and  the  brute  creation, 
but  against  men,  as  God  was  pleased  to  put  so  many  of  their  people  into  their  custody. 
We  hope  to  prevail  with  His  Royal  Highness  to  hang  a  Campbell  for  every  house  that 
shall  hereafter  be  burnt  by  them. 

Notwithstanding  of  the  many  scandalous  and  malicious  aspersions  industriously  con- 
trived by  our  enemies  against  us,  the  world  never  hitherto,  since  the  commencement  of 
the  war,  can  impeach  us  with  any  acts  of  hostility  that  had  the  least  tendency  to  such 
cruelty  as  they  exercise  against  us,  though  often  we  had  it  in  our  power,  if  barbarous 
enough  to  execute  it. 

Wien  courage  fails  against  men,  it  always  betrays  cowardice  to  a  degree  to  \'ent  their 
spleen  against  brutes,  houses,  women,  and  children,  who  cannot  resist.  We  are  not 
ignorant  of  their  villianous  intentions  by  the  interrupted  letter  from  the  Sheriff  Airds,  &amp;c. ; 
will  plainly  discover  that  it  was  on  their  application  that  their  general,  Cumberland,  granted 
orders  for  the  burning,  &amp;c.,  which  he  could  not  be  answerable  for  to  a  British  Parliament, 
it  being  most  certain  that  such  barbarity  could  never  be  countenanced  by  any  Christian 
Senate.— We  are,  Sir,  your  most  humble  servants, 

(Signed)         Donald  Cameron  of  Lochiel. 
,,  Alexr.  M'Donald  of  Keppoch. 

F.S.  —  l  cannot  omit  taking  notice  that  my  people  have  been  the  first  that  felt  the 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 


cowardly  barbarity  of  my  pretended  Campbell  friends.     I  shall  desire  to  live  to  have  an 
opportunity  of  thanking  diem  for  it  in  the  open  field. 

(Initialed)         D.  C. 

Invemahyle  forwarded  the  above  letter  to  Donald  Campbell,  governor  of  Eilean- 
'n-Stalcair,  with  the  following  from  himself: — 

Sir, — As  you  have  frequent  opportunities  of  corresponding  with  the  gentlemen  of 
Argyleshire,  I  send  you  the  enclosed  for  their  perusal,  which  I  request  you  will  forward. 
I  am  heartfelt  sorry  that  the  burning  of  houses  and  destruction  of  catrie  is  once  begun  in 
our  country,  which  must  be  hurtful  to  both  parties,  and  a  loss  to  the  conqueror,  and  make 
friends  and  neighbours  that  (wish)  well  to  one  another's  interests  alter  their  sentiments.  I 
own  it  is  the  only  part  of  the  war  that  gives  me  most  trouble.  If  my  friends  and  I  should 
differ  about  the  government  of  the  nation,  I  always  thought  it  was  better  we  decided  in 
the  field  than  bring  our  sentiments  upon  innocent  wives  and  children,  who  may  possibly 
differ  in  sentiments  from  their  parents.  You  may  see  by  the  enclosed  it  is  believed  that 
my  friends  in  Argyleshire  have  been  the  cause  of  this  violent  procedure.  I  shall  be  very 
sorry  it  hold  true,  as  I  still  continue  to  have  a  value  and  friendship  in  private  life  for  them, 
they  being  mosriy  my  good  friends  and  relations  ;  and  I  hope,  if  it  is  in  their  power,  they 
will  put  a  stop  to  it.  I  did  not  choose  to  be  employed  in  forwarding  such  letters,  but  people, 
once  engaged  on  either  side  of  the  question,  must  execute  their  orders. — I  am,  dear  Sir, 
your  humble  servant, 

(Signed)         Alexr.  Stewart  of  Invemahyle. 

Prince  Charles  presented  Alexander  with  a  ring,  lozenge-shaped,  and  containing  a

INNERHADDEN  AND  STRATHGARRY. 

DUNCAN  STEWART,  M.A.,  second  son  of  Donald,  fifth  of  Invernahyle,  was  Epis- 
copal clergyman  of  Dunoon  and  Kilmun,  and  was  deposed  for  not  praying  for 
William  and  Mary  in  1690.  He  subsequently  held  the  living  of  Blair  Athole,  as  the 
parishioners  would  not  admit  a  Presbyterian  minister.  The  Presbytery  of  Dunkeld 
ordained  another  minister  in  1716,  saying  that  Mr  Duncan  Stewart  had  intruded  into  the 
kirks  of  Blair  Athole  and  Stnian ;  that  he  had  never  prayed  for  King  George,  but  only  in 
general  terms  for  the  Sovereign ;  that  he  read  the  thanksgivings  for  the  safe  arrival  of  the 
Pretender;  had  a  great  hand  in  influencing  the  people  to  rebellion  in  17 15,  and  read 
all  the  Proclamations  by  the  Earl  of  Mar.  He  married,  first,  the  daughter  and  heiress 
of  the  Rev.  .(Eneas  Maclaine,  Kilfinan,  second  son  of  Hector  Machine,  Lord  Bishop  of

more ;  2.  Margaret  or  Ann,  married  to  a  brother  of  Stewart  of  Urchoilebeg ;

Jean,  daughter  of  Donald  Stewart   of  Duntaulich.     He  purchased  from  the 
Duke  of  Athole  the  superiority  of  Bun-Rannoch,  etc.     He  died  in  1837  without 
issue,  leaving  Innerhadden  to  the  head  of  the  elder  branch  of  his  family,  Allan 
Duncan  Stewart  of  Strathgarry,  by  whom  it  is  now  possessed.    Alan,  first  of  Inner- 
hadden, inherited  his  father's  attachment  to  the  royal  family  of  Stewart,  took 
arms  for  Prince  Charles  in  1745-6,  and,  after  Culloden,  his  house  was  burned 
and  his  lands  plundered  by  the  soldiers  of  the  Duke  of  Cumberland. 
The  Rev.  Duncan  Stewart  had  four  daughters  by  his  second  marriage — i.  Catharine, 
married  to  Alexander  Stewart  of  Duntaulich,  by  whom  she  had  issue  Donald  ;  2.  A

published  till  1739,  nine  years  after  his  death.  This  book  is  a  standard  work,  and  is 
constantly  referred  to  by  all  later  historians  of  the  Stewarts.     He  died  in  1 730. 

Alexander  Stewart  succeeded  his  father  in  Strathgarry.  He  married  Amelia,  daughter 
of  Robertson  of  Kincraigie,  a  branch  of  the  family  of  Lude,  and  died  about  1749,  leaving

BALLACHELISH,  a.d.  1520. 

Allan  Stewart,  third  son  of  Domhnull-nan-ord  of  Invemahyle,  was  with  his  father  at  the 
battle  of  Pinkie  in  1547,  and  so  demeaned  himself  at  that  engagement  that  he  was  placed 
at  Ballachelish  to  defend  the  ready  entrance  into  Appin  at  that  point,  either  across 
a  narrow  strait  of  Lochleven,  or  down  the  pass  of  Glencoe.  Ballachelish  is  a  corruption 
of  the  t^vo  Gaelic  words,  Bala  and  Chaolas,  and  thus  signifies  the  town  on  the  ferry.  Allan 
married  a  daughter  of  M'Donald  of  Killiechonat,  and  had  two  sons,  Alexander  and 
Donald. 

Alexander  Stewart,  second  of  Ballachelish,  married  Janet,  youngest  daughter  of 
John  Stewart,  brother  of  Invemahyle,  and  had  two  sons — John,  who  succeeded  him,  and 
Alexander.  Also  two  daughters,  Isabel  and  Beatrice.  Alexander  married  a  daughter  of 
Campbell  of  Barcaldine,  and  had  three  sons — Alexander,  of  whom  hereafter,  Donald  and 
Allan. 

John  Stewart,  third  of  Ballachelish,  married  a  daughter  of  Duncan  Stewart  of 
Ardsheal,  but,  having  no  issue,  was  succeeded  by  his  nephew,  Alexander. 

Alexander  Stewart,  fourth  of  Ballachelish,  bom  a.d.  1684,  succeeded  his  uncle. 
He  married,  first,  Anne,  daughter  of  John  Stewart  of  Ardsheal,  but  had  no  issue  ; 
secondly,  Isabel,  daughter  of  Alexander  Stewart  of  Annat,  a  branch  of  the  Stewarts  of 
Ardvorlich,  and  by  her  had  issue— i.  John,  who  succeeded  him;  2.  Alexander,  killed  at 
Culloden,  where  four  of  his  nephews — Duncan,  Donald,  Dugald,  and  Alexander— were 
wounded  ;  3.  a  daughter,  Isabella. 

Alexander  was  present  at  the  battle  of  SherifFmuir  in  1715,  at  Culloden,  and  died  in 
1774  at  a  great  age,  and  was  succeeded  by  his  son,  John. 

John  Stewart,  fifth  of  Ballachelish,  succeeded  his  father,  and  married  Margaret, 
daughter  of  William  Wilson  of  Murrayshall,  and  grand-daughter  of  John  Haldane  of 
Lanrick,  Perthshire.     He  died  1794,  leaving  issue  one  daughter,  Lilias. 

Lilias  Stewart,  sixth  of  Ballachelish,  succeeded  her  father,  and  married  Dugald 


Stuart,  a  captain  in  the  71st  Regiment.  She  died  in  1840,  leaving  issue — i.  Charles,  who 
succeeded,  born  1787;  2.  John,  of  whom  hereafter;  3.  Henry,  died  unmarried;  also  a 
daughter,  Margaret,  who  died  unmarried. 

Charles  Stuart,  seventh  of  Ballachelish,  succeeded  his  mother,  and  married 
Clementina,  daughter  of  Dr  Bartlett  Buchanan.  He  died  in  1855,  leaving  issue — Dugald, 
died  unmarried  in  1872  ;  John;  and  three  daughters. 

John  Stuart,  second  son  of  Lilias  Stewart  of  Ballachelish,  was  born  1793.  He  was 
admitted  to  the  English  Bar  in  1839,  was  subsequently  made  Queen's  Council,  and  in 
1852  was  appointed  Vice-Chancellor.  In  1846  he  was  elected  Member  of  Parliament  for 
Newark,  was  re-elected  in  1847,  ^"d  i"  1852  was  elected  Member  for  Bury  St  Edmunds. 
In  1 86 1  he  purchased  the  lands  of  Lochcarron,  Sheildaig,  and  Kishom.  He  was  appointed 
one  of  Her  Majesty's  Privy  Council  on  his  retirement  from  the  Vice-Chancellorship  in 
187 1.  The  Right  Honourable  Sir  John  Stuart  married  Jessie,  daughter  of  Duncan 
Stewart  of  Inverlochy,  and  died  in  1876,  leaving  issue — 

1.  Dugald  Stuart  of  Lochcarron.     He  married  in  1876  Elizabeth  Margaret  Down- 

ing M'Donald  of  Dalness,  only  child  of  Captain  George  Downing  of  the  Madras 
Army,  and  of  Margaret  Campbell  M'Donald,  daughter  of  Coll  M'Donald  of

INNISCHAORAICH  AND  BOHALLIE. 

Dugald  Stewart,  the  first  of  Innischaoraich,  was  second  son  of  Duncan,  third  of  Inver- 
nahyle.  In  1656  he  purchased  the  lands  of  Innischaoraich  and  others  in  Breadalbane, 
from  Sir  James  Campbell  of  Lawers.  He  married,  and  had  issue — i.  Allan,  who  succeeded 
him;  and  2.  Niel. 

Allan  Stewart  of  Innischaoraich  married  a  daughter  of  Burden  of  Fidals,  and  had 
a  son,  James,  who  succeeded  him. 

James  Stewart  of  Innischaoraich  married  a  daughter  of  Stewart  of  Annat,  and  had 
two  sons,  who  died  immarried. 

Niel  Stewart  of  Botuamie  and  Tullich  in  Glenlochay,  afterwards  of  Edravinnoch 
in  Glendochart,  succeeded  as  heir  to  his  nephew,  James.  He  married,  first,  Jean, 
daughter  of  William  Stewart  of  Drumchary  in  Fortingall,  by  whom  he  had  John,  who  suc- 
ceeded him ;  and,  secondly,  Jane  Campbell,  by  whom  he  had  no  issue. 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  183 

In  an  incursion  by  Ian  Glas,  the  first  Earl  of  Breadalbane,  against  the  Sinclairs  of 
Caithness  in  1680,  Niel  was  in  command  of  the  western  division  of  the  Breadalbane  men  ; 
and  at  the  battle  of  AUt-na-Meirleach,  near  Wick,  where  the  Sinclairs  were  defeated,  and 
many  of  them  slain ;  he  fought  with  such  prowess  at  lan's  right  hand,  that  it  still  forms 
subject  of  fireside  talk  in  Breadalbane.  The  sword  carried  by  Niel  on  this  occasion 
is  still  intimately  associated  with  the  same  division  of  the  Breadalbane  Highlanders,  and 
worn  by  one  of  his  descendants  at  their  parades. 

John  Stewart,  of  Edravinnoch,  succeeded  his  father  at  his  death  in  1737,  but  only 
survived  him  by  a  few  months.  He  married  his  cousin,  Isabel,  daughter  of  Patrick 
Stewart  of  Drumchary,  by  whom  he  had  Charles,  who  succeeded  him.  He  was  out  in 
1 7 15,  under  the  Earl  of  Mar,  and  severely  wounded.  He  described  himself  as  surrounded 
by  his  assailants,  like  a  stag  amidst  a  pack  of  hounds,  and  obliged  to  fight  his  way 
through  them. 

Charles  Stewart  of  Edravinnoch,  afterwards  of  Bohallie,  well  known  for  his 
chivalrous  bearing,  succeeded  his  father,  John.  His  relative.  General  David  Stewart  of 
Drumchary  and  Garth,  in  his  "  Sketches  of  Highlanders,"  thus  describes  him  :  "  This 
gentleman  was  remarkable  for  his  strength  and  activity,  and  one  of  the  best  swordsmen  of 
his  time,  in  an  age  when  good  swordsmanship  was  common,  and  considered  an  indispensable 
and  graceful  accomplishment  of  a  gentleman."  He  was  out  with  the  clan  in  the  'forty-five, 
and  severely  wounded  at  CuUoden.  At  the  very  hottest  of  the  fight  his  sword  broke,  but 
hastily  snatching  up  one  from  the  side  of  a  slain  comrade,  he  fiercely  continued  the  struggle. 
This  sword  is  now  in  possession  of  C.  A.  M'Diarmid  of  Rockwood.  He  was  helped  by  a 
friend  from  the  field  of  batde,  and  mounted  on  an  old  white  horse  fortunately  caught 
amongst  the  hills,  and  so  brought  home  to  Bohallie.  In  the  year  following,  a  detachment 
of  soldiers  was  sent  to  pacify  that  district  of  Athole,  and  he,  along  with  the  Stewart  lairds 
of  Foss  and  Duntaulich,  had  to  go  into  hiding  in  the  wood  of  Kynachan.  The  watch  was 
very  close,  and  they  were  saved  from  frequent  want  by  the  tact  of  the  dairymaid,  who 
drove  the  milk  cows  daily  through  the  wood,  and  in  their  direction.  The  officers  were 
quartered  upon  DaNad  Stewart  of  Kynachan,  to  whose  sister,  Clementina,  Charles  was 
engaged  in  marriage,  and  it  so  happened  that  one  evening  as  she  was  in  the  sitting-room 
spinning  her  wheel — the  useful  accomplishment  of  Highland  ladies  in  those  times — and 
talking  to  the  officers,  a  servant  entered  and  said  she  was  wanted  in  the  kitchen.  Laying 
aside  her  wheel,  and  apologizing  for  her  absence,  she  followed  the  servant,  and  found 
Charles,  who  had  come  in  by  a  back  window,  accompanied  by  a  clergyman,  waiting 
for  her.  The  marriage  ceremony  was  soon  over,  and  Charles  having  attained  his  wish  of 
leaving  her,  in  the  event  of  his  death,  with  the  position  and  benefits  accruing  to  his  widow, 
returned  by  the  back  window  to  his  hiding-place,  whilst  Clementina,  with  a  happy  yet 
anxious  heart,  returned  to  her  entertainment  of  the  officers. 


It  may  be  mentioned  that  David  was  wounded  at  CuUoden,  and  as  he  never  returned 
to  Kynachan,  an  uncertainty  hangs  over  his  fate.  He  was  last  seen  with  a  broken 
sword  in  his  hand,  fighting  against  two  dragoons,  who  were  sorely  pressing  him.  He  was 
taken  prisoner,  it  is  said,  and  along  with  some  others  of  mark,  confined  in  a  barn,  which 
was  set  fire  to  by  orders  of  Cumberland,  and  the  prisoners  shot  as  they  tried  to  escape. 
His  name  afterwards  appears  in  the  list  of  those  excluded  from  the  benefits  of  the  Act  of 
Indemnity. 

By  Clementina,  Charles  had  Elizabeth,  who  succeeded  him,  and  three  other  daugh- 
ters, Jean,  Anne,  and  Euphemia. 

Elizabeth  Stewart  of  Bohallie,  married  John  M'Diarmid,  Dunark,  and  had  issue — 
I.  Charles  M'Diarmid  of  Bohallie,  who  married  Jane,  daughter  of  John  Stewart  of  Foss, 
and  left  issue,  Charles  Alexander  M'Diarmid  of  Rockwood,  Killin,  and  Donald  Alexander 
M'Diarmid,  Killiemore ;  2.  Grace,  who  married  Donald  Stewart  of  Glencripesdale  (of  the 
family  of  James  Stewart  of  The  Glens),  and  had  issue — r.  Alexander  Stewart  of  Glencripes- 
dale, who  married  Isabella,  daughter  of  Joseph  Stewart  of  Foss,  by  whom  he  has  left  a 
daughter,  Margaret,' married  to  Alexander  Gallaway,  Huntershill, ;  2.  Charles  Stewart  of 
Tighnduin,  Killin ;  3.  Elizabeth,  who  married  John  Stewart  of  Findynate,  and  left  issue ; 
and  4.  Clementina,  who  married  her  cousin,  C.  A,  M'Diarmid. 


SLIOCHD  AILEIN  'IC  ROB. 

THIS  sept  of  the  clan  Stewart,  commonly  called  the  "  M'Robs,"  received  their  name 
in  consequence  of  their  descent  from  a  natural  son  of  Robert  Stewart^  son  of 
Dugald,  first  of  Appin.  The  name  of  this  illegitimate  son  seems  to  have  been  Alan,  and 
he  apparently  had  a  son  called  Robert ;  for  the  sept  was  sometimes  spoken  of  by  the 
seannachies  of  the  clan  as  Sliochd  Rob  Ailein  Tc  Rob,  or  the  descendants  of  Robert,  son 
of  Alan,  who  was  son  of  Robert.  As  early  as  the  wars  of  Montrose,  the  "  MacRobs  " 
could  of  themselves,  on  an  emergency,  muster  fifty  broadswords  so  trusty  and  true,  that 
an  old  bard  of  the  sept  speaks  of  them  as  the  "  back-bone  "  of  the  clan, — 

"  Cnaimh  droma  mo  chinnidh 

Bras  'am  mire  nan  treun  chath." 
("  The  back-bone  of  our  clan. 

Eager  in  the  excitement  of  the  battles  of  heroes.") 

The  lands  occupied  by  the  "  MacRobs  "  were  Glenduror,  Lettermore,  and  Acharn 
in  Duror,  which  they  held  at  first  from  Appin,  but  afterwards  from  Ardsheal,  paying  but 
a  nominal  rent,  and  looking  upon  their  possessions  almost  as  their  own,  subject  only  to 
the  small  rent  payable  by  them.     When  in  the  winter  of  1644-5  Montrose  made  his 


memorable  raid  into  the  country  of  the  Campbells,  so  graphically  described  in  the 
"  Legend  of  Montrose,"  the  sept,  as  usual,  formed  part  of  the  Appin  regiment,  and  so 
distinguished  themselves  that  their  prowess  was  specially  alluded  to  in  the  following  verse 
of  a  poem  written  to  commemorate  Montrose's  brilliant  campaign  in  the  West  High- 
land's : — 

"  Thugh  sibh  an  sgriob  a  bha  fearail 
Null  gu  fearann  nan  Drumhneach, 
Deadh  Chlann  Ian  on  Innean 
'S  clann  Ailein-ic-Rob  o  Ghleannduror." 
"  That  was  a  gallant  raid  of  yours 
Into  the  lands  of  the  Campbells, 
Bold  Maclans  from  Glencoe's  steep  stithy. 
With  the  brave  MacAllans-MacRobs  of  Glenduror." 

When,  after  the  battle  of  Culloden,  Charles  Stewart,  fifth  of  Ardsheal,  upon  whose 
lands  they  lived,  was  in  exile  in  France,  the  "  MacRobs  "  voluntarily  assessed  themselves 
in  the  sum  of  one  hundred  pounds, — a  large  sum  in  those  days, — which  they  sent  to  Ard- 
sheal by  a  secret  messenger,  though  they  were  at  the  same  time  paying  a  considerable 
rent  to  the  Government.  At  the  time  when  the  Appin  estate  was  sold,  Allan  Stewart, 
a  "  MacRob,"  an  active  and  well-known  man  in  Appin,  was  tenant  of  the  island  of  Shuna, 
and  was  the  subject  of  several  verses  still  current  in  the  Strath.  He  had  a  numerous 
family,  and  some  of  his  sons  rose  to  distinction  in  the  military  and  civil  services.  Towards 
the  end  of  last  century  many  of  the  "  MacRobs  "  emigrated  to  America,  where  they 
acquired  extensive  lands,  held  by  their  descendants  at  the  present  day. 

The  foregoing  account  of  the  "  MacRobs"  is  by  die  Rev.  Alexander  Stewart,  F.S.A. 
Scot.,  and  F.R.P.S.E.,  minister  of  the  parish  of  Ballachelish  and  Ardgour.  Mr  Stewart  is 
well  known  as  an  accomplished  naturalist  and  litterateur  under  the  name  of  "  Nether  Loch- 
aber."  He  is  descended  from  Stewarts  on  both  sides  of  the  house  for  nine  generations, 
his  descent  on  the  male  side  being  from  the  Sliochd  Ailein  'ic  Rob.  In  1 7 1 5  Donald 
Stewart  "  MacRob  "  was  tenant  in  Lettermore,  and  was  wounded  in  the  knee  at  Sheriffmuir, 
being  known  thereafter  as  Domhnuill  crubach  na  Leitrich-more.  He  died  at  Letter-shuna 
in  1 731,  leaving  two  sons.  The  eldest,  James,  an  Episcopal  clergyman,  died  unmarried; 
the  second,  Robert,  succeeded  his  father  in  Lettermore.  Robert  fought  at  Culloden,  and 
for  some  time  after  the  battle  was  in  hiding,  but  after  the  Act  of  Indemnity  returned  to 
Lettermore.  He  died  about  1768,  leaving  by  his  wife,  who  was  of  the  family  of  Glen- 
buckie,  a  son  James,  who  was  for  many  years  a  tenant  of  a  large  grazing  in  Glenfinlas. 
James'  son,  Peter,  died  in  1793,  well  known  and  much  respected  as  the  schoolmaster  of 
Ardgour.  His  son,  David,  for  fifty  years  an  officer  of  the  Inland  Revenue,  was  father  of 
the  Rev.  Alexander  Stewart,  "  Nether  Lochaber,"  whose  writings  have  done  so  much  to 
make  the  public  acquainted  with  the  legends  and  natural  history  of  the  West  Highlands.

bonis   ascrutatis   et    non    repertis    pro    dicta    summa    distringibilis   non    extitit,    ideo 


sibi  per  nostras  alias  literas  per  deliberacionem  dictorum  dominorum  postea  directas, 
precepimus  et  mandavimus  quod  ipse  Lauchlanus  infra  quadraginta  dies  huiusmodi

Duncanum  nobis  in  tenentem  earundem  recipere  volumus,  prout  in  dictis  nostris 
Hteris  per  dilectum  nostrum  Dauid  Tempilman  nuncium  et  vicecomitem  nostrum

Lauchlanus  sasinam  dictarum  terrarum  et  hereditatis  sue  accipere  recusauit,  et  ad 
easdem  intrare  noluit,  secundum  tenorem  huiusmodi  literarum  nostrarum,  lapsis  dictis 
quadraginta  diebus  completis,  ad  huiusmodi  sasinam  in  fraudem  et  preiudicium 
sepedicti  Duncani  sui  creditoris  omnino  postposuit,  ideo  prefati  consilii  nostri 
Domini  nobis  consuluerunt  ad  recipiendum  ipsum  Duncanum  nobis  in  tenentem  de

millium  et  quingentarum  mercarum,  et  ipsum  in  eisdem  infeodare  per  cartam  et 
sasinam  nostras.  Et  nos  huiusmodi  consilium  perutile  et  racioni  consonum  con- 
siderantes,  ideo  dedimus  et  concessimus  et  confirmauimus,  et  hac  presenti  carta

Copy  of  a  statement  made  in  writing  by  Alexander  Stewart  of  Ballachelish  soon 
after  the  battle  of  Killiecrankie,  in  a  letter  to  Invemahyle. 

"  I  SHALL  give  you  as  good  an  account  as  I  can  of  the  man  who  appeared  to  us  last 
summer  in  so  extraordinary  a  way.  Everything  about  it  is  so  strongly  in  my  mind  as  at 
the  time  he  was  with  us,  and  I  think  I  will  never  lose  the  memory  of  it  When  Lochiel 
got  letters  from  Claverhouse,  he  came  to  see  Appin  upon  them.  We  all  went  to  Letter- 
shuna  to  meet  them ;  everything  was  settled  overnight,  and  Lochiel  came  on  with  me  the 
day  after,  and  slept  that  night  with  us.  Next  day  I  put  him  over  the  loch  ;  it  was  a  grey 
morning,  but  it  cleared  up,  and  was  a  fine  warm  day,  without  any  wind.  When  I  came 
back  I  went  up  to  the  Knap  (a  knoll  near  Ballachelish),  and  lay  down  in  the  sun ;  my  dog 
Brandt  was  lying  by  me.  I  was  there  for  some  time  between  sleeping  and  waking,  and 
thinking  upon  the  business  we  had  been  speaking  about,  when  Brandt  started  up  and 
began  to  bark.  I  looked  up  and  saw  a  man  coming  over  the  moss  to  where  I  was.  I 
rose  up,  and  I  observed  as  he  was  walking  to  me  that  he  had  a  long  Spanish  gun  in  his 
hand.  When  he  came  up  he  spoke  to  me  by  my  name,  which  I  was  surprised  at,  as  I 
had  never  seen  him  before.  After  some  speaking,  he  told  that  he  was  a  gentleman  who 
had  got  into  trouble,  and  that  he  had  come  into  that  part  of  the  country  to  be  out  of  the 
way.  He  said  he  could  not  then  tell  me  what  his  name  was,  for  it  would  be  as  much  as 
his  life  was  worth,  and  that  he  must  keep  as  private  as  possible,  that  he  would,  with  my 
leave,  come  and  take  his  food  with  me,  and,  as  the  surest  way  not  to  be  known,  that  he 
would  wish  not  to  say  a  word  when  he  was  with  us.  He  then  said  that  if  I  did  not  think 
it  necessary,  he  would  be  better  pleased  if  I  took  no  notice  at  home  of  his  having  met 
me,  as  he  thought  there  would  not  be  so  great  a  chance  of  his  being  found  out  if  we  all 
seemed  to  know  nothing  about  him.  I  told  him  that  he  would  be  perfectly  safe  wth  me, 
whoever  he  might  be,  and  I  hoped  he  would  sleep  in  the  house  as  well  as  take  his  meat 
with  us,  and  that  I  would  promise  my  head  that  no  harm  should  happen  to  him  from  any 
one  while  he  was  with  me.  I  said,  too,  that  I  would  trouble  him  with  no  questions,  that 
he  might  do  just  as  he  pleased,  but  that  I  was  not  sure  that  it  was  the  best  way  witli  my 
wife  to  keep  silence  altogether,  for  the  more  secret  there  was,  the  more  anxious  she  would 
be  to  find  it  out,  and  that  it  would  be  better  to  tell  her  some  story  that  would  keep  her 


THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN.  207 

quiet ;  yet,  that  I  was  ready  to  do  whatever  he  thought  most  Hkely  to  keep  him  most  safely. 
He  answered  that  it  would  be  the  surest  plan  to  be  altogether  silent,  and  that  it  would  be 
better  to  leave  my  wife  to  make  anything  of  it  she  could,  as  he  would  take  every  care  to 
let  that  be  as  little  as  possible.  He  said  he  was  obliged  to  me  for  my  offer  of  shelter, 
but  that  he  was  in  so  much  danger  that  he  would  keep  from  going  amongst  other  people 
as  much  as  he  could,  and  ended  by  saying  that  he  hoped  the  time  would  come  when  he 
would  be  able  to  thank  me  openly  for  my  kindness,  if  I  would  oblige  him  in  these  things. 
I  then  said  that  any  gentleman  in  distress  would  always  have  my  best  assistance,  still  that 
I  was  sorry  he  did  not  put  himself  entirely  into  my  hands,  that  I  might  be  the  better  able 
to  be  answerable  for  his  life ;  however,  whatever  he  thought  the  best  way  he  might 
depend  upon  it  that  I  would  do  everything  I  could  to  keep  him  from  harm.  He  then 
left  me.  This  was  all  that  passed  between  us.  While  we  were  in  conversation,  I 
observed  him  very  particularly.  He  was  a  man,  to  appearance,  of  about  thirty  years  of 
age,  and  something  above  the  middle  size.  He  was  not  a  very  strong-looking  man,  but 
he  was  clean  made  and  well  put  together ;  he  was  good-looking  in  the  face,  with  some 
few  marks  of  the  smallpox,  but  not  very  many.  He  had  a  straight  nose,  and  there  was  a 
great  deal  of  fire  in  his  eyes  when  he  spoke ;  his  hair  was  of  a  dark  brown  colour,  and 
altogether  no  man  could  doubt  that  he  was  a  gentleman.  His  Gaelic  was  like  that  which 
is  spoken  in  the  Isles,  and  I  noticed  that  when  he  put  out  his  right  hand  in  speaking, 
tliat  there  was  a  cloth  about  it,  as  if  it  had  been  hurt.  His  clothes  were  of  a  red  and 
green  dark  set,  and  his  arms  seemed  to  be  very  good.  When  he  had  gone  a  little  way, 
he  turned  and  made  a  sign  to  me.  I  walked  home  wondering  who  he  could  be.  I  told 
Beatrice  that  as  the  country  was  astir  that  it  would  be  as  well  to  have  always  plenty  of 
meat  ready.  Wlien  it  was  near  night  there  was  no  word  of  him,  and  I  began  to  doubt 
that  he  would  come  ;  but  just  as  we  were  sitting  down  he  stepped  in.  When  he  entered 
he  said,  and  went  and  laid  his  gun  and  sword  in  a  corner, 

and  drew  up  to  the  table.  I  said  he  was  very  welcome,  and  asked  where  he  had  come 
from,  but  he  gave  no  answer.  I  put  two  or  three  questions  to  him,  but  seeing  he  was 
not  inclined  to  speak,  I  said  that  as  the  gentleman  might  have  reasons  for  his  silence,  we 
would  not  trouble  him  at  present,  but  I  hoped  he  would  give  us  his  news  by-and-bye. 
Every  person  looked  much  surprised,  and  very  little  was  said,  and  I  beheve  that  very 
little  was  eaten,  but  the  stranger  eat  heartily.  When  we  had  done  he  took  his  gun  and 
sword  and  went  out  again,  looking  very  sorrowful,  and  appearing  to  be  much  cast  down. 
After  he  was  gone  there  was  nothing  but  wondering  who  he  could  be.  We  were  all  very 
uneasy.  In  the  morning  he  came  again,  and  went  away  as  before.  It  was  got  amongst 
the  people,  and  they  did  not  like  it  as  they  were  so  soon  to  go  out ;  they  thought  it  was 
a  bad  sign.  Old  John  Lome  swore  that  he  would  make  him  speak,  cost  what  it  would. 
I  told  them  he  could  be  nothing  but  an  unfortunate  gentleman  who  had  come  amongst 


2oS  THE  STEWARTS  OF  APPIN. 

us  for  safety,  and  that  no  man  should  touch  him  while  in  my  hands.  They  were  not 
easily  satisfied,  and  they  were  detennined  to  find  him  out,  and  have  from  him  what  he 
was,  but  I  kept  them  quiet,  and  desired  that  no  man  should  go  after  him.  He  continued 
to  come  and  go  in  this  way  for  three  days,  and  although  I  always  spoke  to  him  when  he 
entered  the  house,  he  never  said  a  word  to  me  again,  but  he  was  always  very  civil. 
Nobody  ever  saw  anything  of  him  during  the  day,  but  when  night  was  coming  on  he  was 
observed  to  come  out  of  the  glen.  The  people  did  not  know  what  to  make  of  him,  and 
after  all  their  brave  speaking  at  first,  none  of  them  could  find  heart  to  go  near  him  when 
he  was  to  be  seen,  and  when  they  went  to  the  hill  they  would  go  two  or  three  together, 
but  none  of  them  ever  met  him.  When  he  would  come  in  before  the  meat  was  ready  he 
would  sit  down,  but  still  he  never  spoke  a  word.  He  would  look  much  at  the  children, 
and  took  great  notice  of  them,  and  he  made  much  of  Hector,  who  is  gro\ving  a  fine  lad, 
and  after  the  first  while,  when  he  went  near  him,  he  would  show  him  his  dirk  and  his 
pistols,  which  had  the  Doune  mark  on  them,  but  he  never  spoke  a  word.  On  the  fourth 
day  it  was  rainy  with  a  high  wind,  and  he  did  not  come  in  the  nxorning,  at  night  there 
was  no  appearance  of  him,  and  we  began  to  think  he  had  left  us,  which  I  was  very  thank- 
ful for.  I  did  not  grudge  him  his  meat  and  drink,  poor  man,  but  I  did  not  like  his 
coming  and  going  without  telling  us  anything  about  himself;  I  was  afraid  his  appearance 
was  to  warn  me  of  some  misfortune,  but  I  said  nothing. 

"We  were  all  busy  getting  ready  to  meet  Dundee,  and  I  began  to  think  less  about  him. 
The  people,  now  that  he  was  away,  were  making  their  joke  of  it,  and  hoping  that  I  would 
never  have  such  another  stranger. 

"At  Rin  Ruarie  (Killiecrankie)  I  was  hurt  in  the  hand,  and  I  afterwards  remembered 
that  it  was  in  the  same  hand  that  this  man  had  tied  up.  When  we  went  down  to  Dunkeld 
I  was  sitting  by  myself  in  a  house  where  we  were,  all  the  people  being  gone  out  to  kill  a 
cow  they  had  got.  It  was  towards  evening,  and  it  was  very  hot.  The  door  was  opened, 
and  the  same  man  came  in ;  he  was  looking  as  when  I  saw  him  before,  with  the  same 
sorrowful  look.  I  said  to  him  there  could  be  no  reason  for  his  concealing  himself  now, 
as  he  had  come  amongst  so  many  people,  and  that  I  hoped  he  would  let  me  know  who 
he  was.  He  replied  that  he  was  sorry  that  was  not  yet  in  his  power,  but  that  he  could 
not  be  near  me  without  coming  to  thank  me  for  the  way  I  had  behaved  to  him,  but  that 
we  should  meet  again.  Upon  saying  this  he  immediately  went  out  I  followed  him,  but 
I  could  not  see  him ;  and  although  I  asked  all  that  I  met  whether  they  had  seen  such  a 
man,  I  could  hear  nothing  of  him.  Next  day  we  tried  to  take  the  Cathedral,  and  poor 
Sandy  was  killed.  I  now  think  he  was  sent  to  warn  me  of  this ;  and  yet  in  the  way  he 
spoke  there  was  nothing  different  from  other  men,  and  nobody  thought  he  was  anything 
else  but  a  gentleman.  It  is  now  ten  months  since  he  came  amongst  us,  and  I  have  never 
been  able  to  hear  more  of  him.     It  has  ahva)s  been  very  heavy  on  my  mind,  but  I  say

nothing,  whether  it  means  anything  more  than  has  yet  happened  God  knows,  but  his  will 
be  done,  which  ever  way  it  is." 

It  is  understood  that  the  "  man  "  turned  out  to  be  a  Macdonald,  who  had  been 
obliged  to  fly  from  his  own  clan  to  avoid  the  vengeance  of  his  neighbours  for  some  offence 
he  had  committed.

THE    APPIN   MURDER 


TO  THE  EDITOR  OF  THE  TIMES 

Sir, — While  perhaps  little  further  enlightei 
merit  can  now  be  expected  on  the  Appjr 
murder,  the  otherwise  admirable  account  ol 
that  tragedy  given  by  your  Special  Corre^ 
spondent  in  a  recent  issue  of  The  Times  tends 
to  leave  a  somewhat  dubious  impression  of  the 
ethical  nature  of  the  subseqirenl  trial.  Like 
so  many  others,  your  Correspondent  has 
allowed  his  very  natural  sympathy  for  the 
harshly  treated  Stewarts  to  lead  him  into  the 
(in  my  opinion)  unwarranted  assumption  that 
the  trial  of  James  of  the  Glen  was  a  travesty 
of  justice.  That  assumption  is  quite  unfair  to 
Campbells,  who,  for  all  their  faults,  were 
staunch  upholders  of  judicial  rectitude. 
Consequently,  the  fact  that  Argyll  himself  pre- 
sided at  that  fateful  trial  200  years  ago  ensured 
for  James  of  the  Glen  whatever  judicial  con- 
sideration was  available  at  the  time.  It  is  very 
far  from  my  intention  to  make  these  observa- 
tions in  order  to  mitigate  in  the  least  the  whole- 
some abhorrence  of  the  pitiably  inadequate 
form  of  justice,  the  ministration  of  which 
could,  at  the  time  under  consideration,  send 
James  of  the  Glen  to  his  death.  Rather 
they  made  in  order  to  draw  attention  to  the 
fact  that  this  dark  spot,  in  history  does  not 
necessarily  lie  at  the  door  of  the  Campbells. 
I  am,  Sir,  yours  faithfully, 

T.  URE. 
201,  Rivermead  Court,  Hurlingham,  S.W.6 


Sir, — Your  Special  Correspondent  does  not 
mention  that  the  place  of  James  Stewart's 
execution  is  now  marked  by  a  monument.  This 
bears  the  unequivocal  inscription: — "  Erected 
in  1911  to  the  memory  of  James  Stewart  of 
Acharn,  or  James  of  liie  Glens,  executed  on 
this  spot  Nqv.  8,  1752,  for  a  crime  of  which 
he  was  not  guilty." 

Yours  faithfully, 

RODNEY  M.  GALEY.

THE    APPIN    MURDER 


MYSTERY    UNSOLVED    AFTER 
TWO   HUNDRED   YEARS 

From  Our  Special  Correspondent 


The  story  of  the  Appin  murder-the 
murder  of  Colin  Campbell  of  Glcnure 
in  the  woods  of  Lettermore  two  hundrc.i 
years  ago  to-day — has  gone  round  the 
world  in  the  pages  of  Kidnapped.  "  There 
came  the  shot  of  a  firelock  from  higher 
up  the  hill ;  and  with  the  very  sound  of 
it  Glenure  fell  upon  the  road.  'O,  1  am 
dead,'  he  cried,  several  times  over."  David 
Balfour  loolied  up  the  hill.  "  The  murderer 
was  still  moving  away  at  no  great 
distance.  He  was  a  big  man,  in  a  black 
coat,  with  metal  buttons,  and  carried  a 
fowling-piece.  .  ,  .  The  next  moment  he 
was  lost  in  a  fringe  of  birches." 

In  history  there  was  no  David  Balfour 
to  witness  the  shooting,  but  the  res^of  it 
happened  very  much  as  Stevenson  des- 
s.  and  the  mystery  is  unsolved  to  this 


day.  Who  was  the  man  in  the  black  coat  ? 
Some  few  families  in  the  Appin  district 
have  had  what  is  believed  to  be  the  secret 
handed  down  to  them,  but  they  keep  it 
to  themselves.  Most  people  who  have 
studied  the  old  records  agree  that  James 
Stewart  of  the  Glen,  hanged  on  a  high 
knoll  near  the  south  landing  at  Ballachu- 
lish  ferry  on  November  8,  1752,  for  being 
an  accomplice,  "  art  and  part  of  the 
murder,"  was  in  fact  innocent.  Alan 
Breck  Stewart — not  quite  so  attrac- 
tive a  character  as  Stevenson  made  him, 
but  still  recognizable  in  the  old  records — 
was  certainly  lurking  near  at  hand  at  the 
hour  of  the  murder  and  is  commonly 
thought  to  have  shared  in  the  plan. 
According  to  local  tradition,  however,  it 
was  not  his  hand  that  fired  the  long  black 
gun, 

HIGHLAND   BELIEF 

Everything  combines  to  malje  the 
mystery  live  on  in  Highland  minds.  There 
is  the  unshakable  belief  that  James  of 
the  Glen  was  hanged  by  an  act  of  Govern- 
ment policy  an*  clan  vengeance.  The 
Highlands  in  1752  were  still  restive  after 
the  '45,  there  were  rumours  that  Prince 
Charles  would  land  again  with  a  Swedish 
force  ;  and  a  lesson  had  to  be  taught  even 
though  the  real  murderer  was  unknown. 
A  Campbell  had  been  murdered  in 
Stewart  country,  so  a  leading  Stewart 
representative  in  the  district  had  to  pay 
after  a  trial  presided  over  by  the  Duke  of 


borrow  as  he  moved  from  place  to  place. 
From  James's  house,  when  he  arrived 
there,  he  borrowed  a  short  black  coat  and 
some  blue  piaiden  trousers — much  the 
kind  of  dress  that  the  murderer  was  seen 

e  wearing,  but  it  was  a  dress  fairly 

Tion   in  the   Highlands  at  the   time. 

I  .spent  some  days  visiting  younger 
people  at  Ballachulish  and  Fasnacloich. 
nd  on  May  1 1  Alan  and  a  few  young 
people  spent  the  night — some  sleeping  in 

barn — at   James's   farm    at   Acharn. 

1  undoubtedly  had  spoken  wildly 
against  Glenure  at  different  times,  and 
these  meetings  of  his  with  young  men  may 
be  significant,  for  to  this  day  it  is  said 
in  Appin  that  the  murder  was  plotted  by 
some  young  folk. 

Alan,  at  any  rate,  had  little  talk  with 
James  himself  on  the  night  of  May  II  ; 
they  had  no  time  to  work  out  an  elaborate 
plot  of  murder  and  escape.  On  May  12 
Alan  left  Acharn  early  and  visited  friends 
around  Loch  Leven  and  Glencoe.  The 
night  of  May  L't  he  spent  at  Ballachulish 
House,  and  the  next  morning — the  day  of 
the  murder — he  worked  a  little  in  the 
farmyard  and  then  disappeared  with  a 
fishing  rod.  Glenure  was  expected  to 
ride  from  Fort  William  during  the  day, 
crossing  over  the  Ballachulish  ferry  to 
the  Appin  side.  During  the  day  Alan 
appeared  again  to  ask  the  ferryman  at 
Ballachulish  south  landing  if  Glenure  had 
crossed.  On  being  told  "  No,"  he  was 
away  again  into  the  hill.  Glenure  later 
crossed  the  ferry,  rode  on  a  mile  or  two 
along  the  narrow  hillside  road  (now  grass- 
coveredl  towards  Duror,  and  was  shot 
at  a  place  still  marked  by  a  small  heap 
of  stones.  His  young  lawyer,  who  was 
among  the  few  with  him,  had  the  glimpse 
of  the  murderer. 

Later  in  the  evening  Alan,  still  in  the 
neighbourhood,  met  a  servant  girl  from 
Ballachulish  House  on  the  hill,  asked 
"  what  was  the  occasion  of  the  stir  in  the 
town,"  and,  on  being  told  that  Glenure 
was  killed,  asked  her  to  tell  a  Donald 
Stewart  to  get  money  for  him  from  James 
of  the  Glen.  Donald  .Stewart  then  went 
up  the  brae  to  meet  Alan,  who  told  him 
to  tell  James  that  he  would  wait  for  the 
money  at  Coalisnacoan,  by  the  side  of 
Loch  Leven.  Donald  Stewart  duly  saw 
James  the  next  day  and  James  arranged 
for  the  money  to  be  sent. 

All  this  was  used  against  James  at  the 
trial ;  but  if  James  had  had  foreknowledge 
of  the  murder,  and  had  promised  to  help 
in  Alan's  escape,  he  would  surely  have 
arranged  the  money  beforehand,  not  leav- 
ing it  to  be  arranged  in  haste  afterwards. 
James  sent  the  money  because  Alan 
Breck  was  a  kinsman,  a  former  deserter 
from  the  Hanoverian  forces,  and  a  man 
who  would  certainly  be  hanged  if  caught. 
Thanks  to  the  money  and  his  native  wit, 
Alan  was  soon  safely  in  France. 

WITNESSES'   VAGUENESS 

The  case  against  Alan  is  black  and,  were 
it  nnt  fnr  the  strnni!  local  tradition  that  he 


Breck  Stewart — not  quite  so  attrac- 
tive a  character  as  Stevenson  made  him. 
but  still  recognizable  in  the  old  records- 
was  certainly  lurking  near  at  hand  at  the 
hour  of  the  murder  and  is  commonly 
thought  to  have  shared  in  the  plan. 
According  to  local  tradition,  however,  it 
was  not  his  hand  that  fired  the  long  black 
gun. 

HIGHLAND  BELIEF 
Everything  combines  to  make  the 
mystery  live  on  in  Highland  minds.  There 
is  the  unshakable  belief  that  James  of 
the  Glen  was  hanged  by  an  act  of  Govern- 
ment policy  ancft  clan  vengeance.  The 
Highlands  in  1752  were  still  restive  after 
the  '45,  there  were  rumours  that  Prince 
Charles  would  land  again  with  a  S\H'edish 
force  :  and  a  lesson  had  to  be  taught  even 
though  the  real  murderer  was  unknown. 
A  Campbell  had  been  murdered  in 
Stewart  country,  so  a  leading  Stewart 
representative  in  the  district  had  to  pay — 
after  a  trial  presided  over  by  the  Duke  of 
Argyll  himself  with  a  jury  made  up  almost 
entirely  of  Campbells. 

The  main  facts  in  the  case  are  fairly 
clear.  After  the  '45,  Stewart  of  Ardshie'l 
fled  with  many  others  to  France ;  and 
James  of  the  Glen,  a  natural  brother  of 
Ardshicl's,  managed  his  estate  in  .\ppin 
for  him  for  a  time.  Then  the  estate  was 
taken  over  by  the  Government  and  C  amp- 
bell  of  Glenure  was  made  the  factor  over 
Glenure  was  at  first  content  lo  let 
James  go  on  collecting  the  rents.  James 
handed  the  rents  to  Glenure  but  managed 
to  keep  a  surplus  to  support  Ardshiel's 

ife  and  family. 

Then  the  authorities  called  Glenure  to 
order,  telling  him  in  effect  that  he  had 
been  too  lax  and  was  letting  Jacobite 
families  take  over  the  farms.  Glenure 
sked  James  to  move  from  his  farm  at 
Glenduror  to  Acharn  (which  James  re- 
sented) and  then,  early  in  1752,  iierved 
notice  on  several  families  in  the  Appin 

strict.  They  were  to  be  evicted  if  they 
had  not  moved  by  Whitsuntide.  James 
took  up  their  cause  and  tried  unsuccess- 
fully before  the  Edinburgh  courts  to  have 
the  eviction  orders  suspended. 


ALAN    BRECK'S    VISIT 

At  the  beginning  of  May  it  was  learned 

at  Glenure  would  superintend  the  evic- 

insonMay  15.  James  forthwith  wrote  lo 

o  men  of  law,  asking  them  to  be  present 

on  May  15  to  protest  to  Glenure  on  behalf 

the  tenants.  This  is  an  important  point 

his  favour,  suggesting  that  he  wa.s  bent 

all  forms  of  legal  protest  and  not  of 

ilence.    )t  is  beyond  doubt  that  at  the 

hour  of  the   murder — between   5   and   6 

o'clock    on    May    14— he    was    working 

quietly  on  his  farm.  Generally,  in  fact,  he 

1  mild  mannered  man,  although  at  the 

trial  several  witnesses  declared  that  after 

he  had  been  moved  from  his  Glenduror 

farm    he    had    spoken    violently    against 

Glenure  when  (in  the  old  phrase)  he  was 

concerned  in  drink." 

There  were  others  about  him,  however, 

younger  and  more  headstrong.     First  of 

them  was  Alan  Breck.  then  paying  one 

f   his    clandestine   visits    from    France. 

Alan  used  to  arrive  in  his  French  clothes— 

long-bodied   blue  coat,  red  waistcoat, 

black  breeches  and  tartan  hose,  and  a  hat 

th  a   black   feather.     These   he  would 

change   for   any   clothes   that    he   couia 


town,  and,  on  bemg  told  that  Glenure 
was  killed,  asked  her  to  tell  a  Donald 
Stewart  to  get  money  for  him  from  James 
of  the  Glen.  Donald  Stewart  then  went 
up  the  brae  to  meet  Alan,  who  told  him 
to  tell  James  that  he  would  wait  for  the 
money  at  Coalisnacoan.  by  the  side  of 
Loch  Leven.  Donald  Stewart  duly  saw 
James  the  next  day  and  James  arranged 
for  the  money  lo  be  sent. 

All  this  was  used  against  James  at  the 
trial ;  but  if  James  had  had  foreknowledge 
of  the  murder,  and  had  promised  to  help 
in  Alan's  escape,  he  would  surely  have 
arranged  the  money  beforehand,  not  leav- 
ing it  to  be  arranged  in  haste  afterwards. 
James  sent  the  money  because  Alan 
Breck  was  a  kinsman,  a  former  deserter 
from  the  Hanoverian  forces,  and  a  maa 


Alan  was  soon  safely  in  France. 

WITNESSES'   VAGUENESS 

The  case  against  Alan  is  black  and,  were 
it  not  for  the  strong  local  tradition  that  he 
did  not  actually  fire  the  shot,  it  might  be 
taken  as  conclusive.  If  not  he,  who  then  ? 
Trying  to  sift  the  evidence  at  the  trial  (well 
set  out  in  the  Nniahle  Scottish  Trials  series, 
published  by  Hodge)  is  fantastically  diffi- 
cult, for  most  of  the  many  witnesses  had 
all  the  old  Highland  vagueness  about  time, 
and  throughout  the  critical  days  everyone 
seemed  to  be  visiting  everyone  else.  The 
young  people  especially  were  here,  there, 
and  everywhere. 

Anyone  reading  the  records  would  be 
glad  to  know  more  about  the  movements 
of  a  certain  Ewan  Roy  MacColl,  who 
came  to  Acharn  from  Glencoe  (presum- 
ably past  Lettermore)  on  the  day  of  the 
murder.  A  greater  question  is  whether 
Alan  Breck — always  impulsive,  "  a 
desperate  foolish  fellow,"  as  James  called 
him — was  suddenly  persuaded  to  take  a 
part  in  the  murder  by  one  of  the  young 
Stewarts  at  Ballachulish  House  ?  One 
of  the  strongest  local  traditions  is  that 
the  shot  was  fired  by  Donald  Stewart, 
the  nephew  of  Stewart  of  Ballachulish, 
in  league  with  John  Stewart  of  Fasna- 
cloich,  leaving  Alan  Breck  to  draw  the 
pursuit  away  from  the  others.  Other 
inquirers,  again,  would  like  to  know 
more  about  the  movements  of  James's 
own  son,  Alan  Beg  (Little  Alan). 
Alan  Beg  had  a  black  jacket  very 
like  the  one  Alan  Breck  was  wearing.  On 
the  afternoon  of  the  murder  Alan  Beg 
went  alone  from  Acharn,  according  to 
his  own  evidence,  to  the  hill  called 
Fraochaidh — which  is  about  as  far  from 
Acharn  as  Lettermore  is.  Earlier  in 
the  vear,  about  April  1,  he  wrote 
a  letter  to  Duncan  Stewart  of  Glen- 
buckie  complaining  of  Glenure's  actions, 
and  adding:  "However,  it  shall  be 
a  dear  glen  for  them  or  (before) 
they  shall  have  it."  Further,  it  is 
said  that  Alan  Breck,  when  in  France, 
declared  that  it  was  Alan  Beg  who  com- 
mitted the  murder. 

No  son  surely  would  let  his  father  hang 
for  his  own  deed,  but  another  of  the 
Appin  traditions  is  that  on  the  day  of  the 
hanging  a  man  had  to  be  tied  down  by  his 
friends  to  prevent  him  from  going  to 
declare  the  truth  at  the  place  of  execu- 
The  friends  no  doubt  thought  that 
poor  James  was  doomed  in  any  case.  So 
the  mystery  remains.
