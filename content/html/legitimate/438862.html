Originally from South Africa, Hasina was born with dance in her blood, both of her parents being famous professional Ballroom dancers at the time. But the lure of the tango and the waltz soon lost its luster for her. Instead of following family tradition, she decided to study Speech and Drama, after which she moved on to take a Business Degree in Marketing Management. Since then, she has pursued a wide-ranging career in the arts and business in London, with jobs at the British Museum, Ernst and Young, Vue Entertainment and Associated British Foods. In the Hasina Belly Dance school, she has merged her skills and knowledge in order to pursue her true passion: spreading the art of belly dance. ‘My aim is not just to teach my students’, she says, ‘but to inspire them. To help them exceed their limits!’<br />

Beginner level belly dance classes @ Féminin Sacré
Dates: Thursday: 12:30 PM - 1:15 PM
Location: Féminin Sacré - Rue Philippe Le Bon 15, 1040 Etterbeek, Belgium
instructor: Gudrun:, My name is Gudrun. Mother of 4, dance teacher for 30 years and passionate about the impact of movement on happiness. Today I found the exhilaration, the lightness, the energy and the pride of being a woman. I learned that in life you have to move to be in balance. The road to get there was long and arduous. I made a lot of detours and mistakes. During a life crisis, I had the vision of a shamanic healing ritual. Following the imperative call to share this vision, my knowledge and my experience, I created my somato-spiritual coaching method: the Shandora. This method allowed me to get back on my feet after 10 months of illness following a burnout and a situation of harassment at work. I was able to return to work during a transition phase, quit my work and become self-employed in order to live my life mission: that of initiating women into the mysteries and the power of the sacred feminine.

We can say that ballet movement in classical ballet is a form of dance that requires grace and precision using movements that follow rules regarding the position of the arms, feet and body. The choreographies are based on the combination of these fundamental movements. Some movements are exercises with the aim of increasing strength and flexibility, also helping to acquire a correct posture. Then there are movements considered steps such as jumping and pirouettes that serve to enrich the dance. But the main thing is that it serves to express an idea or emotion, release energy or simply enjoy the movement itself.

You&#039;ll have plenty of opportunity to practise the moves in one of our choreographies or even try your hand at improvisation. Dive deep into the world of oriental dance and music as each course period we present you with a different style or theme. Recognising and learning oriental rhythms will help you to stay in time with the music and adds another dimension to your dance experience

You&#039;ll use more of the space with travelling steps or combinations in different directions and veil work will be introduced. By now you can also recognise different styles of oriental music and can start to add expression to your dance.

Location: Hasina Belly Dance - Gymbox Hoborn, 100 High Holborn, London WC1V 6RD, United Kingdom
Originally from South Africa, Hasina was born with dance in her blood, both of her parents being famous professional Ballroom dancers at the time. But the lure of the tango and the waltz soon lost its luster for her. Instead of following family tradition, she decided to study Speech and Drama, after which she moved on to take a Business Degree in Marketing Management. Since then, she has pursued a wide-ranging career in the arts and business in London, with jobs at the British Museum, Ernst and Young, Vue Entertainment and Associated British Foods. In the Hasina Belly Dance school, she has merged her skills and knowledge in order to pursue her true passion: spreading the art of belly dance. ‘My aim is not just to teach my students’, she says, ‘but to inspire them. To help them exceed their limits!’
