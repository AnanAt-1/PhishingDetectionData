Transactions are grouped by blocks. A block contains the list of all transactions that happened in a specific time span. To illustrate, let us assume that we work with a blockchain with block times of one minute. Then all the transactions of the last minute are grouped in a block. All the transactions happening during the next minute will be grouped in another block that will be added to the blockchain after the previous block.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll blocks are&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Echained\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;as each block points to the previous one.

Every participant holds a full copy of the data. The above chart shows a consortium of three entreprises, but the same principle applies to a public blockchain like Bitcoin, where the number of participants is much larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one participant can modify any piece of data without all the others realizing it. No one participant can submit a transaction that goes against the rules of the network (an invalid transaction). No one participant can delete data. If one node is offline, the others can still function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a traditional database, the owner of the database usually has full admin rights on it. With a blockchain, there is no single owner of the database, the ownership is shared among all the participating parties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ELedger of transactions\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike traditional databases, the blockchain does not store entries, variables and their values. It just stores transactions that update those values (this is a simplification, many blockchains have a twist around that principle). If we take the example of a payment system: The blockchain does not store the amount of money available on each specific account. If Alice has 0$ on her account and Bob transfers 3$ to Alice, we know that Alice has access to 3$ because there is a transaction saying that she received 3$. If Alice now sends 1$ to Carole, Alice has 2$ left. But nowhere in the blockchain is it said that Alice has 2$. In fact, by keeping track of the transactions, we know that she first received 3$ then spent 1$, so because each node in the network always computes all the transactions, they can all conclude that she has 2$ left. That smoothly brings us to the following paragraph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EAppend-only\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQHKUlXHG5Bpeg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1549445827527?e=1752710400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=RHleqepi7Aj6V8V-B4ye90P-f1JQB9gVisr8OQ0z7gs\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we do not modify any entry in the database per se, but we just add transactions that change the state of information, the blockchain is append-only.

Well, that is the key characteristic that prevents any party from modifying any historical data without every other parties noticing it immediately. Indeed, the least modification of data in any block changes its fingerprint. If its fingerprint is modified, the next block, that includes the previous block's fingerprint, is also modified. Therefore, same thing for the next block, and the next and the next. The chain is broken. Any modification in the past breaks the chain and as all parties hold the ledger, everybody will immediately realize that some invalid action took place. That is how we can claim that the blockchain is immutable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if all parties agree on a modification, they can proceed and change whatever they want. So modifications are very well feasible in a private blockchain / consortium environment, where agreeing between a limited number of parties is possible. In a public blockhain, it is often infeasible (fortunately) due to the large number of participants and the decentralized nature of the network. (the differences between public and private blockchain is explained below.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ETimestamped\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQGNAqPsrZ0d7A/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1549445845198?e=1752710400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=wDXSMmdHbKiwQcahKaZbckG4lajQIAGYV5Hh8EYoQKk\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery block includes a timestamp.

Two of the main cryptographic systems used in a blockchain are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EPublic-key cryptography\u003C/a\u003E: We use a combination of a public and a private digital keys. Each user has his own private key(s) that \"identifies\" him and grants him access to perform certain transactions or own/transfer certain assets (like bitcoins or tokens).\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EHashing\u003C/a\u003E: The hash of a piece of data is its digital fingerprint. It is notably used, as we saw above, to compute the digital fingerprint of a block and to guarantee the integrity of the chain.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not going into more details here as I do not want this introduction to be too technical. Feel free to click the links or to contact me for more explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EBlockchain primitives\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some specific features enabled by blockchain and that allow to imagine new use cases or to improve greatly business processes. I will mention three of them: Smart contracts, Multisignature, Tokenization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ESmart contracts\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we have access to a platform in which we can put our trust, even if we are dealing with other parties, we can envision the automation of important transactions, like, for example, automatic payments when certain conditions are met.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmart contracts are pieces of code that live on a blockchain. They represent digital agreements between parties that will be computed automatically when called by a transaction. Like any other piece of code, they are made of clauses like&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Eif...then...else\u003C/em\u003E. So based on certain conditions, they will lead to different actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they are on a blockchain and must be computed the same way by all the nodes on the network, smart contracts are deterministic and auto-enforced. That implies that there is a certainty of the contract fulfillment, the contract cannot be interpreted in different ways and its enforceability does not depend on the subjectivity of a judge; and the agreement between the parties is inseparable from its execution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine that Alice owns a car renting company. Bob wants to rent a car for two days. Alice installed an electronic key system for entering and starting the car. The smart contract between Alice and Bob says that from a specific date until 48 hours later, Bob's private key will be able to open and use the car. It also says that Bob cannot drive more than 1000km with the car, and that at the end date of the lease, the fuel tank must be full otherwise Bob will not get back his security deposit. Alice also digitally signed a smart contract with a car insurance company. The contract says that every time the car drives 1km, a micropayment is made by Alice to the car insurance company. At the start time of the lease, Bob automatically has access to the car. While Bob drives the car, the insurance company is automatically paid by kilometer. If Bob tries to drive longer than 1000km, the car stops and, based on the GPS, only accepts to drive if Bob goes to the direction of Alice's shop (so Bob and the car are not stucked in the middle of nowhere 😠). Bob goes back to the shop and fills the fuel tank before giving the car back to Alice. Alice digitally signs that she received the car back and in good condition. The security deposit, which was held in an escrow account on the blockchain, is automatically transfered to Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA blockchain, a few smart contracts, a few connected trackers/devices in the car were all what was needed to enable a smooth renting experience, without any payment delay or room for conflict. I know, I am exaggerating a bit 🤷‍, but you get the idea. Now imagine the infinite number of cases where smart contracts could be applied...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EMultisignature\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultisignature is the concept to require more than one key to authorize a transaction. It is allowed by a combination of cryptography and smart contracts. It allows implementing schemes like 2-of-3 signatures, or 3-of-5, or any other scheme you want. In a 2-of-3 multisignature scheme, 2 of 3 specific users/entities must sign a transaction to send it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine that you are the CEO of a large corporation. You want to empower your divisions vice-presidents and your CFO. For the purpose of spending a division's budget, so in order to be able to make financial transactions, you implement a 2-of-3 signatures scheme. The CEO, the CFO, the VP each have one of the 3 valid keys. In a 2-of-3, if the VP needs to spend money, he can go to the CFO, and if they both agree on the spending, they are enough to sign the transaction. If anyone of the CFO and the VP disagrees, they will not be able to spend without consulting the CEO and getting is approval (via his digital signature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultisignature, together with the flexibility of smart contracts, allow to imagine very powerful schemes and methods of governance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003ETokenization\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Satoshi Nakamoto has invented with Bitcoin (and blockchain) is the scarcity of a digital object. Prior to Bitcoin, no digital object could be scarce, limited in supply. When you sent a digital object, like a picture, an e-mail or a music file, you were sending a copy of that file. Any digital piece of data could be copied as many times as wanted. When you sent a file to someone, you could not prove that you transfered that file and you did not keep it. Bitcoin was the first digital thing that could be provably transfered, provably owned, and could not be copied at will. Such feat is possible thanks to the distributed blockchain ledger, the cryptography, the consensus algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA blockchain token is a digital object that lives on a blockchain. Like a bitcoin, a token on a blockchain can be provably transfered and owned. If they live on a blockchain, they can be used in combination with smart contracts and, again, that opens up many possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETokens can be something of their own, like bitcoin or other crypto-currencies, utility tokens, collectible tokens like&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://www.cryptokitties.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ECryptoKitties\u003C/a\u003E,... They do not represent something else, they are the thing. They can be used as money, as collectibles, as keys, as tickets,...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr tokens can be the representation of other assets, other objects (digital or physical). A good example is a house. The ownership of a house could be tokenized. It would therefore be much easier to buy, sell, transfer the ownership of a house, or even, why not, of a portion of the house.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just a glimpse of what tokenization means. As always, now let your imagination run and drop the limits of the past 🤯.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EPublic and Private blockchains\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two main kinds of blockchains: Public (permissionless) blockchains and private (permissioned) blockchains. Both are based on the same data structure (chain of blocks) but they are very different in their security model and their use cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EPublic (permissionless) blockchains\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a public blockchain, anybody can launch a node, join the network and start making transactions. No permission is required to participate. The most well known permissionless blockchain is Bitcoin. Ethereum is another example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs anybody can participate and run a node, there is a need for a mechanism to control how new blocks are added to the chain and by who. For that purpose, the most secure blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum use&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003Eproof of work\u003C/a\u003E. Nodes must burn energy (by having many computers solve a super hard mathematical puzzle) in order to append new blocks. That prevents an adversarial party to tamper with the ledger because it has to compete with an already enourmous amount of running computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPublic blockchains are uncensorable. Even if one or multiple governments wanted to stop, modify, censor, attack the Bitcoin blockchain, they could not efficiently circumvent its proof of work (I invite you to check out a small article I wrote about&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-governments-could-attack-bitcoin-so-think-jonathan-gross/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EHow Governments Could Attack Bitcoin\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EPrivate (permissioned) blockchains\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a private blockchain, only a limited set of participants can run a node and join the network. The node must be in the list of permissioned participants. An important use case is for collaborations between entreprises or within a consortium of entreprises (there are many other use cases, some of which I will probably study in following articles). If multiple entreprises do not have aligned interests or do not fully trust each others (they could be competitors) but collaborate on a project or have to regularly transact among each other, a private blockchain is a good option to automate business processes between them. Indeed, with a private blockchain, no one company is the owner or admin of the database. All participants can trust the ledger and the smart contracts running on them. The blockchain will be a good replacement for the countless emails, pdfs, phone calls 😲, physical pieces of paper 😲😲, manual signatures, manual money transfers between those companies because of the lack of IT system integration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsensus mechanisms within private/consortium blockchains are very different from public blockchains. They are not based around the consumption of energy but use other types of consensus algorithms, like, for example, voting-based algorithms. Indeed, we know the participants and how many they are (list of permissioned nodes). Therefore there is no need to protect against attackers or dishonest participants launching many nodes to screw up the voting (what we call a&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ESybil attack\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;on the network).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike public blockchains, private blockchains are not uncensorable. They are run by a limited number of participants, often entreprises, and if those all agree on a modification, they can proceed with it. If they are forced by the authorities to amend the ledger, they will most likely comply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch3\u003EPublic vs Private\u003C/h3\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the above, we can conclude that (large) public/permissionless blockchains are the ideal vehicles for exchanging value or tokenized valuable assets. They are also preferred over private blockchains for supporting smart contracts between entities that cannot be confined in a limited list (anybody can participate). On the other hand, private/permissioned blockchains are very useful for integrating processes between business entities and for securing and recording important data and transactions among them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EClosing words\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI'll stop there in order to avoid overwhelming you with new information (if it's not already done).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you learnt stuff. I hope you are now better equipped to understand what this is about and how you can use this technology. One thing I'll add is that, although I am convinced and I try to convince you that blockchains will disrupt the world and many business processes, blockchain is not adequate for everything. There are many cases where a traditional database does the job perfectly well, especially for internal processes within a single entity, where there is no trust issue. Do not believe those who surf on the hype and want to use and implement blockchain everywhere.

That could convince some governments to launch attacks on the Bitcoin network to try to interrupt or disable it. Bitcoin has demonstrated its resilience against many attacks already and we will now have a look at some ways governments could try to disable it and how Bitcoin will defend itself (We are choosing Bitcoin instead of \"a public chain\" for making the argumentation clearer.)\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E \n   \u003Cimg data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQFiFZMZ7nWw1A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1549022596865?e=1752710400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Pw8NykLwYQLiotcGYAQnEnuRJxJZwjz_45j9aQ0-xZo\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E \n  \u003C/div\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EThe most probable attacks from governments against Bitcoin would be based on regulation. We divide those attacks into three categories: forbid the underlying cryptocurrency, forbid companies providing services related to Bitcoin, forbid the installation and use of nodes and wallets. Firstly, a government could forbid the exchange and use of a cryptocurrency. If nobody were to trust or use that cryptocurrency anymore, that would remove the incentive to maintain the blockchain and that blockchain will stop being supported. But by making it illegal to use a cryptocurrency would not stop its use. It is illegal to transact in US dollars in Venezuela but that does not prevent the dollar to be the most used currency there. Secondly, the government can forbid companies to provide Bitcoin services. But there is a vibrant community of developers who write opensource code and services and find other incentives than profit and salaries to develop services. Lastly forbidding the installation and use of nodes would not efficiently prevent anybody to download and use them, as shown by the example of piracy in the music industry. It is also important to note that if only one or a few governments would impose restrictive regulation on Bitcoin, it would still be easily used in other countries and that would create regulation arbitrage and potential emigration. And those restrictive regulations would also undermine the innovation and future economy in that country if we consider that blockchain technologies will be an important part of the economy in the future.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EOne or multiple governments could stop net neutrality, limit internet access and/or block certain IP addresses based on their involvement in the blockchain network. The response from the users of the network will be to use IP obfuscation tools like VPNs, TOR or I2P.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EAnother attack from governments could be social attacks like misinformation. Those attacks have been happening for many years now, associating in the mainstream media Bitcoin to criminal activities. They might have had some negative impact, but those impacts are only temporary as more and more people understand now that criminal activity is only a small part of what Bitcoin allows and will allow in the future.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EThe last attacks we will consider are 51% attacks and quantum attacks. Let us start with 51% attacks with classical computers. The attacking government would need to gather an enormous amount of computing resources to be able to launch such an attack. And while attacking, it will need to spend an enourmous amount of energy. If it can succeed in mining around six blocks in a row, it could make some big double spends. But those double spends will not greatly undermine the confidence in the network. To significantly undermine that confidence, it would need to rewrite history and be able to calculate the POW of many blocks. The amount of resources required for that is so huge that it is considered impossible for any single party, even with large financial resources. This would be different with quantum computers. Quantum computers could have a certain advantage with the current POW algorithm, but it has been estimated that those computers will not be ready to take advantage of that before 2040 (\u003Ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EQuantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them\u003C/a\u003E), and it would be possible to modify the POW algorithm to limit that advantage. The main threat from quantum computers, however, is the attacks on the private/public key cryptography used in Bitcoin (see previous link). The threat could arrive in around 7 years, but there are countermeasures being worked on and explained in the referenced article.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E \n   \u003Cimg data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQHpUWt22YYAFw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1549022675800?e=1752710400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=RBwVobTXcX6x4pzSBa7vFFQKH_SOE_XtgfN0loX1oPs\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E \n  \u003C/div\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EThe risk is not zero that any of those attacks, or new ones, can have significant negative impacts on Bitcoin, but Bitcoin has shown and strengthened its resilience with every previous attacks.

As the sale of a property concerns many different parties, we identified multiple areas where the implementation of a blockchain would make sense and improve the collaborations and processes. Two blockchain implementations were selected for further study, and one of them led to a prototype. They are briefly explained below.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Ch3\u003EA ledger of all lands and properties in Belgium\u003C/h3\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EThere are so many important documents and information regarding real estate properties that are really important but none of them is kept at the same place.

This was very difficult to consider prior to blockchain technologies because of the many different involved parties and sources of information. No single entity should be owner and responsible for all this sensitive information. A blockchain is the perfect tool to support such a gathering of data and a decentralization of the trust and the responsibilities.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Ch3\u003EAs-built\u003C/h3\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EFrom the first blueprint of the building to the painting of the last room, there usually are many modifications that are not always perfectly tracked. What we call the as-built blueprint is the blueprint delivered at the end of the construction, and that includes the initial blueprint plus all the modifications. The as-built should serve as a good representation of the final state of the building. Often it is not. Communication between the real estate developer, the architect, the building supervisor, the construction workers, and all the other parties that are involved in the building phase, is not always perfect. Each party has his interests, priorities, and more often than not, their interests are not aligned. That communication usually happens over the phone or over emails. It is difficult to track the discussions, the documents, the decisions.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EA digital platform to support all communications regarding the construction of a building would quickly prove benefitial. The problem is that when the actors are big companies, they usually do not want to rely entirely on a system administered by one of their counterparts, and specially for such sensitive information. Again, that is where a blockchain fits the bill. There is no single admin of the system and no actor can cheat the others.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cdiv class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"\u003E \n   \u003Cimg data-media-urn=\"\" data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQFjUwtA5KHzuQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1548866803000?e=1752710400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=i7CxdfpNVr3g1X30i55fVWyAPsnlRGUL226oGb7oMig\" src=\"//:0\"\u003E \n  \u003C/div\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EAfter a&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003EValue Proposition Design\u003C/em\u003E&nbsp;exercise, it was decided to develop an MVP of a private blockchain to demonstrate this use case.

Je ne serais pas étonné qu’une bonne partie de ceux qui l’ont en effet lu ou entendu associent ce mot exclusivement à l’achat d’armes ou de drogue, à de jeunes geeks qui sont récemment devenus riches en spéculant sur le cours de change entre le dollar et le bitcoin (les “bitcoin millionaires”) ou bien à un “truc” de geeks qui ne savent plus quoi inventer. Bien que tout cela existe bel et bien, le Bitcoin c’est bien plus que cela. Le Bitcoin, c’est aussi une méthode de paiement déjà acceptée par plus de 15.000 sites d’e-commerce et d’ONG aux États-Unis, c’est la monnaie choisie par de plus en plus d’américains pour recevoir leurs salaires, ce sont des centaines de startups spécialisées créées en 2013, c’est un premier distributeur automatique installé en Europe (à Helsinki, mais d’autres sont en attente de livraison dans les plus grandes villes), ce sont plus de 11 millions d’utilisateurs à travers le monde et c’est aussi depuis tout récemment un moyen de paiement accepté par notre opérateur de téléphonie Mobile Vikings. Mais bien que tout cela existe bel et bien, le Bitcoin ça pourrait être encore bien plus que cela. Les plus idéalistes et optimistes de ses utilisateurs pensent qu’on assiste à une révolution, non seulement technologique mais aussi sociétale. Malgré qu’on parle beaucoup du bitcoin dans les media, je rencontre beaucoup de gens qui ne comprennent pas de quoi il s’agit vraiment ou qui sous-estiment son champ d’action. Je me propose donc ici de vous expliquer le plus simplement possible de quoi il s’agit, d’aborder quelques enjeux importants, de déconstruire certains aprioris. J’espère surtout vous encourager à vous intéresser davantage à ce vaste sujet et vous donner les clés pour décrypter ce que vous lirez dorénavant.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ELe Bitcoin prend son origine dans le constat que les États tirent une grosse partie de leur pouvoir dans leur contrôle de l’infrastructure financière. Les&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003Ecypherpunks\u003C/a\u003E, des activistes qui prônent l’utilisation de la cryptographie pour améliorer la société, réfléchissent depuis 25 ans à des moyens basés sur la cryptographie pour créer une monnaie digitale décentralisée et ainsi rétablir la liberté d’interaction économique. Mais deux problèmes fondamentaux se sont présentés à tous ceux qui ont tenté de créer une telle monnaie.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ELe premier problème est le registre de la liste des transactions. En effet, quand, dans le système actuel, on reçoit un virement bancaire, c’est en fait une banque qui confirme que le payeur avait sur son compte l’argent nécessaire à la transaction et qui confirme que cet argent appartient dorénavant au payé. Qu’une liste des transactions soit conservée est indispensable à toute utilisation d’argent virtuel. Mais donner la responsabilité de conserver cette liste de transactions à quiconque ou quelconque entité nous éloigne de l’objectif de décentralisation. La solution proposée par le Bitcoin est tout simplement que tout le monde conserve la liste complète de toutes les transactions effectuées depuis la création de celui-ci. En fait, tous les ordinateurs connectés au réseau et faisant tourner le logiciel officiel du Bitcoin ont ce registre sur leur ordinateur. Et ce registre, qu’on appelle la&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Eblockchain\u003C/em\u003E, se met à jour à chaque connexion. Plus besoin de faire confiance à une centrale.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ELe deuxième problème fondamental est la “double dépense”, ou comment empêcher Pierre d’envoyer 1€ à Paul et 1€ à Jacques alors qu’il n’a qu’1€ sur son compte. Il est évident qu’une partie du problème est résolu parce que tous les utilisateurs ont accès à la&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Eblockchain\u003C/em\u003E. Quand Jacques reçoit son paiement, son ordinateur va interroger les autres ordinateurs du réseau et il va pouvoir confirmer qu’après avoir envoyé 1€ à Paul, Pierre n’a plus d’argent sur son compte. Mais que se passerait-il si Pierre a l’intelligence — et les compétences techniques — d’effectuer les deux paiements presque simultanément ? Les ordinateurs du réseau que l’ordinateur de Jacques va interroger pour savoir si Pierre à encore 1€ à dépenser n’auront peut-être pas encore reçu l’information du paiement fait à Paul. Le Bitcoin propose une solution élégante basée sur la cryptographie, dans laquelle les ordinateurs connectés au réseau vont se mettre en commun et faire des calculs pour vérifier la transaction et après 10 minutes, Jacques aura la confirmation ou l’infirmation de la légitimité de sa transaction. Pour être plus exact, ce n’est qu’après 60 minutes que la transaction sera totalement confirmée comme exempte d’irrégularités, mais on n’attend généralement autant de temps que pour les très grosses transactions. J’aimerais pouvoir vous expliquer comment cela marche techniquement, mais je n’en ai pas la place ici. Peut-être dans un prochain article.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ELe bitcoin est la première monnaie décentralisée digitale qui a proposé une solution solide à ces 2 problèmes. Et plus généralement, c’est le premier réseau de communication peer-to-peer (pair-à-pair, c-à-d. qu’il n’y a pas un serveur central, mais le réseau est constitué de tous les ordinateurs qui y sont connectés) qui a trouvé réponse à la question “Comment avoir un système décentralisé sans pour autant faire confiance à aucune des parties ?”. Ceci m’amène à un point fondamental mais trop souvent méconnu ; le système formulé par l’inventeur du Bitcoin décrit un&nbsp;protocole&nbsp;de communication vérifiée — protocole que l’on nomme le Bitcoin, avec un “B majuscule” — et sur lequel se base une&nbsp;monnaie — le bitcoin avec un “petit b”. Il est très important de faire la part des choses entre le Bitcoin — le protocole — et le bitcoin (BTC) — la monnaie. La monnaie est celle dont vous entendez souvent parler. Le protocole permet de supporter la monnaie, mais en tant que protocole de communication vérifiée décentralisé, il permet en fait bien plus que le simple support d’une monnaie. J’y reviens plus bas dans un autre paragraphe.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EDe par sa nature, le bitcoin a des avantages évidents pour les utilisateurs que nous sommes comparé aux monnaies centralisées comme l’euro, le dollar, le yuan,… Les transactions, même internationales, en bitcoins sont quasi immédiates, sans frais (ou presque, mais je ne m’y attarderai pas ici), sans intermédiaire. Ce n’est donc pas étonnant qu’il intéresse autant. Et pourtant, bien que ces avantages soient effectivement réels pour nous, habitants de pays riches ; c’est dans d’autres contrées qu’il pourrait avoir un réel impact économique. Avant d’y revenir, j’aimerais discuter de deux caractéristiques importantes du bitcoin.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ELe bitcoin est une monnaie déflationniste. Par opposition à la possibilité qu’ont les banques centrales d’imprimer des billets selon leur bon vouloir, le bitcoin a été créé de telle manière que le nombre de bitcoins croît selon une courbe déterministe. Toutes les 10 minutes, un nombre fixe de bitcoins sont générés. Entre 2009 et 2013, ce nombre était de 50. Puis, tous les 4 ans ce nombre sera divisé par 2, pour atteindre 0.00000001 bitcoins générés toutes les 10 minutes en 2140. Aucune institution n’a ou n’aura le pouvoir d’en créer plus ou moins. Il y a actuellement 12 millions de bitcoins en circulation ; et nous savons qu’il y en aura 21 millions au total en 2140, date à partir de laquelle aucun bitcoin ne sera plus généré. Cela a pour conséquence importante que si l’utilisation du bitcoin se généralise, la valeur d’1 BTC pourrait augmenter significativement pour permettre de supporter cette utilisation, d’autant plus que le bitcoin est divisible jusqu’à la 8ème décimale. De fait, on parle déjà beaucoup en millibitcoin (mBTC) plutôt qu’en bitcoin. Pour se faire une idée, au moment où j’écris ces lignes, il y a pour 9 milliards de dollars de bitcoins en circulation (12 millions de BTC x 750$/BTC). Le total de dollars en circulation est quant à lui de 1.230 milliards. Ce nombre limité de bitcoins est une des raisons qui expliquent la forte augmentation récente de la valeur du bitcoin. Ça implique malheureusement aussi qu’il y a un certain intérêt à épargner en bitcoins, et donc son utilisation comme moyen d’échange pourrait en être détériorée.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EL’autre caractéristique intéressante est la question de l’anonymat. Pour évoquer cela, je vais d’abord brièvement expliquer comment on échange des bitcoins. Le logiciel (ou service en ligne) que vous choisissez d’utiliser pour recevoir et envoyer vos bitcoins vous génère une ou des paires de clés. Une clé est une chaîne de caractères qui va permettre de chiffrer ou déchiffrer un message. Une paire de clés est constituée d’une clé publique et d’une clé privée. La clé publique sera utilisée pour chiffrer un message que seule la clé privée associée pourra déchiffrer (voir la “\u003Ca href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographie_asym%C3%A9trique\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003Ecryptographie asymétrique\u003C/a\u003E”). En pratique, quand vous voulez recevoir un paiement en bitcoin, il vous suffit d’envoyer votre clé publique au payeur, clé qu’on appellera dès lors votre “adresse” (vous pouvez la communiquer librement, comme vous le feriez avec votre numéro de compte). À l’aide de son logiciel, le payeur va envoyer des bitcoins à votre adresse. À partir de ce moment, tout le réseau saura que les bitcoins envoyés “appartiennent” à cette adresse, mais seul vous, qui connaissez la clé privée correspondante, pourrez faire usage de ces bitcoins. Comme ces clés ne sont pas liées à un nom ou à une quelconque identité (elles sont générées aléatoirement par votre logiciel), l’envoi et la réception de bitcoins sont théoriquement anonymes. Mais comme la liste des transactions est totalement transparente, il a été démontré que dans beaucoup de cas, en suivant le trajet de bitcoins d’adresses en adresses, il est souvent possible de remonter à une personne. Cela au grand dam des gros utilisateurs du site de vente de drogue et armes en ligne “The Silk Road”, qui croyaient qu’ils achetaient de manière anonyme. Mais des startups sont déjà en train d’imaginer des services qui permettent de rendre des transactions anonymes en utilisant des techniques de division et mixage de celles-ci. Donc sans rentrer ici dans le débat de savoir si il serait préférable que l’utilisation du bitcoin soit anonyme ou pas ; ce qu’il faut retenir c’est que théoriquement le système est anonyme, dans les faits, en utilisation normale, il ne l’est pas, mais en prenant certaines précautions et en utilisant des services spécifiques, il peut l’être.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EExaminons maintenant des applications réelles de l’utilisation du bitcoin. Et tant qu’à faire, attardons-nous sur celles qui ont un véritable impact économique sur ceux qui en ont le plus besoin. Les premiers qui ont beaucoup à tirer de la généralisation du bitcoin sont les immigrants économiques qui envoient de l’argent à leur famille restée au pays. Le total de ces transferts représente une somme d’argent colossale. Les options proposées pour effectuer ces transferts sont limitées et, actuellement, les plus généralisées sont Western Union et MoneyGram. Ces opérateurs sont choisis parce que leurs frais de transaction sont moins chers que les banques pour ce type de transferts internationaux. Il n’empêche que pour envoyer de l’argent des pays développés vers les pays plus pauvres d’Afrique, d’Amérique Latine ou d’Asie, les frais sont en moyenne de 12.5%, et peuvent être bien plus élevés dans certains cas, parfois jusqu’à 20, 30 ou même 40% pour les petits transferts. Un impôt ponctionné par le système financier occidental et qui enlève aux plus démunis toute chance de développement économique. Le bitcoin pourrait faire descendre ces frais à des pourcentages proches de 0. Et pour pallier à la fracture numérique, des services ciblés pour les pays en développement sont déjà en train d’être créés pour permettre de faire des transferts de bitcoins avec un simple téléphone. Et pour le change de bitcoins en monnaie locale, de nombreux commerçants locaux sont en train d’être formés et équipés.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ESi vous êtes vénézuélien, une de vos grosses préoccupations actuelles est d’essayer de changer vos bolivars en dollars américains. Le pouvoir y imprime de la monnaie dans un rythme effréné et l’inflation y atteint ainsi des records. Pour ne pas voir votre épargne fondre comme neige au soleil, il s’agit de la convertir dans une monnaie plus stable. Mais le gouvernement, tentant d’empêcher cette conversion de masse (souvent vers le dollar), met en place des moyens légaux et pratiques pour la limiter, si pas l’interdire. C’est pour cela que beaucoup de vénézuéliens se rabattent déjà sur le bitcoin, qui échappe à ces limitations et dans lequel ils voient une monnaie qui fera fructifier leur épargne plutôt que la déprécier.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EDans un article intitulé “\u003Ca href=\"http://rt.com/op-edge/palestine-switch-to-bitcoin-558/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EShould Palestine switch from the shekel to bitcoin?\u003C/a\u003E”, un commentateur financier ancien agent de change, Max Keiser, fait la proposition aux palestiniens d’utiliser le bitcoin plutôt que le shekel israëlien,\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cblockquote\u003E\n    “guidé par une politique de taux d’intérêt fixé mensuellement par la Banque d’Israël, qui dicte les finances palestiniennes.” \n  \u003C/blockquote\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EIl rajoute que\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cblockquote\u003E\n    “pour la première fois dans l’histoire, un pays émergent comme la Palestine a la capacité de se séparer de son occupant en adoptant une monnaie cryptographique : le bitcoin. Pas un coup doit être tiré. Aucun vote de l’ONU n’est nécessaire. Pas de négociation internationale de paix. Juste le bitcoin pour la victoire.” \n  \u003C/blockquote\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003Eet que\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cblockquote\u003E\n    “l’argent pourrait être envoyé en et hors de Palestine sans être inquiété par les banquiers internationaux qui ont conspiré avec Israël pour maintenir les Palestiniens derrière le mur d’apartheid d’Israël, à la fois physique et monétaire.” \n  \u003C/blockquote\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EIl va de soi qu’au vu de la segmentation géographique mise en place par Israël dans les territoires palestiniens, la fin de l’occupation nécessitera plus qu’un changement de monnaie. Mais on comprend mieux avec ces quelques exemples comment cette monnaie numérique, souvent vue simplement comme un délire de geeks, est, de par son caractère décentralisé, un moyen d’émancipation économique et politique.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EIci nous parlions bien du bitcoin en tant que monnaie. Comme je le mentionnais plus haut, le Bitcoin (avec un B majuscule) est un protocole de communication qui permet bien plus que de simplement servir de support à cette monnaie. Les aspects de transparence de l’information (le caractère publique de la&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003Eblockchain\u003C/em\u003E), de protection contre les fraudes et le fait qu’à chaque transaction peut être joint n’importe quel texte ou document encouragent en effet certains à imaginer l’utilisation de ce protocole pour signer des contrats, pour des transferts de propriétés, pour la vente de parts de sociétés, même l’échange de marchandises,… (voir par exemple les projets&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://www.mastercoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EMastercoin\u003C/a\u003E&nbsp;et&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"http://coloredcoins.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EColored Coins\u003C/a\u003E). C’est pour cela que le concept est reconnu par beaucoup comme révolutionnaire. Il s’agit tout simplement de se passer d’intermédiaire. Et dans les exemples cités, ce sont souvent des intermédiaires à caractère monopolistique : les États, les grandes banques, les principaux organismes de paiement, les bourses, les notaires,… Il est clair que le chemin pour arriver à une utilisation généralisée du Bitcoin pour ce type d’applications est semé de nombreuses embûches légales, politiques, institutionnelles, psychologiques. Ce n’est pas sans effort qu’on bousculera le système établi, système dans lequel les intermédiaires dont nous parlons de nous passer ont évidemment une situation actuelle confortable et influente, et auraient tout à perdre. À moins qu’ils n’emboîtent le pas de la modernité en repensant leur utilité, leurs business models autour de ces nouveaux outils pour fournir des services qui apportent une valeur ajoutée à leurs clients plutôt que de profiter de leurs situations établies et privilèges monopolistiques. Parce que bien que des États et institutions soient déjà parties en guerre contre le développement du bitcoin, comme la Chine ou l’Inde, beaucoup d’autres ont compris que parce qu’il est de nature décentralisée et basée sur le peer-to-peer, il ne saurait être interdit. Tout au plus, son utilisation et son change peuvent être rendus plus compliqués. La plupart des pays se sont lancés récemment dans des réflexions sur leur réaction par rapport au bitcoin et sur sa compatibilité avec leurs lois financières en vigueur. Nombre d’entre eux ont déjà déclaré que le bitcoin n’était pas illégal et qu’ils n’interféreraient pas avec celui-ci. Mais ils réfléchissent bien entendu à légiférer et ont commencé à officialiser le fait que les revenus générés par ou avec le bitcoin seront soumis à taxation comme tout autre revenu. À suivre…\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EAvant de conclure cette introduction sur le B/bitcoin, je voudrais rapidement passer en revue certains des aprioris qui reviennent souvent à son sujet. D’abord, on reproche au bitcoin son rôle central dans le darkweb, comme monnaie d’échange pour acheter de la drogue ou des armes. En effet, on peut acheter de la drogue avec des bitcoins. En terme de valeur, la drogue est globalement le 2ème type de marchandise le plus acheté, après la nourriture. Il serait donc assez étonnant (voire décevant ?), que le bitcoin, dont beaucoup essaient de démontrer l’efficacité en tant que monnaie, ne permette pas d’en acheter. Le système actuel, fort de ses monnaies centralisées, n’a pas démontré, d’après moi, un succès convaincant dans la limitation de l’achat de drogue. Le marché noir a toujours existé et existera toujours.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EBeaucoup d’utilisateurs sont aussi freinés dans l’achat de bitcoins sous prétexte qu’ils ont peur d’investir dans quelque chose qui n’aurait pas de valeur intrinsèque, comme en aurait par exemple l’or. Mais qu’est-ce qu’une valeur intrinsèque ? Les “choses” ont la valeur qu’on leur donne, en fonction de l’intérêt qu’on leur porte. Avant qu’on ne découvre les vertus de l’or, il ne valait guère plus que le sable. L’or a acquis sa valeur quand on a découvert ses différentes applications et les limites de son approvisionnement. Cela est pareil pour le bitcoin, qui possède de la valeur dans la facilité, la rapidité et la sécurité de son échange, et dans la liste publique de toute ses transactions. Et si on s’inquiète de ce qui est parfois considéré comme une pyramide de Ponzi, c’est-à-dire de geeks qui sont devenus millionnaires parce qu’ils ont généré et acheté très peu cher des bitcoins qui ont pris énormément de valeur en quelques années, comprenons qu’il s’agit juste de personnes qui ont cru et investi dans quelque chose qui n’avait au départ aucune valeur aux yeux de la plupart et qui en a prise de manière très importante grâce à leur travail de développement et de persuasion.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EIl y a aussi la peur qu’une autre monnaie cryptographique soit créée du jour au lendemain par un développeur et qu’elle soit plus efficace que le bitcoin et donc prenne sa place. En réalité, beaucoup d’autres monnaies cryptographiques ont déjà été créées depuis l’émergence du bitcoin il y a 4 ans. Toutes ces monnaies sont basées sur les mêmes principes que le bitcoin tout en apportant des différences légères. Certaines, comme par exemple le&nbsp;\u003Cem\u003ELitecoin\u003C/em\u003E, acquèrent une valeur certaine et commencent aussi à être utilisées comme monnaie d’échange. Il n’empêche que, au vu de sa valeur actuelle, le bitcoin a une longueur d’avance et garde pour l’instant la confiance de la plupart de ses utilisateurs. Mais, rien n’empêche que plusieurs monnaies de ce type se généralisent et soient utilisées en parallèle. De plus, personne ne peut soutenir avec certitude que le bitcoin restera éternellement la monnaie cryptographique de référence. C’est plutôt le concept en lui-même que soutiennent les supporters du bitcoin. Ils pensent qu’il a le potentiel de se faire une place dans notre futur, peu importe quel sera son nom dans 10 ans.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003ETous ces éléments ont malgré tout la facheuse conséquence de rendre la valeur du bitcoin très volatile. C’est un réel problème, qui freine sa généralisation. Conserver des bitcoins est assez risqué et proposer le bitcoin comme moyen de paiement implique pour le moment de changer ses prix plusieurs fois par jour. Il s’agit d’un problème de jeunesse, qui ne se résoudra qu’avec une plus grande connaissance du public sur le sujet, de laquelle découlera une plus grande confiance et une généralisation de son utilisation.\u003C/p\u003E \n  \u003Cp\u003EPour conclure, j’espère que, si vous n’étiez pas très informé sur le sujet, je vous ai éclairci sur celui-ci, et peut-être même donné envie de vous y intéresser davantage. L’intérêt général pour le bitcoin, son développement et son utilisation sont en plein boom.
