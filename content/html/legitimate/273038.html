It is not an exclusive list, but I have tried to select the features that I believe are the most interesting / useful. There is a small amount of commom material with the original Advanced Diagnostics presentation, mainly to give context, but the majority of the features covered are new. The presentation was given at the UKOUG Conference in December 2014. The presentation was developed against Oracle 11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1 and 12.1.0.2

The presentation provides a basic introduction to memory structures. It examines the buffer cache and how Global Cache Services (GCS) maintains buffer cache consistency across multiple instances. It then examines the library cache and how Global Enqueue Services (GES) maintains locks across multiple instances. It was presented at the Hotsos Symposium 2006 in Dallas Tex
as. A version was also presented as a webcast for the International RAC SIG in April 2006.
