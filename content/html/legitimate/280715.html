<h1>Bibulus</h1>
<h2>- a bibliography processing system</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Ever heard of BibTeX?  It's a great tool for extracting entries
from a database of bibliographic information and formatting them
in various ways depending of your document.
<p>
Unfortunately, BibTeX is very old (from the mid-eighties), and
although various auxiliary packages have been written, there
still are many things that you cannot do, or only with difficulty.
For instance, character sets other than plain ASCII cause problems
with sorting, it is closely tied to LaTeX, and if you want to change
the way the bibliography is formatted, you have to write a style file
in the rather obscure BibTeX stack language.

<h3>Enters Bibulus</h3>
<p>
Bibulus is a complete rewrite, written in pure Perl.
<p>
Bibliographies are stored in XML, which means that there are plenty of
editors you can use for editing your bibliographic databases, and you
can easily convert them to other formats and exchange them with
others.  Bibulus includes a program that will convert your old BibTeX
databases to XML.
<p>
Bibulus is truly multilingual.  It uses Unicode internally, but it can
both read and write other character sets.
<p>
To Bibulus, LaTeX is just yet another input/output format.  If you
want, you can also get your bibliography in pure ASCII or in HTML,
and other formats will be added with time.
<p>
If you're using LaTeX, you can define the style within the LaTeX file.
  For instance, while \bibliographystyle{plain} is still supported,
  one can also use this new format:
<pre>
      \bibulus{citationstyle=numerical,
               namesformat=initials-surname,
               % ...
               blockpunctuation=.}
</pre>
<p>
Bibulus is released under the GNU Public Licence which among other
things means you get the source code and are free to make any changes
you want.

<h3>But...</h3>
Although the above information is true, Bibulus is still not really
usable.  Hopefully it won't be too long before we can wave goodbye to
BibTeX, but for the time being Bibulus is unfortunately really only
for developers.  If you just want to use it, then please join the
mailing list called <tt>bibulus-users</tt> (see more below) to receive
information about new releases.

<h2>Practical information</h2>

<h3>How do I get started?</h3>
First <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=bibulus">download
Bibulus</a>,
unpack it, and read the file <tt>README</tt> in the
<tt>doc</tt> directory.  You might also want to read the manual pages
that are installed together with Bibulus.  If you have further
questions, then join our mailing lists.

<h3>Mailing lists?</h3>
There are two <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/mail/?group=bibulus">mailing
lists</a>, one for developers and one for users.

<h3>Tasks, bugs, CVS</h3>

Please go to the <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibulus">development
pages</a> for this and more!  We could really use more people,
so please get in touch if you want to help!

<h2>Some frequently asked questions...</h2>

<h3>Is there any documentation?</h3>
Yes, there's a <a href="doc.html">couple of documents</a>.

<h3>Why is it called "Bibulus"?</h3>
"Bibulus" means <em>fond of drink</em>, <em>thirsty</em> in Latin.
Furthermore, M. Calpurnius Bibulus was consul in Rome together with
C. Iulius C&aelig;sar in the year 59 BC.
<p>
The name is chosen in the hope that the program will be fond of
"drinking" many books, and that it may be useful to the world of
typesetting systems.

<h3>What is Bibulus called in Greek?</h3>
Bibulus is called Βύβλος in Greek.

<h3>What's the logo?</h3>
Unfortunately I don't have the skills to draw a good logo.
Staying in the Perl/TeX tradition, it would be nice to associate an
animal with Bibulus.  I'm kind of imagining an old friendly librarian
who drinks a little too much -- perhaps a tiger (but certainly not
a lion, a cat or a camel).  Could <em>you</em> help?

<h3>Is Bibulus open-source software?</h3>
Yes, Bibulus is copyright (c) 2003-2004 by Thomas M. Widmann and
others under the GNU
Public Licence version 2.

<h3>Are there other projects like Bibulus?</h3>
There are several projects that try to improve BibTeX.
Most of them are still somewhat tied to BibTeX's bibliographic
databases or to its style definitions, and they are not as
multilingual as Bibulus.
