<H3>The Golem@Home Project</H3>

<P style="border-style: solid">NOTE: The golem@Home project has concluded. After
accumulating several Million CPU hours on this project and reviewing many
evolved creatures we have concluded that merely more CPU is not sufficient to
evolve complexity: The evolutionary process appears to be hitting a complexity
barrier that is not traversable using direct mutation-selection processes, due
to the exponential nature of the problem. We are now developing new theories
about additional mechanisms that are necessary for the synthetic evolution of
complex life forms. Some of these new mechanisms are based on ideas of
modularity, regularity, hierarchy, symbiosis and co-evolution. These ideas are
resulting in a new generation of artificial-life systems. If you are interested
in our developments, please follow our recent publications at <a href="http://demo.cs.brandeis.edu/papers/">Brandeis
DEMO Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.mae.cornell.edu/cadlab/">Cornell CAD Lab</a>.
We thank the more than 30,000 participants for their assistance, and hope it was
an enlightening experience.</P>

<P><b>You are still welcome to install and run the Golem@home client for your
own curiosity. The Golem server will not be running, however you can exchange
individuals with other clients by directly keying-in their IP-addresses in the
communication property sheet, or by saving/loading individuals and sending them
by email.</b></P>

<P>The Golem@Home Project is a screensaver aimed at harnessing
idle CPU power across the Internet to perform massively distributed
evolutionary computation. By installing this software you are
volunteering your computer to participate in this distributed
AI experiment. While you participate, any creatures born (evolved)
on your computer are copyrighted to you. At any point you may
uninstall this program and thus discontinue your participation.</P>

<P>The Golem program is a screen saver. Once you complete the
installation, click the right mouse button on your desktop to
activate desktop properties dialog, and select &quot;Golem&quot;
from the list under the Screen Saver tab. Thereafter, whenever
Golem is activated it will continue evolving bodies and brains
of electromechanical robots, and animate some on the screen. Occasionally
(say, once in a week or two), if a network connection is available,
one or few evolved creatures might migrate from your computer
to another Golem screen saver that happens to be active on the
net, and some new ones might migrate into your Golem program.
For security considerations Golem will exchange only data with
other programs, and will not receive or transmit executable files.
Furthermore, for privacy considerations Golem will only transmit
data associated with the Golem project. In any case, you may use
the advanced settings communication tab to disable incoming communications
or all communications entirely. This program does not need to
connect to a server to run. It will work fine in an isolated environment.
You can key-in IP addresses of other participants you know from
the eGroups and allow your programs to echange material, or you
can directly save and load Golem files, and exchange them by E-mail.</P>

ISMAP>From time to time, Golem will check if a version update
is available. If so, a new version will be downloaded automatically
directly from the DEMO Lab at Brandeis University. For security
reasons, no other source will be used. Again, automatic version
update can be disabled at the advanced settings communication
tab. If you disable this option, please check this site from time
to time to see if any major changes occur, or ask us to notify
you by email.</P>

<P>Creatures born on your computer are copyrighted to you according
to the contact information you provide at installation or at the
advanced settings identification tab. They will carry your ownership
information during their entire life span, even when they leave
your computer. If communication is enabled, this information will
be accessible to others. You may change this information or enter
false identification at any time.</P>

<P>To minimize human intervention in this experiment, you have
little control over the evolution of these creatures. They will
evolve autonomously. At most, you may have indirect control by
changing population size, wiping or reverting an entire population,
or changing the landscape in which they evolve. You may try to
use the control you have to make the creatures evolving on your
computer better and more robust, so that they survive when they
migrate to other machines. This is a form of human machine co-evolution.</P>

<P>We reserve the right to publish any results and statistics
obtained in this experiment.</P>

<P>If you have any questions about this study or your rights,
please contact us.</P>

<P><B>To download</B> the installation package for <A HREF="download/Golem245.zip">Golem
2.45, click here</A> Win95/98/NT (740K). After download, <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/">unzip</A>
the file into a directory and click on &quot;Setup.exe&quot;.
After installation, right-click your desktop and select &quot;Golem&quot;
as your active screensaver. If you are missing DLLs, and before
e-mailing questions, please check out our <A HREF="golemfaq.html">frequently
asked questions (faq)</A> page.</P>

<P>This project is in its initial phases. Join the <A HREF="http://lists.brandeis.edu/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?enter=golem">Golem@Home
mailing list</A> for annoucments of new revisions, bug fixes and
progress reports. The list will only be used for the Golem@Home
project and will not be given to third parties. You may unsubscribe
at any time. There is also an independent <A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/group/golem-at-home">eGroup
news group</A> you can join.</P>

<H3>Print your own models</H3>

<P>If you have access to a 3D printer and would like the STL file
to print one of the robots for yourself, let us know. Similarly,
if you have evolved a robot and would like us to generate an STL
file for that robot, contact us.</P>
