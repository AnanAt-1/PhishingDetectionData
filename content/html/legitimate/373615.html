If you evoke hate, at least people care enough to feel <em>something</em>. When you evoke apathy, you basically
                                        don&#x2019;t exist.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Enter the Jacksonville Jaguars. If you&#x2019;re still reading this, you&#x2019;re more interested in the Jaguars than the common &#xA0;fan. Perhaps no team in pro football evokes more apathy than Wayne Weaver&#x2019;s
                                        club. How does a team get to this point?</p>
                                    <div class="w190 right"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/11/16/sports/football/16jets190/articleInline.jpg" alt="Jets vs Jaguars"><span class="credit">Kathy Willens/Associated Press</span> <span class="caption">The Jaguars are a mediocre team. Maurice Jones-Drew (32) is one player who stands out.</span></div>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A big part of the Jaguars&#x2019; problem, obviously, has been poor attendance. Duval County, a college football hotbed, is lukewarm about the pro game. Factor in an economic downturn that rocked Northeast Florida as
                                        hard as any area in the nation and you get losses of 17,000 season-ticket holders in &#x2019;09 and weekly television blackouts. The Jaguars reduced season ticket prices in two sections in the upper deck by $90,
                                        in four sections in the lower bowl by $100, and in two club sections by $300. As of Thursday, the Jags have sold 37,066 season tickets, with 12,706 being new season ticket sales. They need 50,957 to avoid blackouts.
                                        In short, the organization&#x2019;s days in Jacksonville could be numbered.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But let&#x2019;s focus on between-the-sideline factors. In football, you don&#x2019;t evoke apathy through repeated failure. The Detroit Lions might not have many fans these days, but few people are apathetic toward
                                        the team. The Lions have been so bad that they&#x2019;ve become interesting. The Raiders are the same way, to an extent. Apathy might be the worst <em>scenario</em> for an N.F.L. franchise, but it&#x2019;s not achieved
                                        by being <em>the</em> worst N.F.L. franchise. Rather, it&#x2019;s achieved by being resoundingly mediocre.</p>

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite playoff appearances in &#x2019;05 and &#x2019;07, the Jaguars &#x2013; who are 57-55 in <strong>Jack Del Rio&#x2019;s</strong> seven years as &#xA0;coach &#x2013; have seemingly perfected the art of mediocrity.
                                        Quarterback <strong>David Garrard</strong> was given a $60 million contract &#x2013; richest in team history &#x2013; after upsetting the Steelers in the &#x2019;07 wild-card round. Since then, Garrard has posted
                                        passer ratings of 81.7 and 83.5. He has been prone to turnovers when asked to do more than simply manage a ball-control offense. Though his character is fine, the front office has subtly questioned Garrard&#x2019;s
                                        desire and leadership. (It&#x2019;s never a good sign when &#xA0;articles are written about how the quarterback is trying to become more of a &#x201C;vocal leader&#x201D; at age 32.)<br>
                                        <span id="more-46025"></span><br> Garrard&#x2019;s mediocrity is reflective of this &#xA0;offense. Coordinator <strong>Dirk Koetter</strong> has had his hands tied by a front five that was ransacked by injuries
                                        in &#x2019;08 and limited by the learning curve of two rookie tackles (<strong>Eugene Monroe</strong> and <strong>Eben Britton</strong>) in &#x2019;09. The dearth of experience and talent at wide receiver hasn&#x2019;t
                                        helped.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Defensively, Jacksonville is just now finding its identity. Last season, Del Rio essentially relegated coordinator <strong>Mel Tucker</strong> to defensive backs coach and took a very hands-on approach. But Del Rio
                                        vacillated between putting his ho-hum front seven personnel in a 3-4 or 4-3. By season&#x2019;s end, the Jags were running some of the most simplistic zone coverages the sport has to offer and failing to put any
                                        pressure on quarterbacks (their 14 sacks were the fifth fewest in N.F.L. history). It was a formula for failure and, in that sense, it succeeded.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Of course, &#xA0;drastic change is commonplace in the league. Although Jacksonville&#x2019;s two biggest problems &#x2013; ticket sales and Garrard &#x2013; have not been fixed, there&#x2019;s still reason to hope in
                                        2010. Koetter, somewhat of a passing game wizard, has been told to open up the offense. Powerful assistant coaches and Del Rio cronies Mike Tice (tight ends) and Kennedy Pola (running backs) are &#xA0;gone, leaving
                                        Koetter more freedom to run his show. Even with a more aggressive aerial approach, that show will star <strong>Maurice</strong> <strong>Jones-Drew</strong>, a top-five running back who rushed for 1,391 yards in
                                        his first season as the featured weapon last year. The hope is that Jones-Drew isn&#x2019;t a lone fighter now that the young offensive tackles and receivers have a year under their belts.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Defensively, Del Rio has settled on a one-gap attacking 4-3 system. Committing to that system, Jaguars G.M.&#xA0;<strong>Gene Smith</strong> shook up the front seven personnel. Non-achieving defensive end Quentin Groves
                                        was replaced by former Packer <strong>Aaron Kampman</strong>. Defensive tackle John Henderson was released after Smith used the 10th&#xA0;pick in the draft on <strong>Tyson Alualu</strong>. The linebacking corps
                                        has been restructured, with ex-Raider <strong>Kirk Morrison</strong> taking over the middle and athletic <strong>Justin Durant</strong> sliding to Clint Ingram&#x2019;s vacated spot.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Are these changes significant enough to alter this team&#x2019;s fortune and maybe save its future in Jacksonville? Let&#x2019;s find out. (That is, if you care.)</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Offense</strong></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">These days, it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to win with a caretaker quarterback. But that&#x2019;s what the Jaguars will have to do. <strong>David Garrard</strong> is not built to carry a team. He is effective operating
                                        within basic quarterbacking boundaries. Tell him to drop back and make two or three reads against a standard defensive front in a standard down-and-distance situation, and he&#x2019;ll do so with picturesque form.
                                        But tell him to audible against a disguised coverage and then improvise when a blitzer comes clean, and watch a disaster unfold.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite Garrard&#x2019;s limitations &#x2013; which include accuracy under duress and, to a degree, arm strength &#x2013; there is little chance that athletic backup <strong>Luke McCown</strong> will challenge for the
                                        starting job. McCown himself has said as much.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Jaguars will be relying on <strong>Maurice Jones-Drew</strong>, and not just in the run game. Not only is the fifth-year pro a bowling ball of a runner with breakaway speed, he&#x2019;s the best pass-blocking back
                                        in football. Jones-Drew is also a good enough receiver to run routes out of the backfield and make catches on the move (53 receptions last season).</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It won&#x2019;t be easy for <strong>Dirk Koetter</strong> to resist the urge to lean too heavily on Jones-Drew. Backup running back <strong>Rashad Jennings</strong> is too methodical with the ball in his hands. Sixth-round
                                        rookie <strong>Deji Karim</strong> has potential as a third-down back, but that&#x2019;s where Jones-Drew truly excels. The Jags should consider giving more carries to fullback <strong>Greg Jones</strong>. Before
                                        knee problems hurt his career, Jones was a power-running tailback.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The entire offense will benefit from the inevitable improvements along the front line. Left tackle <strong>Eugene Monroe</strong> became more assertive during his rookie season. He has the tools; his key will be &#xA0;maintaining
                                        technique while playing with aggression. Second-year right tackle <strong>Eben Britton</strong> is in a similar boat, although his challenge isn&#x2019;t to play with aggression as much as polish his footwork and
                                        mechanics.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Even with the youthful tackles, this line&#x2019;s greatest improvements need to occur inside. Veteran center <strong>Brad Meester</strong> is washed up and should be replaced. Guard <strong>Uche</strong> <strong>Nwaneri</strong>                                        is terrible in space, but he&#x2019;s the only logical replacement at center. Nwaneri may be needed at right guard, though, given that <strong>Vince Manuwai</strong> hasn&#x2019;t looked the same since his &#x2019;08
                                        knee injury. Manuwai was the left guard in &#x2019;09, but that job will go to <strong>Justin Smiley</strong>, one of the best pull-blockers in football. Because Smiley has battled &#xA0;shoulder problems, Jacksonville
                                        was able to obtain him for only a seventh-round pick. If Smiley is unable to contribute, expect journeyman <strong>Kynan Forney</strong> to get a look.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Tight end <strong>Marcedes Lewis</strong> is also a meaningful part of the run-blocking efforts. Lewis has a great frame and is good for 35 or 40 catches. A substantial bulk of the catches this year will be made by
                                        receiver <strong>Mike Sims-Walker</strong>. Think of the fourth-year pro as a slightly smaller version of Brandon Marshall. Sims-Walker is a terrific route runner &#x2013; particularly inside the numbers &#x2013;
                                        and he has the outstanding hands and supple athleticism required to make acrobatic catches.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Consistency was an issue for Sims-Walker last season, in large part because of the players around him. Losing Torry Holt as the No. 2 receiver won&#x2019;t help stabilize things. The Jags hope speedy second-year target
                                        <strong>Mike Thomas</strong> will contribute more, but the stocky 5-8, 198-pounder might be better suited for the slot. Problem is, the other options are dicey. Veteran <strong>Troy Williamson</strong> is fast but
                                        unreliable. Newcomer <strong>Kassim Osgood</strong> has good size but has spent most of his seven N.F.L. years on special teams. Last year&#x2019;s fifth-round pick <strong>Jarett Dillard </strong>caught only six
                                        passes before breaking his leg/ankle in November.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Defense</strong></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Jaguars are desperate to put pressure on the quarterback in 2010. They were desperate two years ago, as well, when they traded up in the first-round to draft <strong>Derrick</strong> <strong>Harvey</strong> eighth,
                                        then traded up six spots in the second round to get Quentin Groves. Those two combined for eight sacks in two seasons. Groves played with little intelligence and was traded. Harvey is still here, clinging to a starting
                                        job. He knows there&#x2019;s a reason <strong>Gene Smith</strong> recently drafted two defensive ends &#x2013; <strong>Austen Lane</strong> and <strong>Larry Hart</strong> &#x2013; in the fifth round.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But for the first time in his career, Harvey is playing in a fitting left defensive end role, where he&#x2019;ll be able to focus on his strength: stopping the run. Harvey doesn&#x2019;t have the quickness or fluid
                                        hips to rush the passer, which is why the Jags invested $26 million in <strong>Aaron Kampman</strong> ($11 million up front). Kampman won&#x2019;t cash his checks and relax the way Hugh Douglas did after signing
                                        with this team for big money a few years ago, but coming off November ACL surgery, there&#x2019;s no guarantee he&#x2019;ll reclaim his dominant form.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Jags have already experienced the agony of seeing an expensive free agent defensive end battle injury &#x2013; that was the story of <strong>Reggie Hayward&#x2019;s</strong> tenure here. Hayward missed almost all
                                        of the &#x2019;06 season (with a torn Achilles&#x2019;) and of the &#x2019;09 season (stress fracture in his fibula). After unsuccessfully testing free agency, the 31-year-old re-signed for one year, $850,000, but
                                        was released July 7.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With these ends, it&#x2019;s vital that the Jaguars generate pressure inside. Because second-year defensive tackle <strong>Terrance Knighton</strong> is a two-gap plugger, the pass-rushing onus falls on first-round
                                        rookie <strong>Tyson Alualu</strong>. Alualu was a reach at No. 10 in the draft, but scouts thought his speed and nastiness fit the system. Third-round pick <strong>D&#x2019;Anthony Smith</strong> is also expected
                                        to be a good fit and should see plenty of snaps right away. Also, don&#x2019;t discount <strong>Atiyyah Ellison</strong>; like Knighton, he is a clogger who gets off blocks well.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is a belief that middle linebacker <strong>Kirk Morrison</strong> will fix the linebacking corps. Wrong. Morrison was available for trade (the Jags got him for a fourth-rounder) because he spearheaded a Raider
                                        run defense that ranked near the very bottom of the league five straight years. Jacksonville will soon learn that he lacks instincts and lateral range.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With Morrison inside, athletic <strong>Justin Durant</strong> moves outside, where, coaches hope, he&#x2019;ll be a more consistent tackler. Durant has star potential, but maturity has been a concern. Outside linebacker
                                        <strong>Daryl Smith</strong> is popular because he&#x2019;s versatile and reliable. However, Smith isn&#x2019;t Jacksonville&#x2019;s best linebacker; <strong>Russell Allen</strong> is. That&#x2019;s right, Russell
                                        Allen &#x2013; the &#x2019;09 undrafted rookie from San Diego State. Allen exhibits a sixth sense for the ball and has surprising athleticism as a downhill attacker. If the Jaguar coaches have any guts, they&#x2019;ll
                                        insert him into the starting lineup.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Last season, coaches had the guts to bench former first-round free safety <strong>Reggie Nelson</strong> for the final two games. Nelson has not responded well to demands for versatility (he has &#xA0;been asked to
                                        play centerfield, in the box and at slot corner). The only reason he&#x2019;s getting one more &#x201C;make or break&#x201D; season is because the front office did not feel comfortable signing free agent Darren
                                        Sharper.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If Nelson is benched, strong safety <strong>Gerald Alexander</strong> will probably slide to centerfield, where he&#x2019;s probably more effective anyway. <strong>Sean Considine</strong> would man the box, with coordinator
                                        <strong>Mel Tucker</strong> praying that offenses don&#x2019;t attack him through the air. In fact, Considine might be too much of a liability in coverage; perhaps &#xA0;<strong>Anthony</strong> <strong>Smith</strong>,
                                        a dime back, would get a look.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At corner, <strong>Rashean Mathis</strong> is barking for a new contract. But the physical eighth-year playmaker must prove he can stay healthy. (Mathis missed six games last season and a total of six games in &#x2019;07-&#x2019;08.)
                                        Second-year corner <strong>Derek Cox</strong> is a natural but not yet unyielding. Nickelback <strong>Tyron Brackenridge</strong> plays with passion, but there&#x2019;s a reason coaches asked Nelson to defend the
                                        slot last season.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Special Teams</strong></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">After missing 10 field goals in 2009, the generally reliable <strong>Josh Scobee</strong> spent the offseason in Scottsdale working with famed kicking guru Gary Zauner. To be fair, five of Scobee&#x2019;s misses were
