<h1>XML well-formedness checker and validator</h1>
<p>
Use this form to check an XML document for well-formedness and (optionally)
DTD-validity.  External entity references are included, even when not validating.
If the document is well-formed, the parser outputs the corresponding
<a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/canonxml.html">canonical XML</a>.
</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This service is provided for occasional checking of
XML documents.  Any other use is prohibited.
Note that we keep detailed log files and report 
all suspected abuses to the relevant authorities.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>
The checker uses the
<a href="http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html">RXP</a>
parser, written by Richard Tobin.  RXP is part of the
<a href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/ltxml2/">LT-XML 2</a> system,
which is available from the
<a href="http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk">Language Technology Group</a>
at the University of Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
If you find yourself using this service frequently, I suggest you download
RXP or LT-XML 2 and use it locally.
</p>
<form action="xml-check.cgi">
<p>
URL: <input type="text" name="url" size="50"/>
<input type="submit" value="check it"/>
<input type="reset" value="clear"/>
</p>
<p>
<input type="checkbox" name="validate"/> validate?
<br />
<input type="checkbox" name="namespaces"/> do namespace processing?
</p><p>
XML namespaces don't mesh well with DTD-based validity,
so you quite likely won't want to select both validation
and namespace processing.
</p><p>
Only HTTP URLs are allowed.  They are fetched through a proxy, which
might conceivably cache old versions, though as far as I know it doesn't.

<p>
Thanks to Glenn 'devalias' Grant for pointing out a problem with
this checker (now fixed).
