Corrections are welcome ! If you click on the pictures you will get a bigger version. When you are finished push the arrow at the top left of your browser page to go back. This kind of wanders around, side tracking now and then, but there is useful information which sometimes may surprise you and you may find clues to other families. I gathered information because I cannot keep a stone unturned. It was at times very complicated and I would have to take a pencil and paper to bed with me at night to figure the relationships because cousins were marrying cousins and other near relations. It seems to have been a closed social circle into which fresh blood was brought now and then. I have also discovered who the Madison Co AL William Bell  was. The other three brothers in Madison AL may have been cousins.<br />
<br />
The Bell family married lots of Clouds (mostly female Clouds marrying male  Bells) and seem to have had allot of teachers and educated children. Money was spent on their education. This may lead back to Camden and the Quaker community there.  William Cloud 1730 's great grandfather <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:3200814&amp;id=I617135632">William Cloude</a> had become a member of the Friends  (Quakers) in 1634. So they had been Quakers for a hundred years when <a href="http://www.intersurf.com/%7Ebevans/My%20Ancestors/d1245.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">William</a> (please click for a nice site on the Clouds) was born in 1730. The Quakers put high value on education for both sexes and this tradition would have been carried on for generations even after they had given up being Quaker or had been disowned for fighting in the Revolution. William Cloud born in Rockland Manor, Brandywine 100, New Castle Co, DE left SC during the Revolution and took refuge in VA which is why children were being born here and  there in the list below. SC was a terrible place to be in the Rev with Bloody Bill running around killing even children.<br />
<br />
I think there can be little doubt that the Clouds were Quakers or at the very least still tightly associated with the Quaker community. William Guppell/Guphill, of Camden, SC is buried at the Old Quaker Cemetery, Camden, now Kershaw Co, SC with a death date of 1821. They were neighbors of the Clouds. William Guphill married Alice Cloud, daughter of William ca 1730. Following information must be checked by yourself. No verification on my part. William Cloud was b ca 1730 in Brandywine Hundred,New Castle,Delaware (outside of Philadelphia City).   He was descended from <a href="http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:2676274&amp;id=I5913" style="font-weight: bold;">William Cloud</a> from Calne, England, who came over in 1682 on the Ship <a href="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/pa/chester/immig/ships1682.txt?cj=1&amp;o_xid=0000713921&amp;o_lid=0000713921"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">UNICORNE</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></a>owned by William Penn the Quaker.<span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 100%;"> http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/pa/chester/immig/ships1682.txt?cj=1&amp;o_xid=0000713921&amp;o_lid=0000713921<br /><br />Penn came on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Welcome Master</span>: Robert Greenway Date of Arrival: 8/1682  </span>four months earlier.

<br />
William's grandfather was Jeremiah born 7 Feb 1658/1659 in Calne Parish, Calne, Wiltshire, England who arrived on the ship <span style="font-style: italic;">Unicorne</span>.  The ship <span style="font-style: italic;">Unicorne</span> reached Chester County, PA below Philadelphia. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://chester-county-genealogy.com/smartsection.item.116/unicorne-12-1682.html">Date of Arrival</a>: 12th month/1682</span> (That does not mean Dec. to the Quakers) Master: Thomas Cooper Listed as passengers: William Cloude and sons William Jr, Jeremiah and Robert. See <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:3200814&amp;id=I617135621">Jeremiah's</a> will at bottom of blog.<br />
<br />
William Cloud, son of William  of Brandywine Hundred, first appeared in S. C. by official records on the third day of January 1765 when he took a land grant on Fishing Creek in Chester Co., S.C., then old Craven County. There are deeds in Fairfield and in Charleston  showing ALICE CLOUD, the wife of WILLIAM CLOUD, as signing dower rights. Known children of William Cloud (son of William and grandson of Jeremiah) with marriage to Alice Hardin b abt 1726.<br />

<br />
Anyway, my interest started this time with my children's distant great great great great uncle James Meadows who was son of Isham Meadows born 1765 and his last wife Martha Stephens b ca 1776. Isham and Martha followed his first son Ransom Meadows from Greene GA to Montgomery Co AL, part of which got cut off to become Lowndes Co AL. They had been living on Stephens Creek in original Wilkes GA which part got cut off to form Greene Co GA in 1802.<br />
<br />
How I got involved with the Bell and Cloud familes was that James Meadows married Ellen A. Poole in 1841 in Lowndes AL. But I could not figure out who she was. It was a mystery. Who were the Pooles?  Finally (I can't remember how) the other day, I hit on some information which led from one stone to the other.  It turned out that Ellen was a young widow in the Meadows neighborhood of Lowndesboro and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hayneville</span>.   She had arrived 6 years earlier---from what I can tell-- from SC.  Ellen A. Serena Daniel Poole was living on her mother's Daniel plantation in Lowndes (1840 Lowndes under Ellen Daniel) with her 2 children because her husband had died after arriving from SC, as did so many from fevers caused by mosquito bites. It is rather swampy there.   I found out she had a daughter which I did not know about and that daughter had married Joseph Bell.  Ellen's grandson had written an informative letter to his son which was on rootsweb. This letter opened up a Pandora's Box for me. <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Click for entire 2 page   <a href="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/al/lowndes/history/letters/apbell.txt" style="font-weight: bold;">Letter from Augustus Poole Bell.</a></span></span><br />
<br />
I have been told there was a book <span style="font-style: italic;">"Wyatt Thomas Bell:  Ancestors Descendants Connnections</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-style: italic;">"  </span>written by a descendant of Wyatt Thomas Bell who was the son of Ananias N. Bell and Sarah Ann Huckabee who had come with his children to Lowndes about 1855-56 and if any of you have copied pages from this book, I would love to share them on this blogger. (Since I live in Germany and do not have dollars to buy this book.)  Ananias Bell migrated to Lowndes AL because his brother Joseph Bell had already settled there many years before - the father may have moved on to MS right away.<br />
<br />
Joseph Bell had stayed in Lowndes and had acquired 3650 acres in 2 plantations near <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hayneville</span>.  Ananias settled a mile from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hayneville</span> on the road to Litahatchee on the plantation with the double log house where Augustus Poole Bell had been born.  I think Ananias bought it from brother Joseph as soon as he arrived from Fairfield in 1855-6. Son  Wyatt married a grandchild of Ellen A. Serena Daniel who had married 2nd James Meadows (Sr). In fact 2 of Ellen A. Serena's and Augustus Poole grandchildren by daughter, Ellen Serena,  married 2 children of Ananias N. Bell.  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span>Augustus Poole Bell mentions that his  fathers sister had a child "Eva" who married William H. Poole. Well, I knew that he was Ellen`s son but had not proved it.  So that piece of information drove me crazy because I knew exactly which Poole he was talking about but had never found out what happened to William H. Poole. So suddenly I sort of knew whom he married. "Eva" was of course only her nickname. Nobody named their child Eva in those days. It took me days, but I finally found out her name was Martha Evelyn Cloud and the great granddaughter of William Cloud who had named  the father of Joseph and Ananias Bell in his Fairfield SC will in 1811: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vincent Hardy Bell</span>. I can only imagine that they are also a descendant of Vincent Hardy of Virginia, as well, and those Bell people are related to my children's John Hardy of VA.<span lang="EN-US"><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span>For more information on the Meadows and Hardy families in Lowndes and Coosa AL click here:<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><a href="http://ransom-middleton-meadows.blogspot.com/" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Isham Meadows and Nancy Peebles Browning descendants</a></span><span lang="EN-US"><br /><br />A descendant wrote me about the Bells yesterday and said in part this:</span><span style="font-style: italic;">".... had quite a bit about Augustus Poole Bell and his children who were all educated, artistic, and very eccentric.  The story is that all was lost after the Civil War and due to mismanagment by a step father .  The family moved in mass to Texas for some reason and then on to California by the 1920s.  Lots of mysteries.  Much of what I know of the Bell family comes from a book by Pauline Bell Lauderdale called "Wyatt Thomas Belll:  Ancestors Descendants Connnections.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-style: italic;"> "</span><span lang="EN-US">The step grandfather alluded to above was James W. Watson. He and Ellen married in Butler 1864 and Joseph says his mother died in the fall of 1864 in Butler. One of the plantations may have been in Butler.</span><br />

This foto could be 1895? It could have been many of our families. I put it in because it sets the mood of  back then and it was probably taken in a county near Lowndes. They look like they have a small tatered flag on the porch behind them. Families sitting on the porch at night and families getting their pictures taken by traveling photographers. Although of course it was not all our families who had such nice clothes as these for their daughters. Of course the Clouds and Bells seem always to have a certain amount of wealth and would have had these clothes, at the least. Joseph Bell had 3650 acres so he would have had maybe even better clothes for his family! But he was dead with no one of his stature to manage the plantations. It looks like the clothes were freshly made in advance of the foto. The style of the house is not one of dirt farmers- it is better and built by a carpenter with nice cornice work and details not seen by the normal folk like the house below taken at Horsestomp Community up in&nbsp;</div>

I think the above left family has seen better times. It looks like there are great grandparents maybe born 1815, 12 children-mostly girls, one set of parents born maybe 1835, one couple and a widowed daughter who is sitting in dark clothing born about 1855. The house looks run down in that it is not painted. I know however that some did so and it did not mean they were poor. But on the other hand maybe this is a once well off family who survived the Civil War and still had some clothes on their backs but did not have means to paint the house in 35 years.<br />
<br />
Left: The middle aged woman with the baby, as well as the child on the far left at Horsestomp, Coosa in 1907 were descended from an aristocratic Virginia family of tobacco planters. Her grandfather <a href="http://robert-hardy-sc-to-alabama.blogspot.com/" style="font-weight: bold;">Robert Hardy</a> had owned a couple thousand acres in Edgefield SC before coming to Montgomery Co in 1818 and helping his cousin in law Stephen Crenshaw build roads. They lived at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hayneville</span> before moving up to Coosa in 1837 to escape the mosquitoes at Big Swamp. So you can see how far the family has fallen in general. There are no cornices or nice columns on their porch and there are no windows. The gentleman sitting on the chair William Archibald  MeHearg/Maharg has 3 revolutionary soldier ancestors fighting in SC- one from Raburn's Creek in Laurens SC.<br />

left: The 1850 census has Vincent Sr in Lowndes MISS with sons Leroy 22 and James 35, as well as Penelope age 44 and Adeline age 18 and Shannon R, age 16 (1834). <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Vincent Bell Sr's  sons were Vincent 1807, Joseph 1809, William, James 1815, </span></span>Annanias 1818  (may have been called "Asa" and other variations), Osborne Robert 1822 married <a href="http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=grndslammr&amp;id=I06218">Anna Baker</a>, and LeRoy Bell 1826 who was in both the 1850 Lowndes AL on Sept 22 and Lowndes MS on Oct 8. The 2 daughters of Vincent are a puzzle but one of the daughter's daughter called Eva married cousin William Poole. Also in Lowndes MISS are other resdients of Fairfield Co SC.<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">  Vincent Bell Sr seems to have a wife or daughter in Lowndes Co MISS  - Penelope. </span></span>Vincent H.

The 1820 Census locates him in Fairfield County, SC. But in 1830 I see only his son there.  Gus does related that his father Joseph came soon after Alabama opened up in 1819, so maybe the family came about 1821 after the 1820 census. <a class="textlink" href="http://www.mdot.state.ms.us/maps/County_maps/Lowndes.pdf" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="185" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AEn0k_sqA1WEDIYVPEmGblQ9P62AJqjtQwwBpk7tiliFCPI7Vy_R8JhUAn-uIJ0iMi4tkKmdss9njuOo1aaMwlqdeRmEN3KhGyF02jZyFCWPxgi40Z2fZQlVD7BaSWKTfjUvyGBE=s0-d" width="125"><br />           Click HERE to see  full size D.O.T.

In 1830 I do not identify them anywhere, except that Vincent junior has stayed in Fairfield and continues to live there thru 1850.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;">
<span lang="EN-US">I do find it interesting that in my searches I found not only many former slaves with the same Bell family names in Lowndes AL, but there were more mulatto Bells in Lowndes than black Bells. Whose plantation had they been living on? Had Joseph been educating them secretly? On 3500 acres you can hide allot. Who had created all the Mulatto descendants? Was it Joseph Bell? or the Peter Bell who had been in earlier census data. Why was Joseph so satisfied with this life that he waited till 31 to marry? It surely made me curious seeing such a high percentage of mulatto citizens named Bell in Lowndes.</span><span lang="EN-US">  Why did Joseph die so early in life anyway? Why did so many former slaves take the Bell names, including "Vincent" and "Joseph"?</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;">
<span lang="EN-US">The step father was James W. Watson. </span><span lang="EN-US">I looked up on Ancestry that Ellen S Bell married James W Watson on 19 Aug 1864 in Butler Co. When in doubt look in Butler Co for the Bells. I tried to figure out what happened to the children after Joseph Bell died in 1861 and Ellen in the fall of 1864 and I just do not know, except for 2 places where his 2 girls went.They did not stay with Watson, even though as husband he must have inherited most of the plantation-I think that is how it was in those days.   I tried to find out about the families the 2 girls were with. Well one was simple because it was uncle Osborne Bell who had a store. The other place was the Herberts, an old Fairfield District SC family, and the neighbor of Ellen and James Meadows in 1860.</span></div>

In 1860 they were worth a fortune for that time. I had no idea when I started this search that we were talking about a very rich man. His real estate was worth $94,240 which is probably 9 million today? I assume Joseph's mother tried to continue and got talked into marrying someone to help her then she died overcome by the difficulties of managing over 3500 acres. I would like to know about the situation from the slaves perspective and whether they helped or not. How their views were toward the family. It would have been impossible for someone to manage 3500 acres without the loyal support of their slaves-- other than keeping the slaves under clever overseers who were probably all gone to war.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;">
<span lang="EN-US">Herbert married Louisa Debard on the 5th of Feb 1860 just before the war (and before the census so I found them by accident misindexed) after 12 years of being a widower. Debard is short for De Bardeleben which it became in Huguenot Charleston SC. They are the descendants of the aristocratic German family Arthur Franz Von Bardeleben b 3 May 1757 Kattenbruch,  Westfalen, Germany.</span><span lang="EN-US"> His son Henri/Henry migrated from  to Montgomery Co Co AL and died there 27 Jan 1853. Montgomery city is only 18 miles from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hayneville</span>. Louisa had been living with Thomas Debard in Lowndes in 1850. He had been born 1812 in Kentucky. He had one slave and lived 2 houses away from James Meadows and 13 houses away form the Herberts who had 7 slaves, not many for those days or compared to James Meadows who had 28 and was younger than Herbert who must have made his living in other ways than cotton.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: georgia;">
<span lang="EN-US">In 1840 Thomas Debard is in Lowndes (indexed as Debord) with no women and 2 men.  I doubt he ever had any children so there is no record of him I could find. There were several Debords who immigrated to Pulaski, KY by 1820, probably from NC via VA from the old VA family- not the same as the Debardeleben Charleston family.</span></div>

<span lang="EN-US">Some people call Edward Hampton, instead, Edwin Edward, but that is not what he gives in the census-he probably had 2 middle names or one was a nick name.

P. Bell- <span style="font-weight: bold;">Augustus Poole Bell</span>: </span></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">I was born in October 1849 in a double log house. My father hadn't bought the 1400-acre plantation then. He bought it about 3 years after. He sold the plantation on which I was born to Uncle Annanias Bell. Mother died in the Fall of 1864. We were then living in Butler County, Adjoining Lowndes. Uncle William Poole married a niece of father's, his sister's child. Their children on their father's side are my first cousins, and on their mother's my second. Uncle William Poole went into the army in 1862, was wounded in the battle of Franklin, Tenn. In the Fall of 1864 and died of blood poison. Cousin Eva, his wife died early in the Fall of 1860.My father, five brothers and two sisters were born and raised in South Carolina on a farm, where they stayed and worked on the farm until they were 21. William Bell moved to Georgia, died there, leaving a widow, son, daughter and a little grandson. He was poor. Jim Bell moved to Mississippi. I don't know his circumstances. Only that he had little or no wealth. Annanias, Osborne, and LeRoy moved to Alabama. Uncle Lee had nothing; he was overseer for my father 1 year. My father, Joseph Bell, moved to Alabama soon after it was admitted into the Union in 1819. I became acquainted with an old man in 1865 that knew my father when he owned only a horse, a bridle, and saddle and was teaching school. He died in July 1861 at the age of only 52. He left 2 plantations well stocked, the home place something more than 1400 acres, the other plantation in an adjoining county, 1240 acres, and 92 Negroes.</span>  <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Although it was said he died in Autaga Co.,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">he is buried in his family graveyard on his plantation near Haynesville, Lowndes Co , Al between Hayneville and Letohatchie. We lived about 4 miles from Haynesville and about 3 1/3 miles from Letohatchie, which are about 7 miles apart. We lived about 1/2 mile off the public road, the road running through the plantation, cutting off 400 or 500 acres on one side, from the settlements. My father's tomb stands on a little hill sloping on all sides alike, about 200 yards from the public road on the side toward the settlements. He selected the spot yards before he died. My brother Willie, my third brother, has been buried there also.</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">My father, five brothers and two sisters were born and raised in South Carolina on a farm, where they stayed and worked on the farm until they were 21. <span style="font-weight: bold;">William Bell</span> moved to Georgia.....<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jim Bell </span>moved to Mississippi.....<span style="font-weight: bold;">Annanias, Osborne, and LeRoy Bell</span> moved to Alabama. Uncle Lee ... was overseer for my father 1 year...Uncle Annanias was younger than my father, but married first, his first child being 7 or 8 years older than I was. He lived 3 miles from us, on the road from Hayneville to Letohatchie and 1 mile from Hayneville.......Uncle Osborne was still younger.... lived in Montgomery County 18 miles from us. ... My brother Joe and I boarded in his family when going to our first school. I was 10, Joe 8. Uncle Osborne's oldest child, N.J. Bell, was in the banking business when he died, worth about $1,000,000.</span></div>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">In the letter above, uncle Gus forgot to talk about uncle Vincent H. Bell back in SC after whom Gus's brother was named.   </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">The war came to Gus when he was a young man and there must have been great confusion and not allot of family visiting. But he sure remembers an awful lot and it is wonderful to read. because he did not say the names of the girls, it drove me crazy and I worked for days to try to figure them out. With thehelp of Ancestry and a descendant in Cal. who had a list of people mentioned in the 1853 Vincent H Bell testament, I was able to put 2 and 2 together and figure out quite alot of these unconnected people and found out how much cousins married cousins. Bells married Clouds and Pooles married Bells. Pooles married Clouds. it must have been an old aristocratic South. To think that Joseph Bell had 2 plantations totalling 3650 acres makes him one of the "Great Planters" in Alabama.</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div>

Jerusha looks like the type of girl who loved to be outside riding her horse and she can hardly bear being inside photographed and having on those fancy garments.  Alabama Gordon looks pinched and severe and never quite happy unless everything is running perfectly and HER way. A mother who demanded the best from her children and never let them get away with anything. Hugh William is looking aged from the War but is relaxed and has a completely different character than Alabama.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span><a href="http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=eilandfamily&amp;id=I01347" style="font-weight: bold;">Confederate Veteran, Vol. XXVIII, 1920 </a><br />

HIS ESTATE WAS PROBATED IN DAVIDSON COUNTY TENNESSEE PROBATE COURT IN SEPTEMBER 1846, BOOK 14, PAGE 708. SEE LDS MICROFILM. HIS ESTATE WAS ALSO PROBATED AND CONTESTED IN THE MADISON COUNTY ALABAMA COURTS BETWEEN 1847 AND 1888. SEE PROBATE COURT CASE NO. 1779 AND CHANCERY COURT CASES NO. 1329 AND 1425. THE COURT RECORDS  ARE STORED IN THE LEGAL LIBRARY, LOCATED ON THE COURT HOUSE SQUARE IN HUNTSVILLE, AL. Presumeably William's kin Francis also moved with him. Francis died in Madison. It may be that Vincent Bell (married to Ellen Cloud) and his son Joseph Bell  travelled along too as Joseph's son Augustus  said his father came shortly after Alabama became a state in 1819  and it thought William (married to <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:2789374&amp;id=I558069415" style="font-weight: bold;">Sarah CLOUD</a>) traveled to Madison Co Al between 1821-1825. William and Vincent were first cousins. Here is a letter from William to Fairfield SC:<br />
(as copied from Tom King's webpage 041099)<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">COPY OF A LETTER WRITTEN BY WILLIAM CLOUD OF ALABAMA</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IN 1838 TO HIS SON JOHN E. CLOUD </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IN FAIRFIELD COUNTY,   SOUTH CAROLINA </span><br />
Note: The <a href="http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:3255764&amp;id=I644505715" style="font-weight: bold;">original letter</a> was hand written by <a href="http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=:3255764&amp;id=I644505715" style="font-weight: bold;">Cloud, William</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br />
in 1838. It was hand copied into a deed book of Fairfield County, South Carolina;<br />
since it was related to the property transfer mentioned in the letter. The author of this book<br />
received a photocopy of the handwritten deed book record and typed this copy. Spaces with (-----)  were unreadable. Original spelling has not been corrected.<br />

<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%; font-style: italic;">Alabama State,<br />Madison County<br />July 6, 1838<br />To: John E. Cloud<br />Dear Sir:<br />I recd. your letter rote the 4th day of June and mailed the 7th in 24<br />days which gave me great satisfaction to hear that all was well. I duly observed the<br />contents of your letter and your wishes therein contained and what you said about the land and it was thought there would be some dispute about the land next to Bowels. and Isaac Aldedge's<br />fears about making title for fear of a squabble there.  There is no need as you said of a warranty letter from me as Isaac Arledge has the power of ---ance to make the letter. Tell him and let him see this letter and  he may ask Person-------- he could be liable in any way whatever, for I am sure every Neighbor there knows my land nearly as well as I do, say those that lived there when I left which was Henry Haygood, old Mr. Haygood and old Mr. Powell and sons and General Strawther and as it iswell known. Tell Seith Isaac Aldedge s to make a warrantee title to you or who may wish to purchase the land in this ---- say all my rights and claims of land lying on the waters of Little CederCreek which I purchased of the Miles, it being part of a plot of land granted to old Look Ralls more or less, that to say all my claim, in making this title,<br />Arledges will be perfectly safe and the purchaser also. And if they say they can't purchase it as<br />above stated they may be safe by you and them applying in Winsborogh at the office where y<br />they, I expect will find my land on record, both deed and plat, if I am not mistaken,  which will enable the purchaser to know the land. I had two hundred and six acres and three<br />quarters to best of my recollection.  I have bin thinking how there can be any dispute in the land next to Mr. Bowel's, if mine is it must be at the lower part of his plantation next to where William Broom lived. I bot a small plot of land of Wm. Miles I believe it was about an acre or two but forget whether I----------------on a branch below Bowels field by the branch is the line between me and Miles old place. I bot it to have excess to the water and give at the ---------- dollars per acre. The branch as I have already stated was the line for a small  -------- the la<br />maybe known it is a small piece of low ground on the west side of the branch and lies low and level, just below old Mr. Bowels plantation. I also had a small quantity (of land) on the  east side of the same branch and one of my corners is just below the piece of low ground above<br />named and on the east side of the branch next to Wm. Miles place which a Mr. Robinson<br />owned when I left that state.   The least I was offered for my land when I was on it was eleven<br />hundred dollars all down. This was offered by Mr. Powell &amp; Caleb Powell son of old Mr. Powell kno my land as well as I did and if yet alive can show the whole of it if he would.<br />Give my complement to Mr. Powell and tell him to be so good as to sh<br />my land to anyone that wants to purchase and in so doing he will much oblige one w<br />wishes him well. John tell Arledge to make a letter to all my right of land laying in<br />Fairfield District, more of less, and if they wish to purchase , the land being well ----- will make<br />no difference but they will still say they are afraid to purchase on the above named way</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;"> in </span><br />
<span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">order to get your land</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;"> for  nothing.   </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">If they will not purchase in the way above stated let it lie till they </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">are willing, and I would</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;"> not take less than a thousand dollars unless it was every dollar paid </span><br />
<span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">down,  then you may</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;"> take eight hundred all down and if they will not  give it for my claim  </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">more or less, let it stay</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;"> there til I come.  </span><br />

<span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">N.B.
