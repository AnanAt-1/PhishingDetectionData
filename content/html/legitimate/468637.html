PUBLISHERS PREFACE 

IN a prospectus of Canada and its Provinces, issued some years ago, 
the publishers printed an advance description of the plan and pur 
pose of the present volume, the twenty-third and last of the series. 
This description, being in the nature of a bid for subscribers, would 
presumably not be underdrawn. It would naturally paint the forthcoming 
volume in colours as vivid as possible. Now that the volume is published, 
and accomplishment has taken the place of promise, it may be interesting 
to see how the actual performance compares with the manifesto. 

This volume, the prospectus promises, will be of the highest possible 
importance. In the foregoing twenty-two volumes the associates have 
placed their facts and conclusions before the reader ; in this volume they 
will name and point to the sources from which these facts are drawn. The 
narratives will be followed chapter by chapter, arid documentary and other 
authorities will be cited. By this procedure of consigning citations for the 
most part to the final volume, the pages of the text are not burdened, and 
the majority of readers annoyed, by elaborate footnotes, while at the same 
time the student who wishes to know the sources will have them at his 
command. 

Then will follow a Chronological Conspectus of Canadian history, in 
which the reader may trace its development in condensed outline ; and, as 
a reminder that the development of Canada was after all but a phase in 
the onward march of the world s civilization, the chief contemporaneous 
events of European and American history will be placed in parallel columns. 
By the laws of association this will further serve as an aid to the memory 
and understanding, and will epitomize what is already made clear in the 
narratives, to wit, how events in Canada, in its early stages, were influenced 
and moulded by, and in some great matters were but the outgrowth of, 
contemporaneous events in Europe. 

But the crowning feature of this volume and of the work will be the 
General Index, wherein the facts contained in the twenty-two volumes will 
be collected in alphabetical order and rendered as instantly available as the 

vii 



viii CANADA AND ITS PROVINCES 

words in a dictionary. And this General Index will do more than merely 
indicate the volume and page where the information is to be found. It will 
itself give a great deal of useful and elementary information ; so that if the 
inquirer is only in search of a date or a brief description of a person or place, 
the Index will answer the question there and then. Nor will the entries be 
confined to proper names. Under such comprehensive headings as Im 
migration, Missions, Shipping, Fur Trade, Tariffs, etc., there will be collected 
references to the volumes and pages where these are discussed and cross 
references to closely allied topics. Thus any subject may be followed and 
studied in all its ramifications and aspects. 

The following pages will show that the twenty-third volume has been 
carried out substantially on the lines then indicated, and with no diminution 
of the diligent and accurate attention which was given to its predecessors. 
The General Index, the work of Mr D. S. Douglas, bears testimony to the 
patience and industry of its compiler in the pursuit of useful but obscure 
dates and facts, of which, besides the indexical references, it contains 
thousands. 

The publishers desire to extend their thanks to all who have assisted in 
the preparation and publication of Canada and its Provinces to the general 
editors, Dr Shortt and Dr Doughty, with whom their relations throughout 
have been most cordial, to the associate editors, to the contributors, to the 
subscribers, and particularly to the printers, Messrs T. &amp; A. Constable.

BOUNDARY DISPUTES AND TREATIES. By James 
White, (pp. 751-958.) 

From Fundy to Juan de Fuca. Moore a 
History and Digest of the International Arbitrations 
to which the United States has been a Party contains 
a remarkably full and fair history of the negotia 
tions, acts of state, etc., respecting the boundary 
controversies. Dr Moore, particularly, when 
assistant secretary of state of the United States, 
had excellent opportunity to consult the manu 
scripts, correspondence, and other papers filed 
in that department. Ganong, in his Boundaries 
of New Brunswick in Transactions of the Royal 
Society of Canada,, 1901, gives in much greater 
detail an account of the negotiations, acts of 
state, acts of jurisdiction, and cartographical 
history, and has brought together a mass of in 
formation not elsewhere available. While osten 
sibly confined to the boundary only so far as ifc 
affected New Brunswick, it covers the line from 
the Bay of Fundy to the Connecticut River and 
admirably supplements Moore s work. Winsor s 
Narrative and Critical History of America contains 
much excellent material, especially in the 
bibliographical notes. During 1838-45 blue 
books containing all diplomatic correspondence 
nnd reports respecting the boundary controversy 
were published by the British government. 
Many of these and other papers were published 
in British and Foreign State Papers and American 
State Papers, Foreign Relations. The British and 
American statements of case and second state 
ments to the King of the Netherlands are com 
plete ex parte expositions of their respective 
claims and of the historical aspect of the case. 
The work Remarks upon the disputed Points of 
Boundary under the fifth article of the Treaty of 
Ghent, supposed to have been written by Ward 
Chipman, Jr., is an able exposition of the British 
claim. 

In addition to the foregoing, Rives Corre 
spondence of Thomas Barclay is invaluable in 
studying the operations of the St Croix and 
Passamaquoddy Islands Commissions, and the 
commissions appointed under Article v of the 
Treaty of Ghent, particularly the negotiations 
respecting the Ashburton Treaty. Curtis s 
Life of Webster, The Works of Daniel Webster, 
The Private Correspondence of Daniel Webster, 
should be consulted. Gallatin s Right of the 
United States of America to the North-eastern 
Boundary Claimed by Them, and his Memoir on 
the North-eastern Boundary, are clear expositions 
of the American claim, bvit are, of course, biased. 
The best bibliography of the subject thus far 
published is the chronological list of Maps, 
Documents, Reports and other Papers in the 
New York Public Library relating to the North 
eastern Boundary Controversy (in Bulletin of 
the New York Public Library, iv, No. 6, December 
1900). 



THE DOMINION: POLITICAL EVOLUTION 



259 



British Diplomacy and Canada by Colonel 
Dudley A. Mills, in United Empire, ii, N.S. 10, 
October 1911, is an excellent and a very fair 
article, dealing fully with the map aspect of 
the question. In the University Magazine for 
October 1907, and December 1908, the writer 
defended, anonymously, Lord Ashburton and 
British diplomacy affecting the boundary. 

A blue book, Papers relative to the settlement of 
the Disputed Boundaries between the Provinces 
of Canada and New Brunswick, was issued in 1851. 
It contains all the correspondence between the 
Imperial and Provincial Governments respecting 
the differences, the reports of the arbitrators, etc. 
In his Boundaries of New Brunswick (Royal 
Society of Canada, 1901) W. F. Ganong has 
brought together much evidence not heretofore 
compiled, and has dealt with the subject ex 
haustively. Thos. Baillie s Northern Boundary 
between New Brunswick and Canada, and Supple 
mentary Report on the Boundary Line between 
Canada and New Brunswick, published as 
appendices to the Journals of the House of 
Assembly of New Brunswick, 1844 and 1845, 
respectively, contain his reports as Commissioner 
on the part of New Brunswick. 

Moore s History and Digest of the International 
Arbitrations to which the United States has been 
a Party is an admirable and fair exposition of the 
negotiations of the treaties and conventions 
affecting the settlement of the Oregon and San 
Juan boundaries. Greenhow s History of Oregon 
and California contains a very full historical 
statement of the controversy, but is marred by 
his prejudices and by his acceptance of the 
mythical discoveries of Juan de Fuca. Twiss s 
The Oregon Case examined in respect to Facts 
and the Law of Nations is an admirable judicial 
statement of the case from the British point of 
view. Falconer s The Oregon Question is also a 
fair presentation of the British view. Gallatin s 
Oregon Question is a very fair statement from 
the American point of view. Bancroft s Histories 
of the North-West Coast, of Oregon and of British 
Columbia, are voluminous and detailed, but 
not invariably accurate. Reeves s Diplomacy 
under Tyler and Polk is in every way an admirable 
exposition of diplomatic negotiations during the 
period 1841-49. For details of negotiations refer 
ence should be made to Correspondence relative 
. . . to the Oregon Territory, published as a 
British blue book ; British and Foreign State 
Papers, 1, 796-801; Iv, 743-790, 1211-1288; 
lix, 21-103 ; Ixii, 188 ; American State Papers, 
Foreign Relations, 1873 ; Benton s Thirty Years 
View ; J. Q. Adams s Memoirs ; Rush s Residence 
at the Court of London ; Curtis s Life of James 
Buchanan ; Richardson s Messages and Papers 
of the Presidents ; Tyler s Tylers ; Folk s Diary ; 
Papers relating to the Treaty of Washington ; 
Webster s Works. 

Except where otherwise indicated, the narra 
tive of the Commissioners under Articles vi and 
vii of the Treaty of Ghent is from the MS. reports 
of the commissions in the United States State 
Department, as summarized by Moore in his 
International Arbitrations. The correspondence 
respecting the settlement of the points of dis 
agreement between the Commissioners under 
Article vii is printed as a blue book, entitled 
Papers relative to the Special Mission of Lord 
Ashburton. The correspondence of David 
Thompson in Ontario Historical Society, vol. i, 
ia important, as the writer was surveyor for 
Great Britain on both commissions. 

Ontario Manitoba Boundary. The Joint 
Appendix of Documents and The Book of Arbi 



tration Documents contain, largely in duplicate, 
the numerous treaties, statutes, acts of state, 
official reports, etc., upon which counsel based 
the arguments presented to the Judicial Com 
mittee of the Privy Council. They constitute a 
veritable mine of information respecting the 
history of Canada. The Proceedings before 
Her Majesty s Imperial Privy Council on the , . . 
Westerly Boundary of the Province of Ontario 
contains a stenographic report of the case, and 
was published by the Government of Ontario. 
It contains voluminous notes, which must be 
used with care, as the bias of the annotator is 
apparent. Correspondence, Papers and Docu 
ments of dates from 1856 to 1882 inclusive, relating 
to the Northerly and Westerly Boundaries of the 
Province of Ontario, as the title indicates, is a 
compilation of correspondence between the 
Imperial and Canadian governments, between 
the Dominion and Ontario, etc. A Report on 
the Boundaries of the Province of Ontario, by 
David Mills, and An Investigation of the Unsettled 
Boundaries of Ontario, by Charles Lindsey, are 
excellent expositions of the Ontario view, but, 
as they were published in 1873, do not contain 
references to much valuable material discovered 
later. Sir Oliver Mowat, by C. R. W. Biggar, 
contains an account of the differences that led 
up to the Privy Council case. Numerous other 
works contain material germane to the case, but, 
as the essential portions have been extracted and 
republished in the Books of Documents, they are 
not enumerated here. Shortt and Doughty s 
Documents relating to the Constitutional History 
of Canada, 175 -91, is an exhaustive compendium 
of acts of state and correspondence relating 
thereto, from the capitulation of Quebec to the 
division of Quebec into Upper Canada and Lower 
Canada. The correspondence respecting the 
Constitutional Act of 1791 is given in the Report 
of the Canadian Archives, 1890. Other reports of 
the Archivist also contain much germane matter. 

Labrador -Canada Boundary. The publications 
enumerated as authorities for the Ontario- 
Manitoba Boundary should also be consulted in 
connection with the Labrador boundary. Gos 
ling s Labrador, its Discovery, Exploration and 
Development, is an excellent compendium of 
information respecting the Labrador coast, and 
contains a statement, from the Newfoundland 
point of view, respecting the boundary. The 
scope of Anspach s History of Newfoundland, 
Hatton and Harvey s Newfoundland, the oldest 
British Colony, Pedley s History of Newfoundland, 
and Prpuse s History of Newfoundland is indicated 
by their titles. The Ancient Right of the English 
Nation to the American Fishery, and The Begin 
ning, Progress and Conclusion of the Late War, 
contain much information respecting the fishing 
industry prior to the cession of Canada. 
A. P. Low in the Annual Report, Geological 
Survey of Canada, vol. viii, 1895, gives a concise 
statement of exploration in Ungava peninsula. 
M c Lean s Notes of a Twenty-five Years Service 
in the Hudson s Bay Territory contains an account 
of the establishment of the first posts and of the 
exploration of the interior. 

Alaska Boundary. The Alaska Boundary 
Papers, published by the British government as 
blue books, contain copies of all documents. 
They include the British Case and Appendix, 
British Counter Case and Appendix, British 
Arguments and Protocols, Argument, Award, etc., 
and four volumes of maps. The United States 
government published six volumes respecting the 
case. They included the United States Case and 
Appetidix the United States Counter Cote and

BIBLIOGRAPHY 



Appendix, a reprint of tho British documents and 
three volumes of maps. These publications 
contain an enormous mass of documents, and 
necessarily form the main source whence infor 
mation respecting the Alaska boundary differ 
ences must be drawn. In their preparation no 
effort was spared, and no possible source of 
information that appeared likely to furnish 
evidence was overlooked. 

The Fur Seal Arbitration papers contain many 
of the documents ot state that have a bearing on 
the dispute, but all that are germane are re 
printed in the Alaska Boundary Papers. 

T. W. Balch.in his The Alaska-Canadian Frontier 
and his later work The Alaska Frontier, deals 
with the map evidence in great detail, but their 
value is minimized by his prejudice. George 
Davidson s The Alaska Boundary is a statement 
from the United States point of view, but contains 
repetitions and numerous erroneous statements 
and deductions. Hon. John W. Foster in the 
National Geographic Magazine, No. 1899, and 
Dr John B. Moore in the North American Review, 
Oct. 1 899, made able but moderate statements of 
the contentions of the United States. 



David Glass in the Anglo-American Magazine, 
Dec. 1899, and an anonymous writer in the 
Edinburgh Review, April 1900, have contributed 
articles from the Canadian view-point. John S. 
Ewart s The Alaska Boundary is a strongly 
partisan exposition of the Canadian view, while 
D. A. M c Arthur in the University Magazine, 
Dec. 1907,goes to the otherextreme. F. C. Wade s 
Some Comments on the Alaskan Award, in the 
Canadian Magazine, is a severe criticism of the 
award by one of the British counsel. Mr Richard 
Jebb in the Empire Review, 1903, Sir T. H. Holdich 
in the Geographical Journal, Dec. 1903, Thomas 
Hodgins in The Alaska Tribunal and International 
Law, Hon. John W. Foster in the National 
Geographic Magazine, January 1904, and others, 
have contributed articles on this much discussed 
question. 

Jose Mine Bagot s George Canning and His 
Friends, Stapleton s George Canning, and Lano- 
Poole a The Life of Stratford Canning, contain 
much private correspondence and historical data 
that throw light upon many phases of the differ 
ences that were ended by the Treaty of 1825.
