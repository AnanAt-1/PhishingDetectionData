<p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;"><b>This web site was started in February 2009 to put the case for freeing schools from government control in terms of Sats, Ofsted, national curriculum and Whitehall micromanagement. </b></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;background-color: rgb(250, 200, 200);"><b>The stance is that while some government intervention in schools in the past has served a valuable purpose, it is now grossly counterproductive to the best interests of the young. See ABOLISH.&#xa0;(on navigation bar at the left). &#xa0;</b></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;background-color: rgb(250, 197, 197);"><b>The ambitions of the site are set out in the CHARTER. &#xa0;If you read nothing else, please read this!</b></span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;"><em>The word "free" in the website address is a verb not an adjective! This site is not about the present government's development of so called "free schools". &#xa0;</em></span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;">The website started as a critique of the policies of the Labour government in 2009. Since then the Coalition government elected in 2010, followed by the Conservative government elected in 2015, with Michael Gove as Secretary of State for Education and his successor Nicky Morgan, have made the control of our education system much tighter.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;"> Michael Gove radically changed the governance of schools (the academy programme), the national curriculum to make it more demanding, the syllabuses for GCSE and A-level studies to make them also more demanding, and the examinations for GCSE and A-level to raise the level needed for success - among other changes. &#xa0;See <span style="background-color: rgb(250, 200, 200);">POLITICS</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;">While some applaud these changes, seeing them as Government attempts to raise the standard of English education to serve the future needs of the economy, others (and particularly most teachers and academics, as well as many parents) recognise that these measures put increasing burdens on many schools, children and teachers and, in particular, will make it even harder for the children who are low achievers, to succeed. &#xa0;See <span style="background-color: rgb(250, 202, 202);">CHALLENGES</span>.&#xa0;</span></p><p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;">Everyone agrees that our schools should provide the best possible education for young people in terms both of their individual destinies and the future needs of the nation. See <span style="background-color: rgb(250, 202, 202);">EDUCATION.</span> &#xa0;But opinions differ on what is 'best' and how this should be achieved. Many politicians have a much more mechanistic view than parents and teachers and see only test and examination results as the measures of success of a school.&#xa0;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;">Educational decisions as to what is right for pupils should be determined by those who by training, experience and commitment are best qualified to decide – their teachers. See <span style="background-color: rgb(252, 202, 202);">PROPOSALS</span>. &#xa0;The best education comes when it arises from the classroom decisions of teachers, working collegially together, with parents, governors and local communities, and responding to a national framework of educational expectation Likewise the best accountability is based on the local knowledge of school governors, trained for this voluntary work and supported by national guidelines.</span></p><p><br/></p>
<ul><em>I, the author of this website, Michael Bassey, am an emeritus professor of Education, with many years of practical and research experience of education in England. Like many people today I grieve at what is happening in our educational institutions. Here is brought together the evidence of many distinguished professionals and senior academics who share these concerns and several of my essays. It is a call for action by teachers’ associations, parents, like-minded politicians, and all who care about the future of our children.</em></ul><br/>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;"> This site has steadily grown over the years since it began. My earlier concerns about SATs, Ofsted and the national curriculum are still valid as I hope are the pages devoted to a Political Charter, Accountability, Literacy test, a National Education Council, and Collegial Schools. &#xa0;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;">Recent entries have focussed on significant and worrying developments in the politics of education. See <span style="background-color: rgb(252, 202, 202);">POLITICS</span>.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 15px;">But perhaps the greatest concern should be that our politicians see schools as preparing for a future based on the economic conditions of today and fail to recognise that when today's school pupils are in the prime of their lives, the Earth will be warmer and in consequence extensive droughts and violent storms will play havoc across the world. &#xa0;<span style="background-color: rgb(250, 205, 205);">See FUTURES.</span> &#xa0;Schools need to be preparing their pupils for resilience, mutual support and living off the local land. &#xa0;See <span style="background-color: rgb(252, 199, 199);">EDUC[ATION]: GLOBAL WARMING</span></span></p>
