LE&amp;ENDS OF LE DETROIT

SECOND EDITION.

DEDICATION. 



To THE Loved Ones at "Tonnancoue," on the Banks of 

Lake Sainte Claike, ‚ñ†whbbb Undeb, the Gbateful 

Shade of a Majestic Willow I Have 

Listened to Many a Tale of 

the Mystic Past, 

These Legends Are Most Affectionately Dedicated. 

M. C. W. HAMLIN. 
Detroit, December, 1883. 



INTRODUCTION, 



The word "Legend" explains itself. Historical and romantic 
souYenirs hang like tattered drapery around the fair City of the 
Straits. Interest and curiosity have only to shake its venerable 
folds to scatter fragmentary histoiy and legendary lore. 

These weird tales, quaint customs and beautiful traditions have 
been handed down from generation to generation as sacred trusts. 
Originally brought from their cradle in Normandy, they are still 
tenderly cherished In the homes of the old families of Norman 
descent settled along "le Detroit." 

It has been my good fortune to hear many of them from loving, 
though aged lips of ancestors whose memories extend back, into 
the last century. 

It seems a befitting tribute to these noble and hardy pioneers 
that a descendant of theirs should gather and preserve in an 
imperishable form these mementoes they valued so highly. 

For my interest in the subject, and for the historical facts, in 
the writing of which I have tried to be strictly accurate, I am 
indebted to Charlevoix, La Hontan, Lambert, Margry's Collec 
tions, Parkman, Rameau, Lemoyne, Campbell, Sheldon, Lanman, 
and others. The Pontiac Manuscript, Morris' Diary, the Cass, 
Trowbridge and Roberts' Memoirs have also furnished material. 

For the data made use of in the articles on the "French Fami- 
lies " I am under much obligation to the records of Old Ste. Anne's 
Church, to the researches of my friend L' Abbe Tanguay, and to 
the brilliant essayist, poet and historian, Benjamin Suite, of 
Ottawa.

THE CROSS AND THE MANITOU. 




A^Iiegend of Belle Isle. 

OW frequently, as we sail on the 

beautiful Detroit River, or tread 

^^^^_^. the busy streets of the prosper- 

IalHHH^ ous city, does the mind go back 
‚ñ†H^^^^p to the remote past, wondering 
,^- %-,^';f^^ pM ^]2at kind of men were those 

brave explorers who first visited the wilds of 
these regions and gazed upon them in all their 
virgin loveliness. History has preserved to us 
the names of two of these. 

Francois Dollier de Casson had served as a cav- 
alry officer of renown under Turenne, and laid 
aside, in his ancestral halls in Brittany, his 
sword, sheathed in laurels, to take up the cross 
which was to lead him through the trackless for- 
ests of the new world- 



2 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Abbe Brehant de Galinee was a student whose 
knowledge of surveying and geography made 
him a valuable acquisition to the explorers of a 
new country, and to his graphic pen we are 
indebted for a detailed account of the visit of the 
missionary explorers to Detroit. 

They arrived in Montreal from France at the 
time when La Salle's great project for the explo- 
ration of the far West was the theme of every 
tongue. So thoroughly were all imbued with the 
spirit of adventure, the desire of gain and the 
glory of extending the arms and name of France, 
that even enlisted soldiers were allowed to apply 
for a discharge if they wished to accompany him. 

La Salle had just received the necessary per- 
mission and orders from De CourceUes, then Grov- 
ernor of Canada, to fit up his expedition for the 
exploration of that great river called by the Iro- 
quois, Ohio, by the French, Belle Riviere, really 
an arm of the Mississippi, of which such marvel- 
ous things were told by the Indians, who came 
each season to trade at Quebec and Montreal. 

Numerous tribes who had never been visited by 
the "black gown " were said to people its shores. 
So Dollier and Gralinee determined to carry to 
these nations the knowledge of the true God. 

On the 6th of July, 1669, the little fleet of seven 
birch bark canoes, each manned by three men, and 



Legends of Le Detroit. 3 

laden with the necessary merchandise to exchange 
with the Indians along their route for provisions, 
beaver skins and other furs, bade adieu to Mon- 
treal amid the joyous notes of the Te Deum and 
the sound of the arquebus. They reached Lake 
Frontenac (Ontario) August 2, and the 24th of 
September an Indian village called Timaouataoua, 
where they remained some time waiting for guides. 
There they overtook Louis Joliet, who was on his 
way to Lake Superior in search of a copper mine, 
wonderful specimens from which had been sent to 
Montreal by the Jesuit Allouez. The latter was 
then at Sault Ste. Marie, whither he had gone 
through the Ottawa River, Lake Simcoe, and with 
numerous portages into Georgian Bay. It was 
also Joliet' s object to discover a shorter route, and 
one which could obviate the necessity of so many 
tedious portages. Accident had revealed this route 
to La Salle. Being out hunting one day he found 
an Iroquois exhausted by sickness and travel 
worn. He tenderly cared for him, and the Indian 
repaid his kindness by sketching on a clean sheet 
of bark, with a piece of charcoal, the position of 
the lakes and the route to the Ohio and Missis- 
sippi. This crude chart proved a precious legacy 
to the energetic and intrepid La Salle. Unfortu- 
nately he was taken ill, and his malady was of so 
severe a nature that he was forced for the time 



4 ' ' Legends of Le Detroit. 

to give up his cherished project. But Dollier and 
De Galinee, urged by Joliet, determined to aban- 
don the expedition to the Ohio and Mississippi, 
and go in search of the tribes along the lakes. 
They bade adieu to Joliet and La Salle and started 
on their perilous journey, acompanied by seven 
men. They wintered at Long Point on the north- 
ern shore of Lake Erie. From the mildness of 
the climate when compared with that of Lower 
Canada, the quantity of its game, the purity of 
its waters, the abundance of its fruit, especially 
the grape from which they made sufficient wine 
to use for the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, they 
called it "The Terrestrial Paradise of Canada." 
It was in the early spring of 1670 that their 
canoes landed at Detroit. It was an enchanting 
scene, which unfolded like a coy maiden, its rare 
loveliness to the admiring eye of the European. 
He saw the fresh virgin forests clad in the vest- 
ments of spring, the broad sweeping river, with 
its graceful curves in whose limpid waters thou- 
sands of fish could be seen, along the banks teem- 
ing herds of bison, and droves of deer gazing with 
wondering eyes on the stranger. The air was per- 
fumed by woodland flowers which scattered their 
sweet incense to the music of the birds, whose 
gorgeous plumage almost rivalled the flowers in 
hue. Above all was present that grand solemn 



Legends of Le Detroit. 5 

silence only found in the heart of the forest, resting 
like a hushed benediction. After wandering about 
some time in this fair region, and with hearts over- 
flowing with emotions of love and gratitude to- 
wards Him who had led their footsteps here, they 
came upon an open clearing in the center of which 
arose a grassy mound crowned by a rude stone 
idol. It was a crude production of nature, created 
by her in a fit of abstraction and which the In- 
dians had attempted to convert into the semblance 
of a deity by touches of vermillion. Offerings of 
tobacco, skins of animals, and articles of food 
were scattered in reckless profusion at its feet. 
This, then, was the great Manitou, of whom their 
guides had spoken, who held in his hand the 
winds, and whose mighty voice was heard in the 
storm that swept over the lakes. He was held 
in great veneration, and as the Indian launched 
his frail bark on the treacherous waters of the 
lakes he would come^with his offering of propitia- 
tion to this wayside place of pilgrimage. The 
missionaries, indignant at this exhibition of idol- 
atry, broke the statue in a thousand pieces, and in 
its place erected a cross, at whose foot they afiixed 
the coat of arms of France with this 

inscription: 

In the year of grace 1670, Clement IX being seated in the chair 
of St. Peter, Louis XIV reigning in France, Monsieur de Cour-

celles being Grovernor of Kew France and Monsieur Talon being 
the Intendant of the King, two missionaries of the Seminary of 
Montreal, accompanied by seven Frenchmen, arrived at this place 
and are the first of all the European people who wintered on the 
land bordering on Lake Erie, which they took possession of in the 
name of their King, as a country unoccupied, and have affixed 
the arms of France at the foot of this cross.

Priest of the Diocese of Nantes, Brittany.

Deacon of the Diocese of Rennes, Brittany. 

Taking the largest fragment of the broken idol, 
the missionaries lashed two canoes together and 
towed it to the deepest part of the river so that 
it should be heard of no more. But the tradition 
says that after the fathers were far away, a band 
of Indians coming to offer their homage to the 
deity found only its mutilated remains. Each 
took a fragment which he placed in his canoe as a 
fetish, and it guided them to where the Spirit of 
the Manitou had taken refuge under the deep, 
sombre shadow of Belle Isle. He bade them 
bring every fragment of his broken image and to 
strew them on the banks of his abode. They 
obeyed his order, and behold ! each stone was 
converted into a rattlesnake, which should be as a 
sentinel to guard the sacredness of his domain 
from the profaning foot of the white man. To 
the answering call of those who came to his leafy 
retreat he would mockingly re-echo their words.

on the moonlit waters of the Detroit, amuse them- 
selves in awakening the angry spirit of the Indian 
god as they test the echoes of Belle Isle. 

Belle Isle has changed name four times. 

1. It was called Isle Ste. Claire (Charlevoix). 

2. Rattlesnake Island from the number of these serpents which 
infested it. 

3. Hog Island (Isle Aux Cochons), by the French from the 
number of these animals put there to destroy the snakes. 

4. Belle Isle, in 1845, after Miss Belle Cass, daughter of General 
Cass and afterward the wife of Baron Von Limburg. 



II 

THE BAPTISM OF LAKE SAINTE CLAIRE. 




A Legend of the Griffin's Voyage. 

URING the long winter 
months of 1678-9 there 
might have been witness- 
ed on the banks of the 
Niagara River, some five 
miles above the Falls and 
_ near the month of what 

is now known as Caynga Creek, an undertaking 
new and unheard of in that locality, and well 
calculated to excite the wonder and amazement 
of the savage denizens of the surrounding forests. 
It was the building of a ship by the daring 
band of French explorers under the Sieur de La 
Salle ‚Äî the first sailing vessel that ever navigated 
Lake Erie and the upper lakes, and the pioneer 
of the vast commerce that now plows these waters. 
Through the dreary winter the little band of 



Legends of Le Detroit. 9 

workmen toiled assiduously, though their food at 
times was only parched corn, and they had to 
depend to a great extent on the uncertain sup- 
plies of fish and game furnished by the Indians, 
while spikes, chains, anchors and even cannon had 
to be carried up the rocky steeps from the level of 
Lake Ontario. The undaunted energy and iron 
courage of their commander. La Salle, aided by 
the pious exhortations of the RecoU^t Chaplain, 
Louis Hennepin, bidding them to labor for the 
glory of God and the honor of France, made them 
indifferent to the taunts and jeers of the jealous 
Indians. Their imaginations were inflamed and 
their enthusiasm aroused by glorious pictures of 
the new discoveries to be made in the far West ; 
of the great honors and fortunes all were to 
acquire ; of the new trafiic that was to be opened 
in the hides of the wild cattle that roamed in 
countless numbers over the plains ; of the inex- 
haustible supply of ores they could draw from 
the rich mines of Mexico, and of the outlet for 
all this wealth which was to be found at the 
mouth of the great Mississippi. that La Salle was 
to open to the ships of France. 

The shadows of the summer of 1679 had deep- 
ened before the little brigantine of forty-five tons 
approached completion. The commander had 
decided to name her the ' ' Grifiin, ' ' in allusion to 



10 Legends of Le Detroit. 

the arms of tlie Comte de Frontenac, whose sup- 
porters were " Griffins." An expert wood carver 
from Rouen had carved for the ship' s bows a won- 
derful image of the fabled monster, half lion and 
half eagle, with ears erect, emblematic of strength, 
swiftness and wa-tchfulness. But among the more 
pious of the band the name was deemed an evil 
one, and their superstitious natures conjured up 
disasters to come, "For," they said, "a vessel con- 
structed for such an enterprise ought to be named 
after the Blessed Lady, or at least after one of 
the saints. ' ' La Salle laughed at such notions, and 
tried to impress on the minds of the Frenchmen 
and Indians that the Griffin was a powerful Man- 
itou, who would protect them from all harm, and 
guide them safely to their destination. 

At last aU was ready for the launch ‚Äî the crew 
were assembled and the notes of the " Te Deum " 
floated on the air. A bottle of brandy was broken 
over the bows of the vessel, and liberal pota- 
tions distributed among the Indians. A salute 
was fired from the seven guns ranged along the 
decks, and amidst the enthusiastic shouts of 
"vive le Roi," the vessel glided from her ways, 
and floated on the waters of the Niagara River. 
The indignation of the Indians who were watch- 
ing, and who had never dreamed it possible to 
launch her, knew no bounds. At last she was

beyond their power to destroy by fire, wMch they 
had several times attempted. La Salle, with a 
number of his men, had returned to the shore and 
noticing the chagrin of the savages, pointed to 
the flag with a GriflBn emblazoned thereon, 
proudly waving from the masthead, and taunt- 
ingly exclaimed : 

"Now you can see the eagle flying above the 
crows," alluding to the black-gowned Jesuits 
whom he deemed his enemies and what was worse, 
entirely too friendly with the Iroquois. 

On this the noted Prophet Metiomek could no 
longer contain himself, and exclaimed : ' ' Great 
Chief, you are too proud. You have shown con- 
tempt for the Great Spirit who rules all things, 
and you have set up an evil spirit on His throne. 
You seek the tribes of the west to trade with 
them and to destroy them with your cursed fire- 
water. You sneer at the ' black gowns ' Onontio 
sent us, who have taught us to worship the Great 
Spirit and till the ground. But Metiomek, the 
prophet of his race, bids you beware ; darkness, 
like a cloud, is ready to envelop you ‚Äî the Chris- 
tian Indian' s curse rests on you and on your great 
canoe. She will sink beneath the deep waters 
and your blood shall stain the hands of those in 
whom you trusted ! ' ' 

As Metiomek gave utterance to this prophecy 



12 Legends of Le Detroit. 

in" deep and impressive tones, amidst the most 
solemn silence, Fathers Hennepin and Zenoble 
looked serious, and the sailors ominously whis- 
pered to each other their apprehensions, but La 
Salle, with his usual exuberance of spirits, care- 
lessly laughed away the rebellious mutterings 
which fluttered like a light cloud over the assem- 
bly. 

On August 7, 1679, the great square sails of the 
brigantine were set, and La Salle, mounting the 
lofty stern, gave orders to take a course of west 
by south, and sailed away on the unknown waters. 

Despite the prophecy, the voyage was most 
prosperous, and favorable winds carried them 
twenty leagues the first night. . On the 8th they 
made forty-five leagues and passed a point which 
they named St. Francis (now Long Point). On 
the 9th they passed Point au Pelee ; and on the 
10th, the feast of St. Lawrence, they saw the Trois 
Soeurs (Three Sisters' Islands), standing like the 
three Parcse, guarding the terrestrial paradise of 
le Detroit. 

As they sailed by Grosse Isle and the adjacent 
island, their spirits were wonderfully exhilarated. 

"We found," says Father Hennepin in his 
journal, "the country on both sides of this beau- 
tiful strait, adorned with fine open plains. Any 
number of stags, deer, bear (by no means fierce, 



Legends of Le Detroit. 13 

and very good to eat), poules d'indes* in abun- 
dance, and all kinds of game. The vessel's 'guys 
were loaded and decked with the wild animals 
our French and Indian hunters shot and dressed. 
The islands on both shores of the straits are cov- 
ered with primeval forests, fruit trees, like wal- 
nuts, chestnuts, plum and apple trees, wild vines 
loaded with grapes, of which latter some were gath- 
ered, and a quantity of wine was made. The vast 
herds of deer surprised us all, and it appears to be 
the place of all others where the deer love to con- 
gregate." And so the pioneer ship sailed up "le 
Detroit," or the strait now called the Detroit Riv- 
er f and passed the site of the present great city. 
They noticed on shore the spot where ten years be- 
fore Dollier and Gallinee (who had visited these 
regions in a birch bark canoe) had broken in 
pieces the painted stone idol, worshiped as a 
Manitou by the Indians. They saw on the border 
of the forests the Indian village of "Teuscha 
Grondie," and, to impress the fleeing savages, 
gave them a grand salute from the guns ‚Äî but the 
boat glided too rapidly for them to hear the im- 
precations hurled after them by the Indians, and 
the winds kindly wafted them away from the

14 Legends of Le Detroit. 

European ears. "May the Manitou whom we 
worship," they shouted, "and Wis Kin, who 
guards the gates of the lakes, devour the evil 
pale face who comes among us with, his white 
winged bird vomiting forth tire, smoke and thun- 
der ; and may the Manitou whom the black gowns 
cast in the lake many moons ago so trouble the 
waters, that their canoe shall find no rest thereon 
and be drawn dowa to the home of the evil spirit 
at the bottom of the lake." Unconscious of the 
malediction evoked by the savage foes, the Griffin 
passed Belle Isle into a circular-shaped lake at 
the head of the river. 

The summer sun was setting and flooding the 
waters with its golden hues ‚Äî the soft sound of 
the vesper bell died away in sweet cadences. The 
little band of hardy explorers fell on their knees 
giving thanks to Heaven for their prosperous voy- 
age. On the lofty stern of the vessel was Rob- 
ert Cavalier de la Salle, future explorer of the 
Mississippi ; by his side Henri de Tonty his 
captain of brigade ; near by, his partners in the 
enterprise, the Sieur de Boirondet and the Sieur 
D' An tray, and also the notary Jacques La Meterie 
and Jean Michel the surgeon. Sixteen French 
voyageurs and a small number of Indians com- 
prised the crew. As they rose from their devo- 
tions Father Louis Hennepin addressed them a 



Legends of Le Detroit. 15 

short discourse and concluded by saying : "This 
is the feast of Ste. Claire, let us commemorate it 
by bestowing her name on this beautiful sheet of 
water. I hereby solemnly baptize it Lac Sainte 
Claire, by which it will be henceforth known." 
Then all pledged the newly christened lake in 
many a bumper of wine made from the Detroit 
River grapes. 

The Griffin's journey to Lake Michigan where 
La Salle left her in order to pursue his discoveries, 
his vain effort to find the mouth of the great river 
he had explored while on his second expedition 
from France, and the closing of his adventurous 
career by the murderous hands of his men are 
events which have illustrated many a glorious page 
of our history. The attempt of the vessel to return 
loaded with a precious cargo of furs is mentioned, 
but uncertainty throws its melancholy shadow 
over its subsequent fate and that of its daring- 
crew. But Indian tradition sees the angry Mani- 
tous of the water surround the ill-fated ship and 
drift her into unknown realms, and on bright 
moonlight nights they hear a full chorus of manly 
voices* chanting the evening hymn, and frequently 
the image of a phantom ship is seen in the clouds. 

* These voices are no myths. Science has examined into the 
cause and says they are produced by the beating of the waves on 
a peculiarly sonorous shingle. Along the northern coast of certain 



16 Legends of Le Dei/roit. 

islands in Lake Superior is a low cliff of compact, flne-grained 
limestone which clinks like steel under the hammer. When the 
wind blows from the northeast, the waves beating at the foot of 
the cliff dash the fragments of stone against each other, causing 
them to give forth peculiar sounds. It is an jEoliau harp of stone.

THE NUN OF STE. CLAIRE. 



A Iiegend of the "Coureur des Bois." 

ONG before Cadillac had founded our beau- 
I tiful city of Detroit, certain bold rovers 
^ called coureurs des bois had already pitched 
their tents on the shores of Lake Ste. Claire. 
Among them was Jean Parent, whose stern, silent 
face like a tomb seemed to hide the dust of dead 
and buried hopes. He had left beneath Canada' s 
skies the graves of wife, parents and kindred. One 
tender rootlet remained to try to win him back to 
life ‚Äî little Genevieve, his daughter, whom he had 
brought with him to Grosse Pointe, whose happy, 
sunny disposition caused Joy to reign in the full- 
ness of her grace. As the father gazed upon his 
growing child he would smile, as if some far- 
gone memory came back to surprise his heart. 



18 Legends of Le Detroit. 

An expression of gentleness would flash, on Ms 
face, and his voice would soften like the winds 
when the storm is o'er. Others soon found this 
wild forest flower and offered her their simple 
liomage. Shyly she turned away from them; the 
tremulous wings of her heart were still furled, 
and she waited only to fly from the world to rest 
‚Ä¢on the bosom of her Saviour. She was anxious to 
devote her life to the service of Grod, and had 
written some time previous to the opening of our 
story to her aunt, the superior of the Ursuline 
‚ñ†convent at Three Rivers, to be admitted as a nun 
in her community. 

Jaques Morand one day met Genevieve, and 
was charmed as if by a vision. He was one of 
the fifty men who had come with Duluth in 1680 
to found a fort near the present Fort Gratiot, to 
which they gave the name of Port St. Joseph. 
‚ñ†Genevieve tried by every gentle art to make him un- 
derstand that his efforts were in vain. Seeing him 
still persistent, and knowing that vanity plucks 
irom her quiver her barbed arrows only when 
rivalry enters the field, she told him the desire of 
her heart was to become a nun. This resolution 
'on her part only inflamed his wish to possess her 
‚ñ†either by fair or foul means. He appealed in his 
desperation for assistance to an old Indian witch 
who practiced her incantations in the darkest part 



Legends of Le Detroit. 19 

of the forest, untenanted save by the ghosts of 
gloom. On his promising to sell his soul to the 
devil she gave him the power to change himself 
into the form of a wolf or Loup Garou (wehr-wolf), 
so he might more easily carry away his victim. 

The postal system of those primitive days was 
not as perfect or expeditious as at present, so 
Genevieve had many long vigils to keep ere an 
answer would arrive. She spent most of her time 
in preparing herself for her new vocation by 
prayer and fasting. Some pious hands had raised, 
on the border of the forest, beneath an ancient 
oak whose acorn had been cradled ages before, an 
altar to Notre Dame de Bonsecour. Genevieve 
wished to erect one on the beach. So, assisted by 
her father, she formed one of the rocks cast there 
by some great Manitou, whereon she placed a 
statue of the Blessed Virgin. She frequently 
visited the forest shrine, but long were the hours 
spent at the one on the beach. The waves would 
lazily sing as they crept upon the shore, and the 
birds catching the refrain would chant it to the 
rustling leaves. It was but a note in the grand 
harmony of nature to which the girl's yearning 
soul responded in the same mystic key. Early in 
the springtime when the earth blossomed with 
new hopes, Genevieve sent forth her petition to 
Three Rivers. Late in the fall, when the waters

chased by the east wind had nestled at the foot of 
the rocky shrine, the answer came to Genevieve 
that her wish was granted. With a heart aglow 
with happiness, which lent buoyancy to her trip- 
ping feet as they crushed the autumn leaves, she 
visited the sylvan shrine of Bonsecour. This^ 
child of the wilderness poured forth her simple 
thanksgiving, borrowing unconscious pathos from 
the dead leaves, frost-bitten shrubs and bare trees, 
mute types of mortals' doom. 

As she prepared to go towards the beach her 
lover Jacques, in the form of a Loup Garou, with, 
gleaming eyes, sprang out into her path. But the 
cross which she held in her hand disconcerted 
him. Like a fawn Genevieve leaped aside and 
flew swifter than the wind toward the lake. The 
evil beast came bounding in hot pursuit. Gene- 
vieve finding her strength failing sought refuge in. 
the little grotto of rocks on the beach. She threw 
herself at the feet of the Virgin, imploring aid and 
protection. She felt the fiery breath of the brute 
and, with a despairing cry for mercy, fainted. 
The appeal was heard ; as the Loup Garou leaped 
on the rocks he was instantly transformed to 
stone. The passer-by to-day may see at Tonnan- 
cour* this old legend embodied in stone.

‚Ä¢wMch stood high in la belle France ‚Äî De Montigny, 
Le Gardenr, Le Moyne, Dagneanx Douville, De 
Tonty, Gfodfroy de Tonnancour, etc. The post of 
honor was occupied by Monsieur La Mothe Cad- 
illac, Sieur de Douaguet and Mont Desert. 

He had just returned from France, bringing 
with him from Count Pontchartrain, the Colonial 
Minister, a commission of Commandant, and the 
grant of a tract of land fifteen acres square, wher- 
ever on "le Detroit" he should see fit to locate a 
colony and build a fort. 

Whilst they are toasting Cadillac in many a 
bumper, let us turn for a brief review of the event- 
ful career of the founder of Detroit. 

Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, son of Jean and 
Jeanne Malenfant, first saw light at Toulouse in. 
1661. At the age of 16 he entered the service,, 
and became a Lieutenant at 21. He came to Que- 
bec with his regiment, in which were many of the- 
scions of noble houses. Here he met and weddedi 
the beautiful Marie Therese Q-uyon, the daughter 
of an influential and wealthy bourgeois. Shortly 
afterwards the stern decree of war compelled him 
to leave his bride. He was sent to Acadia, where 
his bravery won him distinction and a commission 
from the French Government to make a report of 
the condition of the English colonies at that epoch. 
Count Frontenac in 1694 complimented Cadillac as 



'24 Legends of Le Detroit. 

the most efficient and energetic officer at his dis- 
posal, by giving Mm the command of Fort Buade, 
Michillimackinac, a post he retained for five years. 
His treaties with the Indians displayed such thor- 
ough experience and ability that he was rewarded 
by the government with a concession of the Island 
of Mont Desert (now a watering place on the 
New England coast), also a grant of a tract on the 
main land near the River Pentagoet, called Doua- 
guet, from whence he took his titles. He had 
several times passed through "The Strait," 
(Detroit River) and noted with his quick eye, the 
wonderful advantages it possessed. As a mili- 
tary post it would be a barrier to the wily Iroquois; 
to the English a gate, shutting them off from 
commerce with the Indians of the far West, and 
to France, the center of the fur trade in this section 
of the country. His earnest representations on 
the desirability of establishing a post on " le De- 
troit," added to his renown as an able soldier, 
had gained the consent of the Colonial Minister to 
his daring scheme. 

Let us return to the festive dinner party, where 
the swiftly passing hours were enlivened by the 
sparkling repartees which flashed from lip to lip 
had the brilliant jeu d' esprit, which drew their 
inspiration from the rare, generous wine of the 
noted cellars of the castle. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 25 

Whilst merriment was at its height, a servant 
‚ñ†whispered something in the host's ear, and he, 
turning to the guests, said : ' ' Messieurs, an old 
I'ortune-teller craves to enter ; shall I bid her do 
so?" All were in that happy frame of mind 
eager for any diversion, and a full chorus of " Oui, 
Monsieur" was the response. One of the gen- 
tlemen proposed to change places so as to puzzle 
the old witch if she had heard anything from the 
iservants. The party had barely changed when 
the door opened and the figure of an old woman 
entered. 

So strange, so bizarre, was her appearance that 
a murmur of surprise greeted her. A woman of 
unusual height, a dark, swarthy complexion, rest- 
less, glittering eyes, ‚Äî strangely fashioned gar- 
ments yet in harmony with her face. Some one 
said' "What is your name ? " In a deep, sonorous 
voice, with a slight foreign accent, she answered, 
" They call me Mere Minique, La Sorciere." On 
her left shoulder was perched a black, meagre 
‚Ä¢cat. Half a dozen palms were stretched forth for 
her inspection ; one after another she read. When 
she hesitated the cat would lick her ear, and the 
more superstitious th(^ight it the devil giving 
information. Many were the lively sallies as she 
betrayed some marked peculiarity of the guest, 
.and whisperings of amazement, as at times her 



26 Legends of Le Detroit. 

knowledge seemed almost supernatural. At last 
she came to La Mothe Cadillac, who, naturally 
skeptical, said, "Ma bonne Mdre, see what you 
can tell for me of the future, I care not for the 
past." 

Earnestly scanning his bold, energetic face, she 
took a brazen basin, into which she poured from a. 
curiously carved silver vial, which she drew from 
her breast, a clear, heavy liquid like quicksilver,, 
and holding La Mothe Cadillac' s hand, gazed into- 
the basin. "Sieur," she said, '‚Ä¢ yours is a strange 
destiny. A dangerous journey you will sooa 
undertake ; you will found a great city which one 
day will have more inhabitants than New France 
now possesses ; many children will nestle around 
your fireside." She paused and Cadillac, thor- 
oughly interested, bade her continue. "Hon 
Chevalier, I wish you had not commanded me to 
go on, for dark clouds are arising and I see dimly 
your star. The policy you intend pursuing in. 
selling liquor to the savages, contrary to the ad- 
vice of the Jesuits will cause you much trouble, 
and be the cause of your ruin. In years to come 
your colony will be the scene of strife and blood- 
shed, the Indians will be treacherous, the hated 
Englisli will struggle for its possession, but under 
a new flag it will reach a height of prosperity 
which you never in your wildest dreams pictured. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 27 

You will bask in a sunnier climate, but France 
will claim your last sigh." 

"Shall my children inherit my possessions?" 
asked Cadillac, unconscioasly giving utterance to 
the secret desire of his heart. 

" Your future and theirs lie in your own 
hands, beware of undue ambition ; it will mar all 
your plans. Appease the Nain Rouge* (Red 
Dwarf). Beware of offending him. Should you 
be thus unfortunate not a vestige of your inherit- 
ance will be given to yoiir heirs. Your name will 
be scarcely known in the city you founded." 

All were deeply impressed by the prophecy of 
the sibyl, save him to whom it was addressed. 
Shortly afterwards the party separated and Cadil- 
lac amused his wife by giving ‚Ä¢ her a humorous 
account of the old prophetess, but, to his amaze- 
ment, she too, seemed to look upon the event as 
of grave import. 

On the following day La Mothe Cadillac bade 
farewell to Quebec and left with his expedition 
of fifty soldiers and fifty artisans and voyageurs. 
Alphonse de Tonty, a relative of the Guyons, was 
his captain ; Dugue and Charconale his lieuten-

traditions is described as most malignant, if offended, but capablfr

ants ; Jacob de Marsac, Sieur de L' Ommesprou 
Ms sergeant; Francois and Jean Fafard his in- 
terpreters ; Father Constantin del Halle, a Recol- 
l^t, and Father Vaillant, a Jesuit, the chaplains. 
Xia Mothe Cadillac was hot fond of the Jesuits, 
;as they were powerful and strongly opposed to the 
sale of brandy to the savages, this traffic being an 
immense source of revenue to the early colonists. 
The Jesuit was sent by the Governor at the solici- 
tation of the Superior of the Jesuits, and was 
nicknamed by La Mothe Cadillac as "Monsieur 
de Trop." 

Cadillac wished to go by way of Lake Erie, but 
the Governor decreed otherwise. They left the 
Lachine Rapids the 5th of June, the trees were 
just budding and game and fish furnished an 
abundance of food. In July they arrived at Georg- 
ian Bay, via the Grand River of the Ottawas, and 
coasting down the eastern shore of Lake Huron 
they reached, on the 20th, the river Ste. Claire and 
the old Fort St. Joseph, at the foot of Lake Huron 
abandoned by Duluth thirteen years before. 

On the 24th of July, 1701, the head of the ex- 
pedition rounded Belle Isle and soon landed at 
a little cove at the foot of the present Griswold 
street. The Ottawas and Hurons, whose villages 
Tvere near, rushed down to welcome them, as did 
.also a few French "coureursdes bois," who lived 



Legends of Le Detroit. 29' 

here. Two of their names are still preserved \ 
Pierre Roy and Francois Pelletier. 

On the following day, with great ceremony, 
pickets for a new fort on the site of an old stock- 
ade were erected and a store house built on the 
foundation of an abandoned one, previously con- 
structed by the coureurs des bois for their winter 
supplies. 

A salute was given from the guns brought for 
the new fort, which Cadillac christened Fort 
Pontchar train.* On the 26th, Ste. Anne's day, 
with clerical ceremony, the foundation of the first 
church west of the AUeghanies was laid. Soon 
the stockade, which enclosed about an acre,t was 
finished, and the streets of Ste. Anne and St. 
Louis laid out and lined with the barracks for 
the troops and with houses constructed of hewn 
logs. Detroit was founded, and its prospects for 
a successful colony bright. 

The fortune-teller' s prediction, or at least part of 
it, was verified. 

* Royal sanction for this name was received by Cadillac a year 
later, July, 1702.

THE MAY POLE. 



A Legend of "Faith and Homag'e." 

SIX years had passed since the founding of De- 
troit. The frontier settlement began to as- 
sume a civilized aspect, and everywhere the 
touch of woman's hand had left its impress of 
comfort and refinement in the rude pioneer homes, 
which already extended along the Cote du Nord 
Est to La Rividre Parent (Bloody Run). 

The undaunted energy of Cadillac was rewarded 
by a yearly increase of settlers, and the records 
of Ste. Anne's Church, the most accurate and 
authentic census of those early days, show from 
1704 to 1707 an annual birth rate of fourteen. 

La Mothe Cadillac made his first grant of land 
to his interpreter, Fafard, on the 10th of March, 
1707. It was of a tract adjoining his domains, stip- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 31 

Tilating as usual for all his feudal rights, includ- 
ing the acknowledgment of faith, homage, and 
the planting of a May pole each year. 

There was great commotion in the little colony 
on that bright May morning in 1707. The very 
atmosphere seemed pregnant with excitement, for 
so does a gala day drape itself around everything, 
clothe all in its vague fancies, and unconsciously 
communicate to us more or less of its color. We 
wear its cockade and favor in our dress and 
humor. 

In front of the Seigneur de Cadillac's manor a 
great crowd had assembled, and from the eager 
expectancy written on every face, it was evident 
that some unusual event of interest was to take 
place. Slowly the form of Monsieur Fafard, the 
interpreter, was seen approaching with a stately, 
dignified step, each movement measured by the 
importance of the act of which he was to play 
the part of chief actor. The French understand 
perfectly that delicate art of investing even a tri- 
fling circumstance with an entourage of interest 
and display which gratifies their national vanity 
and love of glory. 

Monsieur Fafard knocked at the Seigneur Cad- 
illac's door, which was opened by the major domo. 
He inquired for Monsieur la Mothe Cadillac, who 
immediately stepped forth arrayed in his blue 



32 Legends of Le Detroit. 

uniform and cavalier hat with white phimes. 
Monsieur Fafard uncovered his head and falling^ 
on his knees rendered fealty in the following- 
manner : ' ' Monsieur du Detroit, Monsieur du 
Detroit, Monsieur du Detroit, I bring you faith 
and homage which I am bound to pay you on 
account of my fief of De Lorme, which I hold as 
a man of faith, of your Seigniory of Detroit, de- 
claring that I offer to pay my seignorial and feudal 
dues in their season, and demanding of you to ac- 
cept me in faith and homage as aforesaid." As 
he saluted la Mothe and turned away, Francois 
Bosseron and others who had been granted fiefs 
offered their homage in turn. 

Cadillac's house stood on the line of the pres- 
ent Jefferson Aveniie before it had been sloped 
down to the Chemin du Rond.* A spacious "gal- 
lerie' ' adorned the front of the manor overlooking 
the smooth cut lawn and majestic river. A hole 
had been dug in the centre of the lawn, and a tall, 
stately pole lay ready for raising. The branches- 
had been trimmed off, except a little clump at the 
top called "the bouquet." And to this had been 
nailed a parti-colored pole, from which the royal 
flag with the fair Fleur de Lis of France floated. 
Smooth and white was the pole and to its sides 

*Near the old Campau homestead. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 33 

blocks were nailed to allow a person to ascend. 
The firing of a gun was the signal to begin the 
ceremony. The Seigneur Cadillac had seated him- 
self on the "gallerie," surrounded by his wife, 
children and officers. ' A delegation from the hab- 
itants approached and bowing low asked him per- 
mission to plant the May pole in front of his house. 
The request was graciously acceded to and Father 
Deniau knelt and offered up a prayer that the 
festivities might pass without accident. The pole 
impelled by strong, sinewy arms slowly rose, while 
the voyageurs broke out in their wild and inspired 
song, "Vive la Canadienne et ses jolis yeux

The Seigneur de la Mothe Cadillac then ad- 
vanced hat in hand and smilingly accepted the 
pole, and asked all to join him in watering it that 
it might flourish. A cask of eau de me was tapped ; 
cups and flasks of every design and shape were 
passed around, and Cadillac raised his silver gob- 
let and pledged the King and the health of all 
present. An agile youth ascended the pole and

Comte.

shouted, "Vive le Roi, Yive le Seigneur Cadillac 
du Detroit ! " Then all caught the refrain : 

"‚ñ†Grand Dieu sauve le Roi, 
Grand Dieu venge le Hoi, 

Vive le Roi ! 
Que toujours glorieus, 
Louis Victorieux, 
Voye ses ennemis, 

Toujours soumis, 
Vive le Roi!"* 

The air was filled with cheers, the drums rolled, 
the trumpets sounded, and the guns completed 
the crescendo of acclamations. The pole was 
then ready to be blackened. This was done by 
‚Ç¨adillac taking a gun loaded with powder only, 
and firing at the pole. Then Madame and Antoine, 
Jr., a cadet of fifteen, took their turn, followed 
by the members of the family and oflScers, and 
finally each of the habitants until the clean pole 
was blackened its whole length. It was usually 
left standing several months, to remove it being 
‚ñ†considered unlucky. Tables were spread under 
the shade of the trees, and refreshments in abun- 
dance served to all. 

Then followed " La dance ronde" on the green 
sward. Cadillac gazed musingly on the pretty 
sceine before him. The picturesque dress of the

Hanover. It -was sung by the girls of Saint Cyr before Louis,

habitants and voyageurs, clad in their blue tunics 
and elk skin trousers, (whose seams were adorned 
with yellow fringe,) their buckskin moccasins 
ornamented with beads, their scarlet sashes, in 
which were kept the hunting knife in its silver 
case, blended with the soldiers' dress of blue, with 
its white facing. The officers wore gay uni- 
forms and cavalier hats, with the showy 'ostrich 
feather, their hair hanging in long powdered 
queues tied with ribbon. The ladies, in their 
coquettish costumes, dashed with bright ribbons, 
resembled birds of paradise as they swayed to 
the graceful movements of the dance. Each lady' s 
head was surmounted with a gay " fontange " or 
top-knot. It was a gay, light-hearted community, 
with few taxes to pay, simple tastes to gratify, 
friendly with the neighboring Indians. Peace, 
contentment and quiet happiness seemed to reign 
over this little Arcadia. 

So thought Cadillac as at twilight, after the 
people had dispersed, he strolled with his wife in 
the King's Garden.* Human nature grows more 
communicative at this hour, thoughts which find 
no utterance in the broad light of day now glide 
forth from the heart. He told her that his dreams

of ambition were about to be realized, notwith,- 
standing the obstacles of his enemies. His colony 
was prosperous and his children would inherit a 
princely portion ; that his name would become 
historic and illustrious. Thus were they talking: 
when two weary revellers homeward bound passed 
so near them that fragments of their conversation 
feU on their ears. "Yes," said Jean Baptiste, 
"our Seigneur and the Dos Blanc * carry them- 
selves very high, with their silver plate and fine- 
clothing, whilst we poor habitants must pay 
double for everything, even our petit coup ' d eau 
de vie ; ' ' expressing a little of the communistic- 
sentiments of the present time. 

"Things cannot run very long thus," answered 
his companion. ' ' My wife saw a few days ago. 
'le petit homme Rouge' and ‚Äî ‚Ä¢" The rest was- 
lost as the speakers disappeared. Cadillac' s wife 
grasped, her husband's hand convulsively and 
said : ' ' Did you not hear \ ' Le petit homme- 
Rouge' is the dreaded 'Nain Rouge. ' "" 

" What of that ? " said CadUlac. 

" 'Beware of the Nain Rouge' was what that 



* Dos Blanc. Literally "White backs.'' The officers powdered 
their wigs, and the powder falling on their coats whitened the 
backs. Many of the habitants encased their qpeues in eelskia to- 
prevent the powder from ruining their dress.

proplietess told you ; when he should come mis- 
fortune was nigh." 

"Bah!" laughed Cadillac, "have you not for- 
gotten that nonsense of a silly old fortune-teller? 
Let us return home." 

Annoyed himself at the remembrance, and 
doubly so at his wife for unconsciously giving 
utterance to his vague uneasiness, they proceeded 
in silence. 

Suddenly across .their path, trotting along the 
beach, advanced the uncouth figure of a dwarf, 
very red in the face, with a bright, glistening eye ; 
instead of burning it froze, instead of possessing 
depth emitted a cold gleam like the reflection from 
:a polished surface, bewildering and dazzling all 
who came within its focus. A grinning mouth 
displaying sharp, pointed teeth, completed this 
strange face. 

"It is the Nain Rouge," whispered Cadillac's 
wife. 

Before she had time to say more, Cadillac's ill- 
nature had vented itself in striking the object 
with a cane he held in his hand, saying : 

"Get out of my way, you red imp !" 

A fiendish, mocking laugh pierced the still 
night air as the monster vanished. 

' 'You have offended him, ' ' said Madame. ' 'Your 
impetuosity will bring you 'and yours to ruin. 



38 Legends of Le Detroit. 

You were told to coax him ‚Äî -to beware of annoying: 
this demon ‚Äî and in your ungovernable temper you 
do just otherwise. Misfortune will soon be our 
portion." 

Cadillac shortly afterward visited Montreal^ 
was arrested through the intrigues of his enemies^ 
and was compelled to sell his seigniory in Detroit 
to pay for his trial. He was removed to Louisiana 
as Governor, but died at Castle Sarasin, in France. 
His children never inherited an acre of his vast 
estates. His colony for the next hundred years^ 
was the scene of strife, war and massacre. Its 
flag changed five times ; under that of the Repub- 
lic it reached that glorious prosperity which the 
fortune-teller had predicted. 

The Nain Rouge in the mystic past was consid- 
ered the banshee or "Demon of the City of the 
Straits," and whenever he appeared it was a sure 
sign of impending evil. The night before Dal- 
zell's ill-fated attack at Bloody Run, he was seen 
running along the shore. And in 1805, when the 
city was destroyed by fire, many an old habitant 
thought that they caught a glimpse of his mali- 
cious face as he darted through the burning build- 
ings. On a foggy morning before Hull' s cowardly 
surrender of Detroit, he was seen ; but since then 
he has never reappeared, having, it is to be hoped, 
accomplished his mission. But the tradition still 



Legends of Le Detroit. 39 

lingers among the old habitants that should mis- 
fortune ever threaten the bonnie City of the Straits, 
the Nain Rouge will again appear to give the sig- 
nal of vrarning.

EJSTEATH tlie sunny skies of 
Italy, on tlie banks of the Arno,

Beautiful, " the guide points to 
an old monastery as the last 
relic of an order now almost extinct, the Recollets. 
With the deep feeling of interest which the slight- 
est relation with home awakens in a foreign 
land, we turn with kindling eyes and tender 
emotions surging through our hearts, to gaze rev- 
erently upon the building as on the face of an 
aged friend. For from beneath that massive 
archway came forth a brave, courageous band, 
who first left the impress of their footsteps on the 



Legends of Le Detroit. 41 

virgin soil of our fair city. Within those gloomy- 
walls they were trained by an austere and ascetic 
rale to meet those dangers and hardships insepa- 
rable from the explorations of anew country; and 
their heroic and almost supernatural eflEorts to 
convert the savage, have challenged the admira- 
tion of every age. Wherever the lily of France 
unfurled itself to the new breezes of America, the 
cross became its flag-staff, and the rude birchen 
chapel the mile-stone to record the missionaries' 
progress. 

In 1670 there resided in Florence an ancient 
family of wealth and distinction named Del Halle. 
Its heir and last representative belonged to the 
" jeunesse doree " of the day. He blended in his 
character that happy union of manly qualities 
which satisfied his haughty father's ambition, 
with those gentler accomplishments which made 
him the idol of his mothers heart. Early be- 
trothed to Adelina, the daughter of a princely 
house, to whom he was endeared by the sweetest 
links of childhood, their future promised to be as 
unclouded as the sunny sky of their native land. 
But, like the simoon which blackens and lays low 
aU over which it passes, the fell destroyer, "the 
black death" of the fourteenth century, again 
visited Florence, converting its palaces into char- 
nel houses, its laughter into wails, its music into 



42 Legends of Le Detroit. 

funeral dirges, leaving mourning and 'desolation 
hanging like a pall over the doomed city. 

One morning young Del Halle awoke to find no 
response to his faint call of father or mother^ no 
anxious, loving bride to catch the first dawn of 
returning consciousness. All had been swept 
away by the dreadful scourge, and he sat alone in 
his deserted halls, with memory and grief as his^ 
companions. The recollections of other days- 
with their bright pictures and melodies would 
come surging up with their mocking delusions. 
But ever and anon the holy face of an aged Recol- 
16t monk, at whose knee he had listened in early 
boyhood to the marvelous tales of the mission- 
aries of his order in the wilds of Canada, came 
like refreshing dew to cool his parched soul. 
A few weeks afterward he knocked for admit- 
tance at the monastery gate, willingly leaving 
behind the pleasures, the refinements, and the 
brilliant prospects so alluring to his years. He- 
exchanged the costly robes of the Florentine noble 
for the serge ; the sword for the breviary, and 
thus at the early age of twenty did the heir of the 
Del Halle become the humble Frere Constantin. 
Ten years later he was sent to France and from 
thence sailed to Montreal. It was in Montreal he 
met La Mothe Cadillac, a young French ofiicer, 
who vpas enthusiastic over a scheme of founding; 



Legends of Le Detroit. 43- 

a colony in the beautiful " Detroit du Lac Erie." 
The frank, easy manners of the officer, his keen 
intellect and his undaunted energy won the affec- 
tion of Frere Constantin, who entered with all 
ardor into the project of his friend. 

Owing to various political causes, the necessary 
permission and grants were slow in coming, but 
Cadillac's patience and perseverance were at last 
rewarded, and on the 5th of June, 1701, ‚ñ†\krith his. 
little band of fifty soldiers and fifty Canadians, 
with M. de Tonty as captain, Messrs. Dugue and 
de Chacornacle as lieutenants, he sailed from Mon- 
treal. Frere Constantin Del Halle accompanied the 
troops as chaplain, with Father Vaillant, a Jesuit, 
who was going as missionary to the different tribes. 
They arrived at Detroit July 24, 1701. Shortly 
afterwards the tinkling sound of the bell sum- 
moned the garrison to early mass and told that 
the chaplain had already begun his work. By the 
simplicity of his manners, the uniform sweetness 
of his disposition and his austere life, he gained 
the respect and affection of all. The deep shade 
of melancholy which tinged his features told the 
unfortunate that here was one who had known 
sorrow, and who would lend a sympathetic ear to 
the tale of their misfortunes and give the balm of 
comforting words to their bruised hearts. The 
little children drawn by the sympathetic instincts

of childhood would nestle .their heads against him 
and shyly put their tiny hands in that of " le bon 
Prere." 

Among the officers who were stationed at Fort 
Pontchartrain (as Cadillac had called his post, in 
honor of Jerome Phelyppeaux, Count Pontchar- 
train), was Etienne Yeron de Grandmesnil, keeper 
of the King's storehouse, who had become enam- 
ored with the dusky daughter of a Pottawatomie 
chief. This tribe, though friendly to the French, 
had resisted every effort to convert them to Chris- 
tianity. A prophet of their nation had foretold 
that as soon as they should desert their Manitou 
for that of the white man, their lands would pass 
away, their wigwams be burnt, and their tribe 
scattered. Young de Veron, iinable to overcome 
the obstinate prejudice of the old chief against 
Christianity, in the ardor of youth and passion, 
thought of allying himself to his Indian sweet- 
heart by the Indian rights and betaking himself 
to the lodges of the Pottawatomies. Frere Con- 
stantin remonstrated with de Yeron, who belonged 
to a noble family of Quebec, spoke of his father's 
hopes in him, his mother's love and of his duty 
as a soldier of France, told him to be patient, 
and the old chief would relent ; but threatened, 
if he persisted, that he should incur the severest 
penalty of the church ‚Äî excommunication. The

Indian maiden, worried by her father' s command 
to wed a warrior of her nation, and stung by the- 
apparent indifference of her lover, determined to 
put an end to her sorrow. Stealing away from her 
wigwam one stormy night under the kindly pro- 
tection of the darkness, she plunged into the tur- 
bulent waters. An agonizing cry brought succour- 
to the shores but she sank away before aid could 
reach her and a few days later her body was found 
floating in the Detroit. 

Shortly after Frdre Constantin was called tem- 
porarily away to another mission, and as days, 
passed and he still lingered, although the coureurs 
des bois had reported his leaving the mission, 
before them, Cadillac became uneasy; for time and 
the constant dangers and perils of those days. 
only served to cement the links of a friendship so 
happily begun years before in Montreal. It was^ 
noticed that a cloud rested on Cadillac's brow 
which the tender solicitation of his wife, the fair 
Therese Guyon, could not chase away nor the 
infantile graces of his favorite child, the little 
Therese, the pet of the colony ‚Äî as she was the 
first born and baptized in the fort ‚Äî soothe by her 
caresses. Strange stories were whispered by the 
Indians to the soldiers, of a haunted spot on the 
Savoyard.* 

* A beautiful stream -which meandered above the present Russell 



46 Legends of Le Detroit. 

These reaching Cadillac's ear seemed to lend a 
color to his own sad forebodings of the fate of 
his friend. It was said that at dawn every morn- 
ing faint sounds of a bell might be heard, and 
different parts of the mass distinctly made out, 
and that a voice, as mournfully sweet as if it had 
its source in unshed tears, would float on the mid- 
night air chanting in Latin the Miserere. 

It was noticed that for some time Churlioa, the 
Pottawatomie chief, sat before his wigwam, occa- 
sionally muttering to himself, then drawing his 
blanket over his head would vanish for days in 
the forest. The medicine men sadly shook their 
heads, and pointed significantly to their fore- 
heads, saying the great Churlioa was bewitched. 

One evening an Indian presented himself at the 
gate of the fort and asked to see Cadillac. Ad- 
mitted to the Commandant's presence, he stated 
"that Churlioa had sent for the chief of the white 
TQen ; that when the young men returned from 
hunting that day they had found their great 
‚ñ†chief lying as one dead in the forest. Cadillac 
followed his -guide and soon stood by the dying 
warrior. He confessed having murdered Frere

death. He feared to take his scalp as it might

Ibetray him, and bring upon his tribe the vengeance 
' -of the French. He had known no peace since, 
lor the spirit of the priest seemed to haunt him in 
the moaning reeds. He heard his voice in the 
rustling leaves, and a strange fascination led his 
footsteps to the spot where the murder occurred. 
That the previous night he wandered there, the 
bright moon illuminated the forest and he could 
see as in the daylight, that the tall form of his 
victim stood in his path, and vidth outstretched 
arms besought him to have his bones lie in conse- 
crated ground‚Äî that until then the Indian would 
be haunted ‚Äî and with the sound of rushing waters 
in his ears the chief knew no more until he awoke 
in his wigwam and sent for Cadillac. 

The sad news was soon known in the colony, 
and Cadillac went to the spot indicated by the 
Indian. In the hollow of a tree, covered by leaves, 
they found the body of Frere Constantin. They 
placed it on a litter formed of the fragrant boughs 
of the spruce. Father de la Marche came to meet 
the body, which was borne by the oiRcers of the 
fort followed by the weeping people. Tenderly 
they laid it to rest in the consecrated earth as he 
had so earnestly desired. The last of a princely 
race rested in the forest of a new world. No 
stately mausoleum received his remains ; no pom- 
pous tablet told his lineage, or recorded his deeds.

The pines chanted his requiem, the tears of his 
flock were his epitaph, and the innocent hands of 
children strewed his grave with the wild flowers 
of the woods. 

In 1724, when the new Ste. Anne's Church was 
built, Alphonse de Tonty had the remains removed 
from the humble grave and placed in a vault 
which he had himself prepared beneath the altar, 
in the presence of all the people of the colony, to 
whom Father Bonaventure related the edifying 
life and death of the saintly priest, Frere Con- 
stantin del Halle.

Barbe Loisel sat alone with her little children 
in the rude settler's cabin on the banks of the

In the huge fireplace the flames danced merrily 
above the hickory logs, and the iron crane held 
the steaming pot-au-f eu. She was waiting for her 
husband's return from a distant expedition, 
whither he had been sent by de la Forest, Com- 
mandant of Fort Pontchartrain. It was Francois 
Fafard, dit Delorme, a noted interpreter. Theirs 
had been among the first marriages recorded in 
the register of the little church of Ste. Anne, and

still to be seen to-day. She had been the widow 
of Francois Gantier, Sieur de la Yallee Ranee, a 
French officer of high rank, who was killed in 
1710. Her youth, beauty and unfortunate condi- 
tion appealed to the manly heart of Delorme, who 
won her, and his strong arm shielded her from 
many dangers inseparable from a frontier life. 
To-night he had promised to return, .and she 
knew it could only be an insurmountable obstacle 
that could cause him to break his word. 

The blood-curdling howliug of wolves were dole- 
ful symphonies to ears strained to catch the first 
sound of familiar footsteps. At each weird note 
of the storm the little ones would nestle closer 
to the mother, drawing in security even from the 
touch of her garment such is the wonderful 
witchery of maternal affection. To quiet them 
and to lull the beating of her own anxious heart, 
she told them many Indian legends of the past. 

Of the great rivalry which once existed between 
the east and west wind. How the east wind, being 
Tictorious, prevailed for seven years, until the

such a height as to threaten inundation to the 
lodges and corn-fields of the tribes living on the 
banks, when the Great Spirit, seeing the misery 
of his children, and listening to their petitions, 
recalled the west wind from behind the moun- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 51 

tains whither it had been driven, and caused it 
to reign for seven years, thus forcing back the 
waters into their original channel. Many to-day 
notice the fact relative to the waters of the De- 
troit, and we find a memorandum of it in the jour- 
nal of Capt. Morris, of her Majesty's Eighteenth 
Infantry, who visited Detroit in 1764: ' ' That the 
waters of these lakes rise for seven years and fall 
for seven years ; in fact there is a seven years' 
tide ; and Gen. Bradstreet whilst encamped on 
the shores of Lake Erie, lost a great many boats 
and a large quantity of provisions and baggage 
by a : sudden washing of the waves against the 
fihore. What struck him as a strange phenome- 
non was that during the heaviest part of these 
swells no wind was perceptible, a fact he fully 
illustrated by placing soldiers along the banks 
with lighted candles, not one going out." * 

Then the good Barbe told them how severely 
the Great Manitou had punished disobedient 
children in days gone by. He had condemned 
them to flit about in a circumscribed space as 

*CoDsiderable doubt still exists as to the cause of the pei'iodic

blocked up the channel of the Ste. Claire River that Lake Ste.

had receded from the shore of Grosse Pointe nearly four miles. 
A similar freak of nature occurred in 1818. In winter the ice

little winged insects and guarded by a stern old 
Manitou. That one day a little brother of these 
naughty children had resolved to go in search of 
them. He started out bravely, walked all day, 
and towards night becoming exhausted, fell 
asleep beneath the leaves of the aspen tree. The 
spirit which is believed to inhabit it appeared to 
him and said : "Follow me and I will lead you to 
your brothers and sisters." He awoke and found 
himself going up higher and higher until he 
reached cloud land. His guide then gave him a 
bow with a quiver full of arrows, and said : 
"Always shoot towards the north ; keep one 
arrow to return with ; as soon as you reach water 
throw some on your brothers and sisters and they 
will return to their natural shape, and the evil 
spirit will never be able to molest them again." 
At each flight of a magic arrow a long, solitary 
streak of lightning appeared like a golden rent in 
the sky, through which the child could catch 
glimpses of the beauties hidden there. At last 
he saw where his brothers and sisters were confined 
and, aiming straight, soon opened the door to the 
imprisoned ones, who came through the golden 
crevice in the form of myriads of little insects- 
which flitted around him joyfully. During his 
delight he forgot the injunction of the fairy and 
sent his arrow away from the north, when sud- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 53 

denly a distant sound like thunder was heard and 
a fearful voice full of majesty and passion, said : 
" Presumptuous one, for having dared to invade 
the kingdom of the Manitou, you shall be made 
an example to deter others from such profane 
ambition." He was turned into the heat light- 
ning which is always seen on the northern skies 
on summer evenings. And the little insects, par- 
alyzed by that dreadful voice, perished in one 
night. How^ frequently on a summer's night we 
see countless numbers of these insects, the famil- 
iar "June flies" of the Detroit, hanging to the 
lamp-posts, apparently dazed from some unknown 
cause, and strewing the sidewalks to be crushed 
under foot. The Indian mother never whips her 
child, but always throws cold water in its face, 
thus punishing it and preventing its being changed 
into an insect or bug. 

In this way the pioneer' s wife was wont to hush 
her little ones to sleep ; the Indian legends were 
their lullabys. It was growing late, and still De- 
lorme returned not. Barbe shaded her eyes and 
gazed out into the night, ‚Äî darkness everywhere ; 
the voices of the storm were whispering their 
doleful cadences, but it seemed as if above these 
she heard the loved one calling her. Thinking 
her imagination had been overwrought by the sto- 
ries she had related, she closed the door. But an

impulse stronger than herself bade her open it 
again and distinctly came the words, in a mourn- 
fully sweet voice, "Barbe, come to my assist- 
ance!" (Barbe viens a mon secours.) The dogs 
broke out in a desponding wail, as if they felt the 
passage of some unseen phantom. 

She no longer hesitated, the woman's sublime 
unselfishness conquered the natural timidity of 
her sex. Taking the musket from the wall, throw- 
ing the powder horn and bullet bag over her 
shoulder, she boldly stepped out into the Thebaid 
darkness. Bravely she went on, though fancy 
sketched everywhere frightful spectres in the trees, 
imagination draped phantoms in the swaying- 
branches, to which fear lent the finishing touches. 
The howling of the wolves gave voice to the deso- 
ation of the scene. There are times when nature, 
weary of her muteness, seems to lend tongues to 
stones, voices to the reeds and to the winds, lan- 
guage to the articulate lamentations oi the brute 
creation. That voice which ever and anon arose 
flute -like through the frightful orchestral recital 
of nature's woes was her compass. The howling 
sobs of the dogs, so allied to terror of the super- 
natural, warned her that she had neared her des- 
tination. She fired her musket upward, and by 
the flash saw that a giant tree had been felled by 
the strong arm of the tempest. Moans issued 



Legends of Le Detroit. 55 

from near, and she soon learned that her husband 
lay beneath it. Powerless alone, she flew to the 
fort, returning shortly with several brave sol- 
diers who extricated Delorme from his perilous 
position. He was tenderly carried to his home 
and his injuries examined and fortunately pro- 
nounced not fatal. His companion was dead, his 
skull having been fractured. They asked how it 
was that his voice had reached Barbe. He could 
not explain save that he had implored the spirit 
of his friend to send Barbe to him, as it would 
pass near her home, only a short distance away. 
And the strong bond of friendship which even 
death could not sever, sent its message to Barbe 
as it glided towards the spirit land.

by the English, who finding 
all their efforts futile whilst so 
jealously guarded by France, 
determined to wait until the 
rigid watchfulness of the garri- 
son should relax by apparent security. In the 
early spring of 1712 the opportunity seemed to 
present itself. De la Forest, the successor of La

French had not returned from their winter hunt-

ing in the gloomy recesses of tlie forest, whilst 
the fort was manned by a small number of men 
"with Du Buisson as its temporary commander. 

A band of Macoutins and Outagamies* or Poxes, 
were sent by the English, who lit their camp-iire 
beneath the shadow of the fort, and pitched their 
tents in seeming confidence almost within the range 
‚Ä¢of its guns. But Du Buisson was too well versed 
in the craftiness of the Indians, and too experienced 
in their peculiar mod,e of warfare to be deceived by 
this semblance of friendship. Nor did he neglect 
those measures of prudence and forethought neces- 
sary to secure him against a siege. Under pretext of 
fearing an attack from the Miamis, he ordered all 
the grain to be brought into the fort from the store- 
Tiouses, which were built outside of the fortifica- 
tions, and caused the buildings to be destroyed as a 
precautionary measure against fire. He' sent word 
to the Hurons and Pottawatomies that he was in 
danger, and to hasten to his assistance. Daily the 
number of the Poxes seemed to increase, and see- 
ing that their lawless acts met with no punish- 
ment, they became more and more insolent. The 
little fort held bravely on, and though a powerful 
.and merciless foe lay crouching at its gates, watch-

ing its every movement, and ready to pounce on 
its prey, the garrison seemed not to notice it, and 
went along its daily routine. 

But beneatli that calm and indifferent exterior 
many were the sad and weary hearts ; for all were 
under the influence of a feeling which was calcu- 
lated to paralyze the energies of the boldest, since, 
unless succor should soon arrive, their loved lily 
of France, crimsoned by their hearts' blood, would 
be replaced by the cross of St. George, and their 
reeking scalps, hung at the savage's belt, would 
record the fearful history of Fort Pontchartrain. 
The brave Du Buisson would try to rouse them- 
by his example, relating the deeds of French sol- 
diers at other far and desolate forts, whilst the 
gentle chaplain, Deniau, would tell them to place 
their trust in God, to remember their distant 
homes and their loved ones. A new light would- 
come to their eyes, heavy from long, weary vigils, 
and new courage steal into their hearts and nerve 
their arms to deeds of daring. 

At last Saguina, Chief of the Ottawas, and 
Makisabe, Chief of the Pottawatomies, with their 
dusky warriors in all the full regalia of war and 
the haughty waving crests of the eagle and 
bright sashes of vermillion, lit up the landscape, 
while their savage war whoops awoke the echoes 
of the forests, and found a response in the anxious- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 5 9 

hearts of the besieged garrison. Branches of the 
Sacs* Illinois, and e^^en Osages and Missonris, 
had hastened to the relief of the fort, borne along 
by a spirit of hereditary warfare against the 
restless Poxes and Macoutins, or "dwellers in the 
prairies," who were the roaming brigands of the 
wilds of America. Saguina presented himself at 
the fort and said to Du Buisson : "Father, behold 
thy children, compass thee round. We will, if 
need be, gladly die for our father, only take care 
of our wives and our children, and spread a little 
grass over our bodies to protect them against the 
flies." 

The Foxes were driven back and forced to throw 
up entrenchments and were reduced to the last 
extremity. Availing themselves of a stormy night 
they crept away under the friendly shelter of the 
darkness, and fortified themselves at Presque Isle, 
near Windmill Point, eight miles distant from 
Detroit, and at the entrance of Lake Ste. Claire. 
When the Hurons and other French allies discover- 
ed their flight they were soon in pursuit. For some 
days the Foxes held their fort but at last fell be- 
neath the tomahawk of the besieger, f In vain Du 
Buisson endeavored to stop the fearful massacre, 
but his voice fell on ears open only to catch the

agonizing wails of the victims, the sweetest music to 
the Indian warrior. The ground was saturated with 
blood, and the dead as numerous as the leaves of 
the forest; the blood-curdling yells of the conquer- 
ors, mingled with the groans of the dying, made 
so fearful a picture that the French soldiers, ac- 
customed to war and carnage, turned away with 
sickened hearts. The allies carried away their 
dead and wounded, but left the remains of the 
‚ñ†conquered to the mercy of the elements and 
to become the prey of the birds. Shortly after- 
vi^ards the last remnants of the Fox nation came 
to Presque Isle to ' ' hold the feast of the dead ' ' 
and to cover the bones of their warriors that 
they would no longer be excluded from the 
happy hunting ground of their ancestors. To- 
day their bleached bones are exposed by the ruth- 
less plow, and any one interested in Indian antiq- 
uities can have that interest gratiiied by a visit to 
Presque Isle. 

Years after the dreadful massacre which con- 
verted the beautiful spot called Presque Isle into 
the grave of the Fox nation, a stone mill was 
built there by a French settler, who came to 
reside with his sister Josette, undaunted by the 
ourrent traditions which peopled it with the spir- 
its of the departed warriors. Jean was a quiet, 
morose man, different from the laughing, careless,

pleasure-loving Canadian, ‚Äî for rare were his visits, 
to the fort, and it was noticed that he never lin- 
gered over his cidre, nor spoke to the smiling, 
piquante daughters of the habitants. Men 
shrugged their shoulders, and the fair damsels 
pouting their pretty lips would cluster around 
the coureur des bois, who, going everywhere, was 
the recognized gossip of the day, and ask him 
why Jean was so' different from others, while with. 
a vsdse look on his face, the coureur would reply 
that Jean had met with a disappointment in his. 
early youth, and had since kept shy of the fair 
sex, by a vow which was then customary, for when. 
a man' s addresses were Once refused he seldom 
tried a second time. 

Josette was much older than her brother, and 
by dint of thrift and economy had saved enough 
to become a half owner in the mill. The favored 
few who had tasted her " croquecignoles " * and 
"galette au beurre," spoke of it as an era in 
their existence. Naught disturbed the monotony 
of their lives ; each day was but a repetition. The 
river flowed calmly on, the birds sang their songs ‚Äî 
for nature has no moods, they belong to man alone. 
At last Josette fell sick. Jean attended her as

kind of bread, to -which is added milk and butter. 



'62 Legends of Le Detroit. 

‚ñ†carefully as he could, and like a prudent man, 
would frequently ask her to whom she would leave 
her interest in the mill. Irritable from suffering, 
she became annoyed at his importunities, accused 
him of taking care of her for the sake of obtain- 
ing her money, and told him ' ' she would leave it 
to the devil." Jean tried in his clumsy fashion, 
to soothe her. He sent for some of his kindred 
to reason with her, but they only infuriated her 
the more, and she solemnly declared that not one 
‚ñ†of them should have her share in the mill, but 
" she would sooner leave it to the devil." 

Josette recovered, however, and with that per- 
Tersity born of stubbornness, would not relent. 
A few months afterwards she was found dead in 
her bed, having died suddenly. That same night, 
whilst the candles threw their dim shadowy light 
in the room of the dead, a furious storm arose, 
lashing the waves against the shore, the winds 
howling fiercely around the point, the black 
‚Ä¢clouds chasing each other across the lowering 
skies, as lurid gleams of lightning and deafening 
reverberations of thunder, made all the habitants 
shudder while they crossed themselves and told 
their beads. All at once there came so tremen- 
duous a shock that it seemed to swallow the 
island. The old stone mill was rent in twain. A 
pungent smell of sulphur filled the air, and a

^fiendish, laugh was heard loud above the raging 
¬´torm from the shattered ruins. The arch fiend 
had come to claim his share. 

For years afterwards when a northeast storm 
blew from the lake, making night hideous by its 
echoing peals of thunder, it was said that a hairy 
figure, with a horned head and forked tail tipped 
with fire, his mouth and eyes darting forth ruddy 
flame, could be seen in the mill, trying to put 
together the ruined machinery to grind the 
devil's grist. And the lonely wayfarer to Grosse 
Pointe would see the marshes around Presque 
Isle all illuminated by flames, called by the hab- 
itants feu-follet,* which would try to inveigle 
the unhappy traveler and bring him to help grind 
the devil's grist.

IX 

JEAN CHIQUOT. 



A Iiei:end of Charlevoix's Visit. 

A GRAND council of all the neighboring tribes 
of Le Detroit had been convened early in the 
spring of 1721. Thither came the witty, 
brave, but deceitful Huron, the Athenian of the 
American forest; the stern. Spartan-like Iroquois, 
the gaudy Ottawa, and eloquent Pottawatomie 
resplendent in swaying feathers and brilliant in 
dashes of vermillion. 

Alphonse de Tonty, Baron de Palude, Com- 
mandant of Fort Pontchartrain, explained to the 
red warriors the object of the assembly. By his 
side stood a man of fine, imposing appearance 
whose dress revealed his priestly character, and 
whose eager, observant eye glanced from object 
to object with that lightning flash of mental 



Legends of Le Detroit. 65 

photography which transmits to the pen with 
wonderful faithfulness its impressions. He was 
introduced as the bearer of messages and presents 
from Onontio to his forest children. It was the 
distinguished traveler and priest, Charlevoix, 
whose writings are our chief authority as to the 
condition of the West in those early days. 

One edict in an instant electrified the statue- 
like audience, causing the mask of immobility 
to drop before the sweeping blast of kindled 
passion which broke forth in a sullen roar like a 
mighty cataract. It was the prohibition of selling 
liquor to them, ‚Äî a custom introduced by Cadillac 
and continued by his successors, notwithstanding 
the earnest protestations of the Jesuits, who saw 
in the dim future the fatal calamities which 
would befall the colony engendered by this disas- 
trous traffic. 

Amidst the deep grunts and murmurs of dis- 
sent, Onanguice, the great Pottawatomie orator 
rose, and in an impassioned voice with torrents 
of burning eloquence, poured out his indignant 
protest. ' ' We know that firewater does us no 
good, it steals our tongues and our hands. You 
have made us taste it, and now we cannot do 
without 'it. If you refuse to give it to us, we 
shall get it from your enemies, the English." 
Drawing his blanket around him he haughtily 



66 Legends of Le Detroit. 

stepped out of the council, followed by all the 
warriors, who filed along the narrow trail in 
silence to the Pottawatomie village, two miles 
below the fort. 

De Tonty was annoyed and thought the meas- 
ure unwise, and still more for personal reasons, 
as, if tradition be true, he was not averse to 
exchange a gill of brandy for a pound of beaver 
skins, for then every white man's hand weighed 
a pound.* De Tonty called one of the traders 
and told him in confidence to take a cask of 
brandy to the Pottawatomie village, to secure 
thus the valuable furs which the Indians were 
known to have taken during their winter hunt- 
ing, and which owing to the edict v/oiild pass 
into the hands of the English ; that he (De 
Tonty) would protect the trader (Jean Cliiquot) 
from all harm ‚Äî the proceeds to be divided be- 
tween them. Jean started off. Arriving at the 
village he found the old sachems in council, and 
the younger ones roaming about idle. To these 
he proposed the game of bowl,f the stakes being 
measures of brandy which he exchanged for 
their furs. The offer was eagerly accepted, and 

* It was a custom then among traders to put their hands on the 
senile in weighing furs, thus pressing it down, unbeknown to the 
Indian. Consequently the term "each white man's hand weighed 
a pound."

each. Indian rushed to his wigwam to bring his 
pelletries, until there rose a pile which, made 
Jean' s eyes glisten and his imagination swim over 
with the probabilities which the sale of these sug- 
gested. 

The Indians are inveterate gamblers and will 
stake anything they possess with the most sub- 
lime recklessness. Human nature is in every 
age the same where traffic is concerned, though, 
culture and education apparently refine the meth- 
od and soften the terms ‚Äî ^but the underlying prin- 
ciple remains. The shrewd trader of those days 
understood as well as the present one, the art of 
playing skillfully on the foibles of others and 
making of them a source of revenue. 

Sides were chosen and the air rang with the 
wild, guttural sounds of the savages as the bowl 
touched the ground and the little, painted pieces 
of bone were tossed in the air. The seductive- 
ness of the game penetrated into the grave coun- 
cil of the sachems and drew them into its fasci- 
nating vortex. 

Jean' s gains in furs steadily increased, and so 
did the Indians' desire to obtain the coveted 
liquor, which was drunk as fast as won. Towards 
night the pandemonium of giddy excitement 
subsided, and the players lay strewn about in 
helpless intoxication. Jean strapped his heavy 



68 Legends of Le Detroit. 

pile of skins to his back and slowly wended Ms 
way towards tlie fort. It was a glorious evening. 
Drops of moonliglit fell throngli tlie budding 
foliage of the trees and glistened like scattered 
gems in the grass. Jean was in that happy frame 
of mind which a good bargain concluded by a 
generous draught of eau de vie is apt to produce, 
and thought how bright and attractive the world 
looked to him in contrast with the morning, when 
he first heard the edict. Whether he looked dif- 
ferent to the world was a question Jean did not 
ask himself. 

Suddenly his meditations were rudely broken 
by a number of ' ' Dames Blanches,' ' * who were 
dancing around an oak tree, and who, as soon as 
they saw, Jean, caught hold of him and made 
him dance until he was ready to drop with ex- 
haustion. He who a few moments before felt as 
if he trod on air and walked like a god on the 
clouds, now thought his feet imprisoned in irons. 
In vain he pleaded to be let alone ; wild laughter 
was his only answer. His pack fell off, and with 
swift hands the fairies had each secured one of 
his valuable furs. The physical fatigues of the 
man were forgotten in the natural instincts of 

* Literally "White Ladies," a term used to designate the little 
fairies which were then implicitly helieved in by many of the 
superstitious habitants. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 69 

the trader, and Jumping up Jean pursued the 
"Dames Blanches." Round and round they 
flew until Jean grew dizzy, and then just as he 
would think he had secured his prize the fairy 
would vanish in the earthj leaving a spring of 
clear water in which he could hear the mocking 
laughter of his toi*mentdr. Almost distracted 
and achiiig in every bone, he picked up the few 
remaining f ars which had escaped the clutches of 
the fairy robbers and again started on his home- 
ward journey. 

He was obliged to pass near the Sand Hills,* 
which were used by the Indians as a burying- 
ground. On several mounds he noticed a num- 
ber of caged birds, f which fluttering against their 
bars, made a weird sound that sent a doleful 
message to Jean's heart and a cold chill down 
his back, for he was not as brave as an hour 
before. Just as he was urging his weary, bat- 
tered feet to the utmost, he heard a wild, demoni- 
acal shriek, and looking up cautiously saw on a 
branch of a tree a Loup Grarou who gave him a

Chiefs to Robert Navarre, Jr. 

\ When an Indian maiden died the Indians imprisoned a young 
bird until it first began to sing, then loading it with kisses and 
caresses they loosed its bonds over the grave, in the belief that it 
would not fold its wings until it flew to the spirit land and deliv- 
ered its precious burden.

he always carried '‚ñ†'‚ñ†en cas.''''* 

When the trader got up and rubbed his eyes and 
straightened his bruised limbs he looked about in 
vain for his foe, then ran breathlessly to the fort 
where he related his strange adventures, but was 
met with smiles of incredulity. 

Early next morning he started with several 
skeptical companions for the scenes of the night 
before. To their amazement the grass seemed 
scorched around the oak tree and everywhere 
little fountains were bubbling forth their strange 
tale. Where the. Loup Garou had disappeared a 
sulphur spring had sprung up. The place was 
ever afterwards called by the French *'La Belle 
Fontaine," by the English, Springwells, and ac- 
cording to the tradition of an old habitant, ' ' La 
Belle Fontaine water gives complexion brilliante, 
wile ze sulphur spring cure ze internal com- 
plaint."

THE WIDOW'S CURSE. 



A Legrend of the old Pear Trees. 




‚ñ†w- T WAS Mardi Gras evening in 1735. 
A furious storm raged outside, the 
wind howled through the leafless 
trees, and the restless waters of Lake 
Ste. Claire were fast imprisoned in ice. 
But there were sounds of merriment 
in the house of Charles Chauvin. It was built of 
hewn logs and fronted the lake, where the new 
water works now stand. The lights from the 
windows were like bright beams of promise in that 
waste of darkness. A party was gathered in la 
salle a manger (dining-room) to celebrate Shrove 
Tuesday. The floor was partly covered with a 
rag carpet, whose bright tints lent a glow of 
warmth to the room. The furniture was covered 



T2 Legends of Le pStroit. 

in chintz and the legs carved in grotesque effigies 
of birds, the classifying of which would have 
driven Cuvier to despair. A cupboard reaching 
to the ceiling displayed rows of blue china, of a 
thickness which would now alleviate the fear of 
many house-keepers and defy the rough handling 
of the modern servant. 

Before an open fireplace with its crackling, hick- 
ory log, stood three girls, each armed with a long- 
handled frying pan and trying to toss pancakes 
‚Äî " vii'ez les crepes " ‚Äî a custom still preserved in 
many of the old French families. Near by were 
several who poured in the batter as fast as the pans 
were emptied, whilst la dame Ohauvin placed 
powdered maple sugar between the cakes and piled 
them up in pyramid form. The art consisted in 
tossing the light cake as high as possible while 
turning it. It was accomplished by a dexterous 
motion of the hand, and merry were the peals of 
laughter which greeted the unfortunate one whose 
cake fell on the glowing coals. 

The table was set with savory meats, and all ate 
with a relish inspired by the morrow which would 
be Ash Wednesday, for Lent then was rigidly 
kept. The forfeits were redeemed all save la dame 
Chauvin' s, who only was released when she prom- 
ised to tell them a conte (story). " What shall it 
be ? " she said. ' ' Oh tell us, grandmere, about the

old mill on Connor's Creek and tlie twelve pear 
trees in our orchard," answered the bright-eyed 
Susanne, a little thing of twelve. 

Caressing gently the dark hair of the girl, the 
old dame began : 

Just such a night as this, many years ago, Felix 
Robert brought his young wife to live in the mill 
he had just built near Pont Rouge (Red Bridge) 
on Connor's Creek. His brother Louis accompa- 
nied them. It was impossible to find a greater 
contrast. Felix was short, with laughing eyes 
and a pleasant word for everyone. He loved a 
ball or a race on the ice with that true zest of en- 
joyment which the old habitants possessed in so 
eminent a degree. Louis was tall and spare, with 
a yellow, lean face, silent and reserved in manner. 
Seldom did he enter in the simple pleasures of 
those days. His presence seemed like a paU, 
and the old habitant would say : " C est un oiseau 
d'une mauvaise augure ' ' (he is a bird of ill omen). 
The mill prospered, ‚Äî they appeared to live in har- 
mony ; children gathered around the hearth, but 
the morose Louis paid little heed to them, for his 
two cows seemed to be the only things for which 
he entertained aifection. 

Felix was fatally injured by a falling tree and 
expired soon after, though not before he had 
made Louis promise to watch over his wife and 



74: Legends of Le Detroit. 

children, and to set aside for them a half of the' 
proceeds of the mill. 

After his brother's death Louis grew more and 
more absorbed in himself ; the children kept out 
of his way as if by instinct, hushing their infan- 
tile prattle when his shadow fell across the thresh- 
old ; and he developed the true traits of a miser. 
Food was measured for the home consumption, 
and he looked scrupulously after every detail of 
the simple menage. In vain the widow pleaded 
she was starving. The inflexible man would not 
listen. He would not allow them out of his sight, 
and no complaint could she make, for he gave her 
no opportunity of conversing with any one, and 
few came to the mill except on business, and none 
cared to loiter. 

One by one the children drooped and were laid 
to rest. The mother implored in vain more food 
and warmer clothing, and soon her frail form told 
that her days were numbered. One day, escap- 
ing the severe vigilance of her stern guardian, she 
wandered off towards the pear trees, the stately 
survivors of the age of Louis XIY., which, proud 
in their decay, leave no successors, as if unwilling 
to allow their race to be perpetuated in new soil. 
Her absence was discovered, and fearing she 
might betray his miserly habits to his neighbors,, 
Louis came to lead her back quickly to the house 



Legends of Le Detroit. 75 

saying he could not afford to feed lazy people ; lie 
had supported her long enough. It was time to 
work. 

Raising her hands to Heaven she cried out : 
" Woe, woe is my lot. I call these twelve trees, 
which are named after the Apostles, to witness 
my wrongs. May your property be swept away, 
your cows refuse to give milk, and you yourself 
be haunted by me and by my children. You have 
defrauded the widow and the orphan ; you have 
starved them to death and broken a solemn prom- 
ise to the dead. The pear tree under which you 
stand vsdll be shunned by its comrades, and like 
Judas, stand alone, for the curse of the widow 
rested on an object beneath it." 

Shortly afterwards she died. The habitants 
were indignant, and avoided Louis more than 
ever. It was soon rumored that strange things 
were going on at the mill. Weird sounds were 
heard on Sunday nights especially, and one with 
more courage or curiosity than the others peeped 
through the cracks of the mill and saw a great 
number of black cats, "all dancing like Chris- 
tians," he said, whilst the time was beaten by 
phantom hands which seem to float about in the 
air. The people shook their heads mysteriously, 
saying that it was "le- Sabbat des chats"* (the 

*Cats were believed to be in league with the devil, who frequent-

cat's Sabbat) and hinted at secret dealings with 
the evil one. The cows sickened and died, the 
habitants refused to bring their corn to the grist 
for they heard such piteous wails and saw there 
cadaverous, ghostly hands as if imploring for 
food. The old pear tree was found one morning 
mysteriously separated from its companions on 
the north side and its withered leaves and droop- 
ing boughs spoke of some blight which had rob- 
bed it of its proud and stately beauty.* 

Louis saw all this and his land passed into the 
hands of strangers. He left, no one ever hearing 
again of him, and with him died the Widow's 
Curse.

cat has the power of assisting at the " Sabbat," to prevent which 
they frequently cut a piece off the tail or ear (C. Vaugeors, His- 
toire des Antiquities de la Ville de I'Algle, p. 586).

LE LUTIN. 



A Iieirend of the Goblin Horseman. 

N 1796, when the Stars 
and Stripes first waved 
in proud exaltation over 
the hanghty standard of 
England, there lived on 
the banks of the beauti- 
ful Lake Sainte Claire, 
at Grrosse Pointe, an old 
French habitant named Jean Marie Tetit, dit le 
merveilleux. 

It was a noticeable custom in those early days 
to give each other soubriquets, and with that 
wonderful perceptiveness of the French which 
almost amounts to a sixth sense, the nickname 
would be a happy hit at some marked character- 




78 Legends of Le Detroit. 

istic. To-day some of the descendants of these 
old families are known only by the soubriquet ; 
other branches still bear the Original name, but 
in several cases the old name has entirely dis- 
appeared. 

Jean Marie was a famous raconteur, equaling 
Vernon, of the Long Bow. On autumn after- 
noons the habitants would congregate at his 
house, and only when the shadows had length- 
ened into twilight and the church bell pealed 
the evening hour, would the spell-bound listeners 
slowly come back to the realities of life and give 
a thought to the impatient housewife and waiting 
meal. Perhaps it was the soft beauty of the 
scene, lit up by the hazy, luminous atmosphere 
peculiar to Indian summer which gave a more 
brilliant hue to the glowing forest trees, a rosy 
tint to the placid waters of the lake, a touch of 
picturesqueness to the group of habitants, with 
their eager, expectant faces, which lent its seduc- 
tive charm to Jean Marie' s imagination. Quietly 
taking a few whiffs from his loved pipe fiUed 
with killikanick (a weed used by the Indians in 
the absence of tobacco, and from which a fancy 
brand of Virginia tobacco takes its name), and 
in the midst of that hushed silence which is 
in itself an eloquent tribute to the raconteur's 
powers, he would relate the wonderful stories of 



Legends of Le Detroit. Y9 

"Le Lutin," and "Le Loup Garou" (wehr- 
wolf); the first of whicli is as follows : 

Jacques L' Esperance, or Jaco, as he was famil- 
iarly called ' ' for short, ' ' on the death of his father 
found himself sole proprietor of a fine "con- 
cession" at Grosse Pointe. The soil was rich, 
the arpents numerous, and all bespoke goodly- 
promise to the industrious farmer. Jaco was not 
lazy, but somehow his efforts did not meet with 
the success which crowned his neighbors. His 
tastes ran towards horses, and he became one of 
the most celebrated horse breeders in that section 
of the country, and was referred to as an oracle 
on the subject. He was in fact the Tom Ochiltree 
of his day. It was in the winter races on the ice 
along the lake shore and Grand Marais that Jaco 
gained his greatest triumph. Perched on the 
high seat of his cariole, well protected from the 
rude blasts by his Indian-blanket coat with its 
deep black stripe, the hood of which was drawn 
tightly over his head, a wide red sash encircling 
his waist, his hands covered with mole-skin gloves, 
his ringing voice could be heard loud above the 
others as he urged his little Canadian pony on : 
' 'Avance done Caribou ! avance Lambreur ! ' ' 
With lightning speed he flew, and ere the sound 
of his voice had died away only a tiny speck on 
the ice marked the steed and its driver. Arriv- 



80 Legends of Le Detroit. 

ing at the Hotel of the Grand Marais, under the 
genial influence of the ' ' liqueur de peche ' ' (peach 
brandy) and the subtle incense of flattery, in his 
enthusiasm he would claim for his pony a speed 
which even in these days of St. Julien and Maud 
S., with their unprecedented records, would be 
considered marvelous, " clearing at a bound," he 
said, " cracks in the ice twenty feet wide." 

We must acknowledge that the present Cana- 
dian pony is a degenerate scion of a fine stock, 
for they are mostly descended from a cross 
between a noble stallion, caught wild on the 
prairies of Mexico, the breed half Arabian and 
Spanish, (having been introduced there by Her- 
nando Cortes in his conquest of that country in 
1520 and brought here by the Indians in 1750,) 
and a splendid JSTorman mare, brought to this 
country by Gen. Braddock and taken from him 
at his defeat near Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh). 
Ten years later Capt. Morris, of his Majesty's 
Seventeenth Regiment of Infantry, who visited 
the country of the Illinois under the guidance of 
Jacques Godfroy in 1764, mentions in his Journal 
seeing this handsome milk-white horse still in 
possession of the Indians. 

Jaco could be seen every day driving his favor- 
ite along the lake shore, and L' Eclair (light- 
ning), as he called her, carried herself as if 



Legends of Le Detroit. 81 

conscious of the admiration which she created. 

One night, with the rest of the habitants, Jaco 
went to Antoine Griffard's, whose magic violin 
could compel the most unwilling feet to chase 
the flying hours. At dawn, going to the stable 
to harness L' Eclair, for he had a long drive, he 
found her all covered with foam, her mane all 
tangled with burrs. Annoyed that anyone should 
have played him such a trick, but not wishing to 
express any suspicion for fear of making a 
disturbance, Jaco like a prudent man held his 
tongue, but determined that when he came to 
another ball, a less valuable horse would be his 
companion. But the next morning, and the next, 
he found his favorite with dejected head, tired 
and wearied as if she had been driven hard all 
night. He put a padlock on his barn door, strewed 
ashes about to discover the footsteps, yet to his 
great amazement he found L' Eclair in the same 
lamentable plight, the padlock intact and no im- 
press on the ashes. 

At length Jaco, much perplexed, went to con- 
sult one of his great cronies who listened atten- 
tively to his story, and at its conclusion, gazing 
around cautiously as if afraid of being overheard, 
whispered hurriedly, "C'est Le Lutin qui la 
soigne," (it is the goblin who takes care of her). 

Le Lutin was a dreaded monster which had 

6

haunted tlie Pointe many years before, and was 
supposed, when for some reason he took a dislike 
to an habitant, to tantalize him by riding his fin- 
est horses by night. Jaco was not credulous. He 
shook his head smilingly and said it was the 
work of some enemy jealous of L' Eclair. He 
had heard of "La bete a Cornes," or horned 
beast, as some called Le Lutin, but only thought 
of it as one of the stories his mother would 
relate to him in his infancy as she rocked him to 
sleep. His friend told him he should brand his 
horses with a cross, or put an amulet or charm 
about their necks. Jaco returned home sad and 
dejected. He had not met with the counsel he 
wished, and determined to find out for himself 
who this enemy was. 

One bright moonlight night he stationed him- 
self at his window where he could command a 
good view of his barn without being seen himself, 
and armed with his trusty rifle, waited for his 
foe. Not a sound disturbed the night air save 
the low murmuring of the waters against the 
beach, the lone cry of the whip-poor-will, or the 
.occasional plash of some restless bullfrog. All 
nature seemed to slumber. Suddenly a sound 
like the troubled neighing of a horse fell on his 
strained ear, and keeping his eyes on the barn 
doors, he saw them noiselessly open and his 



Legends of Le Detroit. 83 

favorite L' Eclair, trembling like a leaf, fly out. 
On her back was a fearful apparition. Jaco was 
no coward, but he felt his courage oozing out at 
his knees, cold chills chasing each other down 
his back, and great beads of perspiration stand- 
ing on his forehead. The monster resembled a 
baboon, with a horned head, a skin of bristling 
black hair, brilliant, restless eyes, and a devilish 
leer on its face. It clutched with one hand L'- 
Ecl air's mane, and wiUh the other belabored her 
with a stick of the thorn bush, for the fiend rode 
without saddle or bridle. 

Jaco recognized in an instant that his rifle was 
powerless against such a foe, and like a bright 
inspiration came to him the old mode used to 
exorcise a demon ; he seized the holy water font, 
one of which hung at the head of every good 
habitant's bed, and threw it and its contents 
down upon the monster as he passed beneath the 
window. A demoniacal shriek rent the air, the 
horse snorted, reared, and notwithstanding the 
efforts of the fiend, plunged into the chilly waters 
of the lake. Jaco rushed in pursuit, but when 
he arrived at the beach, only the circling eddies 
marked the spot where the affrighted animal and 
its fiendish rider had disappeared. Firing his 
rifle to awaken his neighbors, who, unaccustomed 
to such signals, rushed to find out what was the 



84 Legends of Le Detroit. 

matter, Jaco related his adventure. His disor- 
dered appearance, the absence of the horse, the 
broken fragments of the holy water font, and the 
thorn-bush stick dropped by the goblin, confirmed 
his tale. Like a judicious man he marked all his 
horses thereafter with a cross fearing the return 
of Le Lutin.* And to this day the Grosse Pointe- 
habitants retain this custom, and whenever in 
the early morn on going to the barn they find^a 
favorite horse reeking with sweat and foam, and 
with mane all tangled as if by the claws of a 
beast, they shake their heads mysteriously and 
say that it is Le Lutin come again. 

* Aubrey ia his "Miscellanies" mentions the practice for pre- 
venting nightmare in horses, "to hang in a string a flint with a 
hole in it, by the manger ; but best of all they say hung about 
their necks, and a flint will do it that hath not a hole in it. It is 
to prevent the nightmare, viz: the hag from riding their horses- 
that will sometimes sweat all night. The flint thus hung does- 
hinder it." Herrick says: 

"Hang up hooks and shears to scare 

Hence the hag that rides the mare 

Till they be all over wet 

With the mire and the sweat, 

Tliis observed, the manes shall be 

Of your horses, all knot free."

THE WARRIOR'S LOVE. 



A Legend of Bois Blanc. 



HE admirable site of Bois Blanc on the 
Canadian side of tlie mouth of the De- 
troit River, commanding the main chan- 
nel, attracted in the early days of the 
‚ñ†^ colony, the eye of the experienced sol- 
dier. It was for a long time a mooted question 
whether Fort Pontchartrain would remain at 
Detroit or be removed to this island. It received 
its name from a superb forest of white wood, but 
it was shorn of its crown of glory by an act of 
vandalism during that brief panic of patriotism 
in 1837, caUed by the self-styled "patriots " The 
Patriot War. They felled these glorious giant 
trees for purposes of military observation. Here 
'Tecumseh and his warriors in 1813 awaited the 



86 Legends of Le Detrmt. 

issue of the Battle of Lake Erie, and as soon as 
the fatal import to the English was known, the 
chief crossed over to Maiden, then garrisoned by- 
Proctor. To his amazement he found the British 
commander making hurried preparations to evac- 
uate without the faintest show of resistance. 
Forced to passive obedience by circumstances he 
could not crush and despising the cowardice of 
the act, Tecumseh begged Proctor to leave him 
arms and ammunition, that he and his braves 
might defend the fort against the victorious- 
Americans. The British general's refusal to do 
so called forth the stinging and. contemptuous 
remark from the outraged savage, ' ' that he (Proc- 
tor) was like a fat cur sneaking away with his 
tail between his legs, after making a great show 
of courage." 

After Charlevoix's visit in 1722 to these re- 
gions, a Huron mission was established on this 
island under the direction of Fathers Potier and 
de la Richardie. Several hundred of the tribe 
came, and soon their tents blossomed like wild 
flowers through the woods. The joyous laughter 
of children sent its warm, exhilarating tones over 
the waters. The sweet sound of the bell from 
the rude, birchen chapel bade the echoes of the 
forest awake and respond gladly to the message- 
of redemption. But the English with their 



Legends of Le Detroit. 8T 

eager desire to extend their trade to the West, 
sowed seeds of dissension among the Indians and 
poisoned their hearts against the French. In 
1747 a general uprising of all the tribes took 
place, and Bois Blanc became the theatre of a 
conspiracy to massacre the French at Fort Pont- 
chartrain. It was betrayed to De Longueil, the 
Commandant, who used wise and precautionary 
measures which not only stemmed the tide of 
savage mutiny, but restored peace and order. 
Still it was considered more prudent to remove 
the Huron mission nearer the fort. Bois Blanc 
was abandoned, and the settlement located at 
Sandwich, the present church there being the 
successor of the one built by Father Potier. 

Oae incident of early days invests this island 
with romantic interest, where the noble heart of 
a Huron chief became the sacrifice of a glorious; 
self-devotion. Many years have passed since that 
act, but it is still handed down from generation 
to generation. White Pawn was the daughter 
of a celebrated Huron brave who had accom- 
panied DeBellestre to Montreal to see the Grov- 
emor, and whilst there had died. Her mother 
who belonged to the pale-face, had faded away 
many years before. The maiden was the pride 
of the tribe, and her admirers, as numerous as 
the leaves of the forest, endeavored to woo her 



88 Legends of Le Detroit. 

by their peculiar mode of courtship. They 
would whittle tiny sticks and throw them at her. 
If the girl picked them up the Indian's suit 
was favored, but if she heeded them not he 
carefully collected and buried them with- his 
unrequited affection. White Fawn had shyly 
hesitated over the love tokens of a distinguished 
warrior, thereby conveying that she needed more 
time. 

One day he returned from the forest, bringing 
a wounded hunter, whom he had accidentally 
shot. The medicine men worked their charms 
over the stranger, and the maiden nursed him 
tenderly, for she knew that if the pale-face died 
there would be a shadow on the heart of the 
warrior. But soon a mist came over her eyes, 
and the voice of the brave which had been as 
the Slimmer wind, to which she bent like the 
reed, no longer whispered its sweet song. The 
traditions of her mother's race found their way 
to her heart ; the words of the pale-face became 
stars and the heart of the maiden the lake 
whereon they rested, and as he looked down he 
saw no other light reflected there. The warrior 
soon noticing the change, upbraided the maiden, 
who bowed her head in silence. The bright knife 
of the Indian gleamed a second in his uplifted 
hand, but the next instant it was whirled far out 



Legends of Le Detroit. 89 

Into tlie river and burying its keen edge in the 
peaceful waters. "No," said the Indian, "the 
arm of Kenen is stronger than his voice and his 
anger like the mighty tempest that sweeps over 
the forest, but he is not strong, enough to strike 
the heart of the White Fawn." 

Shortly afterward the tribe removed to their 
winter hunting grounds, and the Iroquois, the 
hereditary foes of the Hurons, becoming annoyed 
at some act, warred against them. Among the 
prisoners that they captured was the pale -face, 
whom they brought to Bois Blanc. Here, where 
everything spoke to him of his former happiness, 
was he to take his last fa,rewell of life, with no 
friendly voices, or kind, comforting words to 
soothe his agony. A hush fell on the assembled 
Indians gathered around to see the pale-face die. 
A haughty warrior advanced, and despite the 
usual decorum of the council, the name of Kenen 
ran in sounding tones around the circle. "Have 
the Iroquois heard the name of Kenen?" he 
asked. " There is no greater in his nation," was 
the reply. The dark eye of the Huron flashed 
proudly. "Let the pale-face be free," he said, 
' ' a Huron chief will take his place. ' ' The cords 
were severed which bound the white man, and 
the Huron whispered to him : ' ' There is sorrow 
in the heart of the White Fawn, and the eyes of 



90 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Kenen cannot look upon it. When he is gone- 
the White Fawn will be happy in the shelter she 
loves." So quickly was all done that the pale- 
face had not time to remonstrate. He was borne- 
along to a canoe, and soon swift oars wafted hinv 
from the fatal spot. When the bright moon rose, 
the spirit of the warrior rested on the bosom of 
his fathers.

THE MIAMI SEER'S PROPHECY. 



A Legrend of Braddock's Defeat. 

DE CELERON, whilst commander of Fort 
Pontchartrain, had received orders to reas- 
sert the French claim to all the country west 
of the AUeghanies. He did so by ordering the 
English traders away and placing at the junction 
of the Alleghany and Monongahela Rivers a sil- 
ver plate, upon which was this inscription : "In 
the year 1749 during the reign of Louis XV., 
King of France, we, Celeron, commander of a 
detachment sent by the Marquis de la Galisson- 
niere, commander-in-chief of New France, for 
the restoration of tranquility in some villages of 
Indians in this district, have buried this plate at 
the confluence of the Ohio and Tchadakoin this 
29 th day of July, near the River Ohio, otherwise 



‚ñ†^2 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Beautiful River, as a monument of the renewal 
of possession which we have taken of the said 
River Ohio and of all those that therein fall and 
‚Ä¢of all the said lands on both sides as far as the 
sources of said rivers, as enjoyed, or ought to be 
‚ñ†enjoyed, by the preceding King of France, and 
as they therein maintained themselves by arms 
and by treaties, especially by those of Ryswick, 
of Utrecht, and of Aix-la-Chapelle. " 

Petty hostilities between France and England 
had been growing warmer for years, until in 1755 
they had reached a degree when open warfare 
seemed inevitable. England determined to stop 
the so-called encroachments of the French by 
sending a vast army to join the recruits raised by 
the Colonists along the Atlantic. The latter were 
to light the torch of war bj^ attacking the French 
posts between Fort Duquesne (Pittsburg) and 
Niagara. 

In the early spring of 1755 DeBellestre, the 
commander of Fort Pontchartrain, received or- 
ders from the Governor General of New France 
to summon every able-bodied man to arms and to 
rouse the Indian tribes even as far as the Missis- 
sippi. For many days the little fort was the 
scene of unusual commotion. Scouts had been 
sent to the Indian tribes of the North and West, 
‚Ä¢detachments of which were constantly arriving 



Legends of Le Detroit. 93- 

in answer to the summons. DeBellestre was to 
remain at the fort ; his nncle, Alexis des Ruis- 
seaux, was to command the outgoing regulars.. 
The militia were awaiting orders for an immediate 
march to the Ohio, with detachments of Indians 
and coureurs des bois, commanded by Jon- 
caire, Isidore Chesne, Godefroy, Campeau, Medor 
Gamelin, La Butte and Jadot. Pontiac with the 
Ottawas, Sauteurs, Poux, and all the tribes of 
the North, Takay of the wicked bands of Hurons, 
Baby and Peatan of the Christian band, and Gros 
Oreilles (Big Ears) and Kenouchamek of the 
Loups and Shawnees, hastened to obey the sum- 
mons. They encamped two miles above the 
Huron mission (now Windsor, opposite Detroit). 
As the time approached for the departure of the 
expedition, DeBellestre, well versed, like all the 
French ofiicers, in Indian customs, called a gen- 
eral council of all the tribes, to be held on the 
site of their encampment. Belts of wampum 
were prepared, barrels of eau de vie opened, 
cloths, blankets, ornaments of silver, guns, balls, 
powder and knives were lavishly distributed 
as presents from Onontio to his dusky children. 
Rumors of the extraordinary strength of the 
English marching force had reached the savages. 
Some of the wiser and cooler of the chieftains

risk to be incurred. Bellestre was compelled to 
harangue his savage allies. "My children," he 
said, ' ' are you ungrateful for all the kindness 
Onontio has shown you ? His enemies have come 
upon him like a band of wolves at night, and he 
depends upon his children to run to his aid. 
New presents will be distributed to you on your 
return, and to the families of those who fall a 
double supply shall be given.' ' 

A noted chief of the Miamis, and a renowned 
seer and dreamer, rose to reply. " What my 
father says is true, and my heart sorrows that 
any warrior should refuse to obey Onontio' s call. 
Last night in my sleep I saw a lofty mountain, 
along whose sides marched countless numbers of 
pale-face warriors. Their brilliant scarlet blan- 
kets glowed like the leaves of the sumach in the 
sun. Their polished knives glistened like the 
sleeping waters of the lake under the light of the 
full moon. On a snow-white horse sat their proud 
leader, and his eagle eye seemed to pierce the 
cowardly heart. Great guns on wheels, drawn 
by stout horses, followed in the line which trail- 
ed like a serpent through the valley. Last came 
countless 'long-knife' warriors clad in coats the 
color of the sky. On a black horse at their head 
rode a young chieftain whose stern, majestic face 
and pale blue eye made me shrink. At last, I

thouglit, the tribes are to be driven from their 
Imnting grounds. Desolation will encompass 
every wigwam of tlie West. As I was about to 
flee I heard a shout, and one of our French broth- 
ers, clad in an Indian hunting dress with a silver 
gorget on his breast, leaped from the woods and 
sprang down the hill-side. As he waved his sword 
above his head I saw the warriors of our tribes, 
the Miamis, the Ottawas, the Loups, the Hurons, 
the Shawnees and . others dart from behind every 
tree, and pour in a fire which fell like hail upon 
the proud foe, and as the leaves before a hurri- 
cane the red-coats went down. In vain their 
brave chief tried to rally them ; they fled, and 
their leader was slain. Had it not been for the 
pale blue-eyed chief of the 'long-knives,' every 
scalp would have hung at the belts of our war- 
riors. Though bullet after bullet was sent after 
him, and all around him fell, he was untouched, 
for he bore a charmed life. The great Manitou had 
taken him under his wing. Many of our braves 
returned to their camps loaded down with plun- 
der, and one brought the beautiful snow-white 
steed of the red-coat leader. Years hence I see 
her colts, swifter than the wind and numerous as 
the blades of grass scattered over the boundless 
Tplains of the West. Brothers, I have done." 
The warriors who had clustered around listen-

ing eagerly to their inspired seer gave utterance 
to many uglis ! ughs ! expressive of their delight 
and full faith in coming victory. 

The expedition started out. How the brave 
Beaujeu and his Indian followers brought about 
Braddock's defeat, and how the savages came to 
regard Washington, the leader of the "long- 
knives," with superstitious awe are matters of 
history. It is not so well known that from Brad- 
dock' s white mare and a spirited stallion of the 
West, left by Cortes, the hardy, swift Canadian 
and Indian ponies so famous along the lakes, are 
descended.

woven its gossamer web and which history has 
gilded with its magic pencil. 

The spirit who inhabited the Sand Mountains, 
called the "Sleeping Bear,"* had a daughter 
who was endowed with such seductive beauty 
and matchless perfection that the mother feared 
she would be stolen. The spirit hid her in a 
box, tying it by a long string to a stake on the 
beach, and every day would draw the box in 
to feed the fair maiden and comb her yellow 
tresses. 

The South Wind passed once at this hour, and 
saw her. He murmured caressingly his soft and 
balmy sighs through the golden meshes of her 
^flowing hair. This gentle wooing gave birth to 
that beautiful, but too brief, Indian summer. 
The North and West Winds heard of the mys- 
terious beauty through their zephyr couriers. A 
fierce rivalry ensued and the elements were at 
wrar. A violent storm arose, snapped the frail 
thread which held the box to its moorings, and 
it drifted along borne by the waves to the lodge 
‚ñ†of the Prophet, the Keeper of the Gates of the 
Lakes, who resided at the outlet of Lake Huron. 
Joyfully he received as his bride this beautiful 
waif of the foamy billows.

The storm revived in all its fury, sweeping away 
the lodge and portions of the land of the old 
Magician. These floated down and formed the 
islands in the Detroit River. The old Prophet 
was buried beneath Isle au PSche which became 
the Mecca of the Ottawa warriors. 

The fragments of t e box formed Belle Isle, 
and the great Manitou, in order to prevent any 
more contentions, girded the island with rattle- 
snakes. No other sentinels were required to 
^uard the imprisoned , eauty than these reptiles 
with their bewitching craft of eyes and forked 
tongues, and which were held in superstitious 
veneration by the Indians. 

It was in October of 1762 that the wonderful 
"pluie de suie" or "Black Rain"* occurred; 
this day is known in history as the "Black 
Day of Canada." Clouds of inky blackness 
hung over Detroit. Water, land, everything was 
enveloped in ihis sombre drapery of darkness. 
The howling of wolves and the despairing moans 
of animals, combining all that is savage in beast 
and fearful in man, prophesying and deploring 
the approaching misfortune, lent terror to this 
weird carniva of Tenebrae. When the rain fell, 
the drops emitted a strong sulphurous odor, and

were so deeply colored that they could be used 
as ink. Philosophy and science gave their solu- 
tion of this strange phenomenon, but the learned 
explanation fell on deaf ears, for the Canadians 
and Indians read for themselves the mystic lan- 
guage foreboding disaster. 

Pontiac, the wily diplomat of the forest, whose 
eloqxience, subtlefcy and consummate ambition,, 
commanded the admiration of his civilized foes 
and gained for him the title of the Mithridate¬ª 
of the West, viewed these signs as prophetic 
warnings. Following the ancient customs of the 
Indians who prepared themselves for great under- 
takings by fasting,* he dismissed his squaws 
and retinue to the Ottawa village on the eastern 
shore of Le Detroit, and went alone to Isle au 
Peche to consult the Prophet whose bones lay 
beneath. There, amid the calm and picturesque 
scenes of nature, and in that harmonious silence 
so eloquent in its muteness, he conceived the 
plan of that wonderful coup d'etat which has- 
blazoned his name on history's page, by which 
he aimed to destroy all the English forts on the

same day, and to drive the invaders from the 
country. Brought up in the solemn grandeur of 
the primitive forests where no passing mood or 
fancy of the mind but had its image or echo in 
the wild world around, the autumn blast as it 
shrieked its discordant symphonies through the 
forest poured its fierce energy into his heart. 
The sullen roar of the waves as they dashed 
against the beach in foaming rage inflamed his 
resentment ; his fevered imagination saw the 
phantoms of his race urging him on to defend 
their resting-place from the despoiling hand of 
the invader. In the moaning reeds the voice of 
the Prophet bade him gather his tribe, to rise 
up, to be strong as the whirlwind and to go forth 
like the lightning and scatter the English like 
leaves before the autumn wind. 

The evening of the seventh day he returned to 
his tribe, emaciated from his long vigils and 
fasting. He sent his messengers with the war- 
belt of wampum* and the tomahawk stained red 
in token of war, from tribe to tribe, from village 
to village. 

* The Indians among themselves had no written contracts, the 
belt of wampum supplying the place, as a I'eminder of a bond oi' 
promise given. It was painted different colors to suit the occa- 
‚Ä¢sion ; red, for instance, signifying war, etc. The belts were care- 
fully preserved and handed down in the tribe from generation to 
generation. 



102 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Pontiac, as chief of the Metai, a magical asso- 
ciation among the warriors of the lakes, obtained 
great influence over all the tribes which enabled 
him to play on the superstition of his followers. 
He called them to a great council, and in burning 
words of eloquence spoke of the wrongs and 
injuries they had received from the English, and 
revealed to them the command he had received 
from the Prophet of Isle au P^che. The plan 
gave satisfaction to the grave and silent warriors, 
who, drawing their blankets over their heads,, 
retired to their villages to await the signal which 
was to return to them the hunting-grounds of 
their forefathers.

THE BLOODY B.VN. 







A Iiegend of Fontiac's Siege. 

NE briglit May morning in 1763, wMlst Pon- 
tiac and his savage hordes lay before Detroit, 
two men were engaged in earnest conversa- 
tion in front of the council house within the be- 
sieged place. The more conspicuous was a tall, 
determined looking man, clad in the uniform of 
an English officer, whose features were almost 
picturesque in their ruggedness. This was Maj. 
Gladwyn, commander of the post. His abrupt 
and impatient gestures were in striking contrast 
with the easy, graceful manners of his compan- 
ion, Maj. Jean Chapoton, the first surgeon of Fort 
Pontchartrain, who, several years previous to the 
English conquest, had resigned from the French 
army and settled in Detroit. 



104 Legends of Le Detroit. 

It was evident from the eager, anxious glances 
they cast along the street every now and then, 
that they expected some one. Presently they 
were joined by a younger man of medium height, 
but of powerful physique, and whose dress be- 
spoke preparations for a long and tedious jour- 
ney. The new-comer was Jacques Grodefroy de 
Marboeuf, whose kindred, Godefroy de Linctot, 
and Godefroy de Tonnanconr, had come to Canada 
in 1636. Left an orphan at a tender age, he had 
been brought up by his eldest sister, the wife of 
Trotier des Ruisseaux, the sister-in-law of De 
Tonty and DeBellestre, two French Command- 
ants of Fort Pontchartrain. It was the English 
policy to conciliate the French element who were 
placed in a strange and trying position, like 
prisoners on capitulation, and who preserved 
neutral ground in the quarrel between the Eng- 
lish and Indians. Grodefroy' s thorough knowl- 
edge of the Indian habits and customs, his love 
of adventure and his family connection, had 
made him an invaluable acquisition to Grladwyn. 
He and Maj. Chapoton had been sent to try their 
influence on Pontiac, but in vain, and it was at 
the request of the chief (Pontiac) himself that 
Godefroy was now going to the country of the 
Illinois, where a French soldier. Monsieur de 
Leon, still retained command, the object being 



Legends of Le Detroit. 105 

to bring the officer or anotlier influential one to 
‚Ä¢convince tlie Indians that France had no longer 
claims on Detroit ‚Äî a delusion they fondly cher- 
ished and in which they were encouraged by 
many of the French habitants. 

Griadwyn seemed to approve of the project, 
and had been waiting to give Godefroy a few 
instructions before he started out with Mesnil 
Chesne. Godefroy commended to the officer's 
care his infant son and his young relative, Made- 
leine de Tonnancour, and started on his hazard- 
ous journey.* 

Madeleine de Tonnancour was an orphan and 
had been educated at the Ursuline Convent at 
Quebec. Endowed with great personal beauty, 
and possessing more than the usual accomplish- 
ments of the Canadian girl, she became the belle 
of the gay capital of New France. At a ball 
she met the dashing officer, Capt. Dalzell, then 
attached to Sir Jeffrey Amherst' s staff ; it was a 
‚ñ†case of love at first sight. Madeleine's friends 
Tvho bitterly resented the invasion of the Eng- 
lish, opposed the idea of her marriage with an 
English officer, and being a minor and therefore 
rsubject to the control of her relatives she was 
‚Ä¢obliged to succumb to her fate. She entered a

romantic plan of burying herself with relative* 
who resided in the far ofE frontier post, the- 
Detroit of Erie. Here she arrived just as the 
Indian troubles were commencing. The society 
of the little colony was far different from that of 
the gay capital, and no doubt moments of regret 
came for her hasty act of self -exile. 

Gladwyn would occasionally caE at Madame- 
des Ruisseaux's, at whose house on Ste. Anne's- 
street Madeleine resided, and he would try and 
soothe the ladies' apprehensions. For the times- 
were critical, and it required a brave and cour- 
ageous heart to witness the fearful sights of 
which they were powerless spectators. Ghostly 
processions of massacred captives would float 
down on the river past the fort during the day, 
while night was robbed of its darkness by the 
fire-rafts sent by the wily Indian to destroy the- 
two small vessels, the only hope of the beleaguer- 
ed garrison. Gradually Gladwyn' s visits became- 
more frequent, and it was soon evident that the 
English officer found his chief pleasure and 
forgot his precarious position in the smiles of 
the beautiful Madeleine. She was flattered by 
his attentions, and his society beguiled many an 
anxious hour. But when he laid his heart at her 
disposal she turned a deaf ear to his entreaties.

becoming more distant in her intercourse witli 
him. Possessing a nature not easily balked in 
its purpose, he determined to find the cause of 
his rejection, and leave no means unturned to 
secure her. 

Matters stood thus when one sultry July day, 
Godefroy returning, reported himself to Gladwyn. 
He was well received by the officer, though he 
brought news of the ill success of his mission. 
Gladwyn then spoke of his affection for Mile, de 
Tonnancour, and tried to enlist the sympathy of 
Godefroy and his influence with his beautiful 
relative, holding forth promises of interest, etc. 
Godefroy, much surprised, refused, but couched 
his reply in terms as courteous as possible, Glad- 
wyn' s determined character being well known. He 
spoke also of the enmity which he would incur 
from Madeleine' s relatives, who might think he 
had thus purchased advancement. Gladwyn 
turned haughtily away, saying something which 
roused the blood of the Frenchman, who, forget- 
ting the habitual prudence and policy used by the 
habitants in their intercourse -with the English, 
made a bitter retort and left the officer' s quarters. 
That same evening Gladwyn penned an epistle to 
Sir William Johnson in which he made a most 
sweeping assertion, imputing to the French, and 



108 Legends of Le Detroit. 

particularly to Godefroy and Ms friends, the 
blame for the Indian outbreak. 

On Grodefroy's return to his sister's, he re- 
marked that he would have to be cautious and 
be ready to leave the fort at a moment' s warning, 
for, said he, "I noticed from the glitter of the 
Major's steel gray eyes that mischief is in store 
for me," and related the interview with Grladwyn. 

Poor Madeleine was in despair feeling as if she 
was born under an unlucky star to bring mis- 
fortune upon all, and kept secluded for sev- 
eral days. One evening at twilight tired of the 
house she determined to stroll out. Passing the 
water-gate she sauntered towards the Rigolet 
des Hurons (Savoyard) that flowed back of the 
pickets. On its sloping banks was a stately oak, 
within whose hollow trunk a pious hand had 
placed an image of the Yirgin, for the spot was 
pointed out by tradition as the place where the 
saintly Father Constantin had been murdered 
many years before. As she walked along she 
noticed the new moon over her right shoulder ‚Äî a 
lucky omen, she thought ‚Äî and remembered that 
in the morning whilst sadly musing on her mis- 
fortunes a little wren,* the bird " au Bon Dieu," 

*This bird was fabled to have brought fire from Heaven to 
‚ñ†earth. He brings good fortune, and he who tears down his nest 
Ijrings the fire of Heaven on his own household.

had come to build its nest under her dormer 
window. 

We are prismatic in our nature and reflect 
every varying mood of our surroundings. Can 
it be wondered at, that those brought up in the 
wild, half savage life of the frontier, caught that 
tinge of the supernatural which hides in the 
heart of primeval forests, blends itself in the 
myths of the Indians, and appeals to that super- 
stition which lurks in every heart, investing 
each freak of nature, every unusual occurrence, 
vsdth an occult and mystic meaning? Thus, to 
one of Madeleine's temperament, nature could 
never be mute. Should a little flake of snow 
suddenly dart across her path, it was the soul of 
an unbaptized infant, she thought, condemned 
to wander. If a white pigeon flew near and 
was exceptionally tame, it was the soul of some 
departed friend for whose repose she had forgot- 
ten to pray. The cheerful cricket on the hearth 
must be welcomed, for he brought joy and peace ; 
the little swallow could always bring you a stone 
that would restore sight to the blind, and any 
young girl whose heart was pure could, by 
touching the flower marigold with her bare, dim- 
pled foot, on a certain night, understand the 
language of birds. Nor did the fair maiden 
shriek out when the industrious spider, whose 



110 Legends of le Detroit 

‚ñ†web extended across the ancient rafters, dropped 
on her plump neck, for it was a sign of money 
coming. And whosoever heard the first cuckoo 
of spring singing was sure to keep safe what 
money he possessed the rest of the year. Made- 
leine knelt before the humble shrine and besought 
her Heavenly Mother to obtain from her Divine 
Son guidance out of her troubles. 

With a lighter heart she rose from her devo- 
tions and turned her steps homeward. Suddenly 
a hooting owl flew past her, muttering its dismal 
sound, and the distant mournful notes of a toll- 
ing bell fell on her ear. A prophetic feeling of 
impending woe seized her. Ere she had time to 
analyze the sensation the cannon of the fort 
thundered forth and was instantly answered by 
a salute from the water. 

Hastening her steps she saw coming up the 
xiver a long line of batteaux crowded with men, 
proclaiming that at last the expected relief had 
come. The troops landed and were warmly wel- 
comed by the garrison, and she heard the name 
of Dalzell,* which fell like a bright ray on the 
‚ñ†dark drapery of her forebodings. As soon as 
Dalzell learnt that Madeleine was in the fort, 
accompanied by Gladwyn he sought her presence. 
The blushing cheek and gladsome light which 

* Dalzell is pronounced Dalyell. 



Legends of Le Detroit. Ill 

lighted up the dark eye revealed to the Com- 
mandant why he had pleaded in vain. He soon 
took his leave, and Madeleine laid her troubles 
before her lover. " We shall now put an end to 
aU this," he answered. "I have three hundred 
veterans, and with the Major's permission will 
soon demonstrate the folly of remaining here 
pent up at the behest of the savages." "Alas ! " 
replied she, "you know not the oraft nor the 
power of this Indian chieftain. Besides, I have 
‚ñ†‚ñ†a, strange presentiment that if you undertake so 
hazardous a project we shall never meet again." 
In vain he tried with all a soldier's ardor added 
"to a lover's tenderness, to lull her fears ; but a 
vague, inexplicable something seemed to warn 
her that this was their last meeting on earth. 

The graphic pen of history has chronicled the 
result and verified the girl' s apprehensions ‚Äî how 
"the consent of Gladwyn was apparently reluc- 
tantly given ; the early march at dawn of Dajzell 
and his men to Pontiac's camp ; the ambuscade 
i}hat he feU- into, and how the waters of Bloody 
Run were crimsoned by the blood of his brave 
:soldiers ; and finally the heroic death of the gal- 
lant Dalzell in trying to save a wounded comrade. 
"When the terrible news was brought to Made- 
leine she nobly dried her tears while trying to 
alleviate the sufferings of the wounded which 



112 Legends of Le Detroit. 

each boat brought to the fort. Overhearing some 
one say that Dalzell's head was placed on a picket, 
she lost consciousness, and ere many days had 
passed had joined her lover in a better land. 
Gladwyn seemed ever after like one on whose 
mind some great burden of sorrow was resting. 
His bitterness towards the French increased, and 
on Bradstreet' s arrival Godefroy was found under 
arrest and condemned to death by a court martial 
on the grounds of having incited the Indians to 
revolt. He was released on condition of acting 
as interpreter to an English officer, whose expe- 
dition to the Illinois country probably saved the 
British army from destruction. 

The stately tree on Jeiferson avenue known as 
the Pontiac Oak, is all that is left to remind one 
of that bloody romance ; the stream itself has 
disappeared.

LE LOUP GAROTJ. 



A liegeud of Grosse Fointe. 



ANY years before Com- 
modore Grant, formerly in 
command of a British ves- 
sel on Lake Erie* built his 
great castle at Grosse 
Pointe, a trapper named 
Simonet had settled near 
there on the margin of the lake. 

His young wife had faded away in the early 
years of their married life, but as if in compen- 
sation, had left the little prattler Archange to 
wean him from his grief and to cheer his lone- 
liness. And the strong, hardy man, with his 




*Erie in the Huron language signifies cat. 



114 Legends of Le Detroit. 

sunburnt face and brawny arms hardened by 
toil and exposure, in his yearning love for his 
child, learned to soften his rough manners and 
soothe her with the gentle ways of a woman. 
Anxiously he watched the unfolding of his 
"pretty flower," as he called her, and with a 
solicitude touching in its simple pathos, he would 
select the softest skin of the bear to keep her feet 
warm, search for the brightest wings of the bird 
to adorn her hat. When she grew up he taught 
her to skin the beaver, muskrat and deer which 
he brought home, and to stretch them out on the 
drying frame near the house. He was wont to 
boast that no one could excel Archange preparing 
the poisson blanc (whitefish), poisson dore (pick- 
erel), or give that peculiar shade of brown which 
is in itself an art, to the savory cochon au lait 
{sucking pig). 

She was as light-hearted as the cricket that 
chirped on the hearth, and her cheery voice could 
be heard caroling away to the music of her spin- 
ning wheel. In the long winter evenings her deft 
fingers would plait the straw into hats which 
found a ready sale, and which, added to the sum 
she gained by her knitted socks and dried corn, 
enabled her to secure many little articles that her 
vanity suggested to enhance her charms. For 
the Canadian girl, in the rude surroundings of 



Legends of Le Detroit. 115 

her forest home, was as anxious to please and be 
witch by her toilet as her more favored Parisian 
sister ; the instincts of the sex still lived in the 
wilderness. At the corn-huskings and dances 
on the greensward Archange was the reigning 
belle, and held her little conrt of home-spun 
‚Ä¢dressed youths fascinated by the magic of her 
‚ñ†dark eyes, her brunette complexion with its warm 
glow, her raven tresses and piquante tongue. 
Many admiring eyes followed her lithe form as 
she tripped in marvelous rapidity " la jig a deux, ' ' 
or as she changed into the more graceful, sway- 
ing motion of "la dance ronde. ' ' 

Pierre La Fontaine, a young farmer, wooed the 
fair Archange, and the light of happiness which 
crept into the dark, vdnsome eyes shyly raised to 
his in answer, told him he had not pleaded in 
vain. Simonet gave his consent and blessed them, 
rejoicing in the happiness of his child. On bright 
moonlight nights Pierre would come to take his 
fair fiancee out for a row. Impelled by his sin- 
ewy arm, merrily would the fragile canoe dance 
along on the rippling waters lit up by elfish moon- 
beams, and the lovers would talk about the wed- 
ding, which was soon to take place, for Pierre's 
new cabin that he was building for his ' ' bonnie 
bride" was nearly completed, almost a mile dis- 
tant from his father' s, where the willows stooped 



116 Legends of Le Detroit. 

so low that their graceful tresses touched the 
water. Archange would tell him of the red cow 
her god-father had promised her, and the addi- 
tions to their humble menage her god-mother had 
made.* 

One evening as Pierre placed Archange on the 
beach near her home and she lingered, following- 
him with her loving eyes as he swiftly rowed 
away until he had disappeared and only the faint 
echo of his Canadian boat song floated towards 
her, she was startled by a rustling sound near by. 
Looking up a wild shriek escaped her, for a mon- 
ster with a wolfs head and an enormous tail, 
walking erect as a human being, crossed her path. 
Quickly the cabin door was thrown open by Sim- 
onet, who had been roused by his daughter's 
scream. Archange flew into her father's arms 
and pointed to the spot where she had seen the 
monster, but the animal surprised by the light, 
had fled into the woods. Simonet's face grew 
pale as Archange described, as accurately as her 
fears had allowed her to see, the apparition, and 
he recognized the dreaded Loup Garou.f He 

*It was customary for the god-mother to give the bride the 
necessary articles for a bedroom, hence the term "la chambre 
garni " (the furnished room), " le lit garni " (the furnished bed). 

f The term Loup Garou. Its Latin equivalent in the Middle 
Age was gerulphus. The German wer-wolf and English were- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 117 

‚Ä¢quieted her, and soon with the happy faculty- 
youth has of forgetting disagreeable things she 
was dreaming of Pierre and her wedding. Long 
after the girl slept Simonet sat musing. He lit 
his pipe seeking companionship in his thoughts. 
That it was the Loup Garou or wehr-wolf Ar- 
change had seen he did not doubt, and he recalled 
aU the traditions of his youth, how the dreaded 
monster had stolen young children ; sometimes a 
young man would be inveigled away into the for- 
est and never heard of afterwards, and his fate 
conjectured by some, having seen the wolf dressed 
in his clothes. It was for young maidens he 

wolf have the same meaning. Oservais de Tilbury in his Oisior- 
tes Imperiales gives the followmg explanation: "We have fre- 
quently seen in England," says he, "under the influence of cer- 
tain conditions, men transformed into wolves, species of men 
called by the French garous (gerulphus), and the English, were- 
wolf." Were in English signifies man, and wolf, loup ‚Äî man-wolf. 
In Longfellow's Evangeline the following relative to the Loup 
iGarou and other old Norman superstitions is found : 

"He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children. 
For he told them tales of the Loup Garou in the forest. 
And of the goblin thai came in the night to water the horses. 
And of the White Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchris- 

tened 
Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of chil- 
dren. 
And how on Christmas Eve the oxen talked in the stable. 
And how the fever was cured by a spidei; shut up in a nut- 
shell, 
And of the marvelous powers of four-leaved clovers and 

horse-shoes. 
With whatever else was writ in the lore of the village." 



118 Legends of Le Detroit. 

showed the greatest fondness, and "it boded no 
good to her whose path he crossed." Several at- 
tempts had been made to kill the beast, yet all 
failed and it was thought he bore a charmed life. 
But one adventurous hunter determined to try 
his skill, so he molded a bullet from silver coin 
and patiently waited for his victim "to cross his 
path." The charmed missile sped towards its 
destination and instead of killing the monster 
only severed his tail, which was secured, dried 
and stuffed. It was the wonder of the whole 
country, and was worshiped for years by the 
Indians as a powerful fetich. Simonet hoped all 
would be well, still a strange feeling came over 
him like a presentiment, which in vain he tried 
to shake off. 

The wedding day at last dawned, the sun 
shone brightly and all nature seemed to smile on 
the fair bride of that day. Archange, arrayed 
in her simple dress of white batiste, was a 
charming picture of innocence and beauty. Go- 
ing into the woods to gather her bouquet of wild 
flowers, "the Garou again crossed her path," but 
this time she forgot her fears in her sense of the 
ludicrous at the figure of the beast, which had 
robbed some habitant of his coat and hat, and 
had carefully tucked his tail away. In his hand 
he held a cane, which he twisted in a nonchalant 



Legends of Le Detroit. 119 

manner ; he was a fair caricature of a Parisian 
dandy. Seeing she did not fly in terror, he was 
encouraged to give her a lovesick leer displaying 
his wolfish tongue and teeth. Scattering her 
flowers, Archange fled and arrived breathlessly 
home Just in time to slam the door on the wolf, 
which had pursued her there. 

Soon after she joined Pierre and hand in hand, 
followed by all the habitants in their holiday 
attire, they entered the little church of logs hewn 
square, the interstices chinked in with clay, the 
roof of overlapping strips of bark. In front of 
the altar, decorated with flowers arranged by lov- 
ing hands, they knelt. Father Freshet, who had 
baptized Pierre and Archange and prepared them 
for their first communion, now came to unite them 
in the holy bonds of matrimony. After the cere- 
mony they went to the sacristy and inscribed 
their names in the registry, then hurried ofE to 
Pierre' s new house, where the festivities were to 
take place. On the green lawn in front of her 
new cabin the blushing Archange greeted all her 
friends. The Seigneur of the neighborhood came 
to claim the right of premier baiser (first kiss). 
The refreshments were in abundance and all gave 
themselves up to the enjoyment of the moment, 
for the Canadians dearly loved a wedding and 
kept up its festivities for days. 



120 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Whilst the merry making was at its height the 
dreaded Garou with a rush like the wind sprang 
into their midst, seized Archange and escaped 
with her into the forest. All were paralyzed by 
the sudden, daring deed. But Pierre recovering, 
started in quick pursuit guided by the despairing 
cry of Archange, followed by all the men, whilst 
the women and children said their prayers and 
gave vent to loud lamentations. Long after the 
shadows had fallen they returned to report to the 
anxious, trembling crowd, and their sad, dejected 
faces spoke of the fruitlessness of their search. 
The monster had baffled them. But Pierre rev 
turned not. He was shortly after found by his 
friends wandering around and around a swamp, 
and clutching a piece of white batiste. When 
questioned as to how he had obtained this clue to 
Archange, he returned a maniacal stare and with 
a blood-curdling shriek, would have jximped into 
the swamp if he had not been held back by his 
companions, who with sorrowful accents said " La 
folie du bois."* He would always return to the 
same swamp, remaining there for hours gazing 
vacantly in the weird reflections of its slimy, stag- 
nant waters, until some friend led him home. 

*La folie du bois (the folly of the woods) alludes to the well- 
known insane tendency which prompts those lost in the woods to 
go round in a continuous circle, instead of following a direct 
path which would lead to a clearing. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 121 

At the marriage of his sister, which occurred 
‚Ä¢about a year afterwards, Pierre, always dead to 
the outside world, seemed to be roused by the 
preparations. After the ceremony he rushed into 
the woods as if in pursuit of something. He did 
not return until nearly sunset when he was seen, 
with wild eyes, flying hair, his clothes torn as if 
lay briers, chasing a Loup Garou to the very edge 
‚Ä¢of the lake. All stood petrified by the strange 
.apparition and feared a repetition of Archange's 
fate. But the animal, seeing no escape, stood on 
one of the boulders strewn along the shore and 
stretched out his arms as if beckoning to some 
mysterious one. A large catfish was seen to rise 
‚ñ†on the surface of the water and opening its mouth 
the Loup Garou vanished ; and to this day no 
Canadian will eat catfish. The footprint of the 
vrolf is still shown at Grosse Pointe indelibly im- 
pressed on one of the boulders. 




THE OLD RED MILL. 



A Iiegrend of the ¬£ng'lish Kule. 

IN" THE former district of Springwells (at thef 
foot of 24tlL street), of the present city of De- 
troit, in 1795, stood an old red mill. It was- 
circular in form, and had a stone foundation sup- 
porting an upright wooden body, with a conical 
roof. 

It was a weird sight on a moonlight night with 
its long arms stretched out as if beseeching- 
aid, and its tattered sails drooping mournfully 
telling its melancholy story like a flag at half- 
mast. The beholder involuntarily felt that creep- 
ing shudder of awe which contact with the myste-

beings upon which nature places her signet,; ‚Äî a 
history. 

The Indian, as he returned from his day' s hunt- 
ing, laden with the trophies of his skill, pushed 
his canoe out into the stream far from its shadow. 
The gay, joyous voices in the pleasure boats of 
the officers of Fort Lenoult were hushed as they 
silently glided by, and the coureur des bois whO' 
had faced untold dangers, devoutly crossed him- 
self as the old red mill rose in view on his return 
from his distant and perilous expeditions. On 
vdnter evenings, under the genial warmth of a 
hickory log and the soothing influence of his ci- 
dre au charbon, the old habitant would tell to his 
children, who listened with bated breath, the 
legend of the old red mill. 

Many years before, when the English under Col. 
Rogers, had taken possession of Detroit, there- 
lived at the mill a Canadian family who had 
adopted a daughter of the tribe of Pontiac. Sh&amp; 
was beloved by a British officer, but belonging tO' 
the Ottawas whose haughty chief was disposed to 
resist the new comers, and residing among the 
French who looked suspiciously at the invaders,

would be ratified (a suspicion which subsequent 
events proved not without cause), it is not to be-

‚ñ†supposed that the course of true love could run 
smoothly. Yet love, which laughs in the face of 
all danger and is prolific in resources, soon found 
.a means by which the lovers could meet. It was 
agreed upon by them that a signal should be giv- 
‚Ä¢en when there was no danger of a surprise, ‚Äî a 
lighted candle to be placed in her window ; quick- 
ly then would the officer obey the summons of 
his lady love. 

Wasson,* a warrior of the Saginaws, allies of 
Pontiac, had long loved the fair maiden and had 
laid at her feet the trophies of the chase, but the 
Indian girl saw them not, nor heard his pleadings, 
lor her ears yearned for the sound of another 
voice whose soft accents had nestled in her heart 
like hushed music. Wounded by his rejection, 
the brave sought the cause, found it, and courted 
revenge as his companion. Watching his oppor- 
tunity when the girl was alone, he upbraided hesr 
ior having forgotten her duties as an Indian 
maiden and for deserting the traditions of her 
race, and raising his tomahawk told her that she 
‚ñ†should pay the penalty of her treason with her 
life. As the savage's arm descended the girl sank 
‚ñ†deluged in her blood. The Indian had not com- 
pleted the sacrifice ; one more victim his revenge 
‚Ä¢demanded. He lighted the candle, the secret of 

*A noted warrior, Wasson or Warsong. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 125' 

wMch he had learned, and patiently waited. 
Splashing oars and a low, cautious call soon told 
him that the lover had obeyed the beacon of love. 
The savage glutted over his success and waited 
breathlessly with weapon poised to hurl at his in- 
tended victim as he opened the door, when sud- 
denly other footsteps were heard proclaiming the' 
return of the family. In the general confusion 
which ensued on the discovery of the murder the- 
Indian slipped away unnoticed, balked for the 
time of half of his revenge. The lifeless remains, 
of the lovely victim were tenderly laid to rest. 
The oJBBLcer sought in the busy strife of the period 
to forget his grief, but the Indian' s revenge only 
slumbered, and shortly afterwards the officer was- 
basely murdered by him while he was detained 
as a hostage at Pontiac's camp at Bloody Run.* 
The mill was afterwards deserted, but the lone- 
ly wayfarer who passed there at night whispered 
strange stories of its being haunted by an Indiaiu 
maiden who stood at a window with a lighted 
candle.

LA CHASSE GALERIE. 



A Legend of the Canadian Store. 

THERE is a strange resemblance in the legends 
of the different countries which, leads one to 
believe that they derive their source from the 
same fountain. History places its signet on 
some, mythology throws its classic veil over oth- 
ers, while the rest, like floating islands which 
ever and anon appear as bits of stray fairy-land 
in our large bodies of water, dazzle us by their 
beauty, charm us by their uniqueness, and glide 
away as magically as they came, to seek a shel- 
tered nook in some picturesque haven. So with 
regard to many of these legends once current 
along "La Cote du Nord"* history is silent. 

* " La Cote du Nord." The name by which that section lying 
‚Ä¢east of what is now Woodward avenue was called. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 127 

The charming ideas conveyed in them seem akin 
to the classic, but it is only in the memory of 
^ome old habitante who has outlived her age and 
generation that they find a revered niche. Seated 
by the side of one of these, whose hair the frosts 
" ‚Ä¢of ninety years have bleached, and who has never 
left the banks of the beautiful lake where she 
first drew the breath of life, one can pick up 
many of these legends, carelessly thrown aside 
by this progressive age. 

Among the traditions related by this survivor 
of a past generation, the best known and oldest 
is that of "La Chasse Galerie," or " The Spectral 
Aerial Hunt." Many honest, upright people still 
living will testify to having seen this phenomenon 
at some period of their lives. It does not always 
.appear under the same form. Sometimes a canoe 
is visible, manned by twelve men, and in its prow 
is a dog whose incessant barking attracts the at- 
tention or the person who is to see the vision. 
Always to the north flies the phantom boat. At 
other times, dogs of a shaggy black, with droop- 
ing ears, are constantly seen running on the 
water, barking as if in the scent of game. Once 
in seven years a solitary horseman, with gaunt, 
bronzed face, rifle in hand, followed by his pack 
of dogs, is seen in the sky after sunset. He who 



128 Legends of Le Detroit. 

sees the ' ' chasse galerie ' ' * knows that it betokens 
death either to himself or to others dear to him. 

There once dwelt at Askin Pointe, on the Cana- 
dian shore, a Nimrod of the forest called Sebas- 
tien Lacelle. So devoted to the chase was he 
that his friends said that he was born with a gun 
in his hand, and no persuasion of theirs could 
induce him to join them in other sports. For 
weeks at a time he would be gone, and then 
return laden with game. After one of these ex- 
cursions it was noticed that Sebastien was more 
silent than usual, had little to say of his hair- 
breadth escapes, nor did he boast, as was his 
wont, of the fruits of his trusty rifle. 

The mystery was soon solved. One day, tired 
and weary, baffled by a deer he was pursuing, 
Sebastien came to a cabin in the woods. A 
young girl was caressing a deer and deftly dress- 
ing a wound in its side. Sebastien recognized it 
as the one at which he had shot. She was Zoe 
de Mersac, who had accompanied her father to 
help him extract the maple syrup from the trees. 
In the magic witchcraft of her smile Sebastien 
buried his heart. Zoe admired the strong arm 
and the vigorous manhood which could shield 
her from the rough blasts of the world. 

* Galerie is a corruption of galere, a low, flat built vessel with 
one deck, and propelled by sails or oars. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 129' 

It was on a glorious September day that Sebas- 
tien and Zoe were strolling along the beach, 
discussing the morrow, which was to be their 
wedding day. Zoe was possessed of a highly 
nervous organization which, like the iEolian harp, 
is played upon by each passing zephyr, and is- 
peculiarly susceptible to superstition. She was 
telling her lover how she feared her happiness 
could not last and spoke of that serrement du coeur 
which seemed prophetic of evil. Sebastien, in 
the superb enjoyment of his healthy physique, 
could not sympathize with her, and only laughed 
at her fears. 

What had presentiments to do with him, he 
thought ; would he not be obliged to relinquish hi&amp; 
bachelor habits and become a serious, home-stay 
ing man? An unconscious sigh escaped him. 
Raising his eyes, he abruptly left Zoe. He re- 
turned shortly afterwards accompanied by several 
men, guns in hand, whom he had called from the 
"seines" near by, and followed by Sebastien' s 
dog, Chasseur. Whilst his friends were loosening 
the boat from its moorings Sebastien joined his 
fiancee who asked him to explain the cause of 
his sudden departure. He pointed to a flock of 
ducks flying towards the flats ( an unusual occur- 
rence at that season ) and said he was going for 
a farewell hunt. As soon as she heard this she

Md her face in her hands, and the slender, girlish 
figure was convulsed. In accents tremulous with 
unshed tears, she besought him not to leave her, 
for if he did, he would never return. Sebastien 
tried to reason with her, but it was of no avail. 
He petted her and tried those arts in which the 
lover is so proficient. She told him that she had 
heard the past night the screech-owl in the wil- 
low tree near her window, at the same time the 
barking of dogs and ringing of bells in the air ‚Äî ‚ñ† 
‚ñ†doleful foreshadowings of approaching disaster. 

Sebastien gazed tenderly into the upturned 
face, so pathetic in its tearful appeal, and felt his 
resolve melting away. But the impatient call of 
his friends and a shy feeling of being laughed 
at prompted him to hastily say good-bye to his 
promised bride. "When shall you return?" 
asked Zoe. "To-morrow at dawn, dead or alive, 
sure," he jestingly added, to quiet her fears. 
Soon the hunters were off. Sebastien waved the 
end of his red sash and Chasseur barked a jubi- 
lant farewell, for he seemed to share his master' s 
love of the chase. 

At early dawn Zoe came to the shore to wel- 
come the returning hunters. She seated herself 
on one of the great boulders which are strewn 
upon the Shores of the lake, thrown there by the 
Indian spirit Manabozbo, who cast them at his 



Legends of Le Detroit 131 

lather in his memorable combat. Seldom had so 
glorious a scene burst on her view and all was in 
harmony with her nature. The dark forests 
melted with azure softness, the magical veil of 
misty golden haziness hung over everything, 
transforming the scene into a sea of gold dissolved 
in rainbow tints. Lake, sky, land, all seemed 
flooded and transfigured. ' The indescribable 
shades flowed into each other with a beauty 
which, while enchanting, was the despair of the 
artist. The girl drank in the delicious draught of 
loveliness, and thought if this was the dawn of a 
perfect earthly day which must die in all its splen- 
dor, what must be that of the eternal one in its 
undying beauty. To-day was her wedding day ! 
Why did Sebastien tarry ? Had he not a loving 
impatience to meet his bride ? Hour after hour 
she waited, sending forth her petitions to Ste. 
Anne, the patroness of mariners, to guide her 
Sebastien back. Others whose husbands and 
brothers had gone with Sebastien joined her in 
her weary watchings. Night came but brought 
no returning hunters. Day after day Zoe still 
came to the beach, questioning the vast waters 
and the horizon for Sebastien. Winter passed, 
spring again hung her bright blossoms on the 
trees, but Sebastien came not to gladden the 
the sorrow-haunted heart of the girl. Yet she 



132 Legends of Le Detroit. 

seemed, cheerful, as if buoyed up by some inward 
hope. She constantly said, that her lover would 
return to claim her, ‚Äî he had promised and he 
had never deceived any one. Once, shortly after 
he left, she had heard Sebastien's voice, and look- 
ing up saw him in a boat in the clouds. Chas- 
seur was with him, and Sebastien said : "I will 
come for you in a year and a day." Then to- 
wards the north the mystic apparition glided and 
the voice died away in the moaning wind. 

It was a year and a day. The pale cheek with 
its hectic flush, the fragile figure, the transparent 
hand told that this was a blossom for the grave. 

Zoe desired that she should be dressed as a 
bride and carried to the beach to watch for her 
bridegroom. Her chair was brought to the place 
she designated. The scene was by a strange co- 
incidence of nature, nearly the same as on the 
bright day she waited Sebastien' s return. Nature 
seemed anxious that the dying girl should take 
the sweetest and most beautiful memories of 
earth with her. The wakening waves chanted 
their low matins as they broke at her feet, the 
birds greeted her with jubilant notes and the 
soft, balmy air played hide and seek through the 
meshes of her hair. 

The maiden heeded not the beauty of the 
scene; her eyes were intently fixed on a spot, in 



Legends of Le Detroit. 133 

tlie skies. Suddenly an ecstatic expession crept 
over her face, and raising herself up she ex- 
claimed, "See! see! there is Sebastien in the 
boat ; he beckons to me, and Chasseur is barking 
so joyously ! Did I not tell you he would come 
for me? Sebastien, I come, I come." And the 
pure spirit of the girl leaped from its mortal 
tenement to rejoin that of her spirit bride- 
groom. Her awe-stricken friends looked where 
she pointed and saw a phantom boat drifting on 
a billow of clouds, and distinctly heard the echo 
of a barking dog as the vision melted into the 
boundless blue.

LE FBTJ FOLLET. 



A Leg:end¬∞of Grrosse Isle. 




BOUT fifteen miles below De-

its wonderful fertility, the luxuriant growth of 
its forest trees and the beauty of its situation so 
wove the spell of [its seductive charm around the 
heart of an English officer, that he resolved to re- 
sign and spend the remainder of his days in this 
enchanting retreat. His name was William Ma- 
comb. He was of Scottish extraction, and he had 
come to Detroit with the English troops in 1760. 
Macomb obtained an Indian grant for his coveted 



Legends of Le Detroit. 135 

treasure, and soon improvements arose, testifying 
Ms earnest desire to make himself comfortable in 
Ms island home. In 1808 his heirs, John, Wil- 
liam and David, through their attorney, Solo- 
mon Sibley, and their agent, Angus Mcintosh, re- 
ceived full acknowledgment from the American 
Government. Energy, enterprise and adminis- 
trative ability were inseparable from the name of 
Macomb, one of its members, Alexander, be- 
coming general-in-chief of the army of the 
United States. Grrosse Isle, Belle Isle,* and 
large tracts of land in Detroit, belonged to this 
family, and if retained until the present time 
would have made them immensely wealthy. 
The lavish hospitality and unbounded extrava- 
gance which characterized aU the old families 
during the military epoch, compelled a gradual 
transfer of property. But some of the descendants, 
though no longer bearing the family name, still 
preserve homesteads on Grosse Isle. 

* See page 273 and page 479 Land Titles in the Michigan Terri- 
tory American State Papers xvi., vol. 1, Public Lands. 

Monday, December 3, 1805. 

John, William and David Macomb claimed an island situated 
in the Strait, three miles above Detroit, called Hog Island. It con- 
tains 704 acres, was surveyed by Mr. Boyd in 1771, and purchased 
from the Indians of the Ottawa and Chippewa nations in council, 
under direction of his- Majesty's commander-in-chief, and con- 
veyed to Lt. George McDougall, whose heirs sold it to Wm. Ma- 
comb in 1793. 



136 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Cotemporary with the Macombs was the family 
of the Navarres. Robert 1st of the name, was 
fifth in descent from Antoine, Duke of Vendome, 
half-brother of Henry 4th of JSTavarre. He came 
to Detroit in 1730 as sub-intendant of Louis XIY, 
having entire control of all the affairs of the 
French Grovernment outside of the military au- 
thority, in this part of la Nouvelle France. His 
children and grandchildren became an honor to 
him, and proverbial for their great beauty and 
Bourbon faces. They so married and intermar- 
ried with the Macombs, that it was difficult to 
say where one family ended and the other began. 

William Macomb, Jr., had become the humble 
captive of the beautiful Monique Navarre, a 
granddaughter of "Robert the Writer," as he 
was called. He had invited her with her brother 
Robert, to visit the island during the sultry Au- 
gust weather, and one morning they embarked in 
their little sailboat to drink in the refreshing 
breezes from Lake Erie. On landing before the 
Macomb mansion they were disappointed to learn 
that the family had been called to Elba Island, 
Just below, by the death of a friend, but the 
" pani "*. slave left in attendance assured them 

*At tbe time referred to slavery was universal, and orginally 
all prisoners taken in Indian wars, wlio were not whites, were called

ithey must come in and make themselves comfort- 
able, as Master William had left word, thinking 
it possible that the visitors would come, that he 
would reach home by sunset. The aspect of the 
:sky silenced all hesitancy, as one of those sudden 
storms born only on a sultry, tropical day, swept 
‚ñ†over the island. 

As the vivid flashes darted across the water, 
Monique, who was of a nervous temperament, 
begged the pani slave to split off fragments of the 
‚ñ†Christmas log (usually preserved half -burnt from 
year to year) and to throw them on the fire, " to 
3)revent the thunder from falling;" then, glanc- 
ing at the door and seeing a branch of white 
thorn suspended there she became tranquil. This 
bush was considered a divine lightning rod, the 
superstition probably arising from the fact that 
its thorny branches crowned the Saviour's head. 
An old legend says that wherever drops of His 
precious blood fell, flowers sprang forth. A por- 
tion of this crown is still seen in the relics of the 
Holy Roman Empire in the government collection 
at Yienna.* 

pronunciation, "Pawnee." The world gradually came to mean a 
person of mixed Indian and negro blood, and is so used in this 

narrative. 

* Another superstition was that a piece of bread which had been 
"blessed at three Christmas masses would preserve a house from 
Jharm. 



138 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Gradually the storm subsided, but the shadows- 
of night crept swiftly on and still the family re- 
turned not. Suddenly a sharp, shrill whistle fell 
on the expectant ears, startling all to their feet. 
Monique, who had been gazing vaguely into the 
twilight, slammed the blinds together hurriedly 
exclaiming, " It is the feu f oUet dancing over the- 
fields, and if I had not shut it out, it would have 
entered and strangled us. Le Bon Dieu preserve 
"William and the others." 

"A truce to your fears, ma scEur," answered 
Robert. ' ' They can take care of themselves, but 
as it is clearing up we will soon go in search of 
them." Thus did he soothe the nervous girl ; for 
himself he had no fears, and being a student at 
the bar, naturally felt little respect for the higher 
powers or the devil. 

Like other scoffers of the period he thought 
the feu f oUet merely inflammable gases arising- 
from miasmatic exhalations of swampy lands. 
Monique and many others thought this " an easy 
way of explaining it. ' ' Had they lived in our days- 
they would have found a great number who attrib- 
ute to electricity things which they can not ex- 
plain. 

"Tell me all about the feu foUet, chere 
scBur," said Robert, anxious to divert her and 
lull her apprehensions. A glad light of pleasure- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 139' 

stole into her eyes, and a tender blush suffused 
her face, battling with that triumphant expres- 
sion which every woman wears when she thinks 
she has won a convert to her opinions. 

"Monfrere, the feu follet are not always con- 
sidered dangerous. When twin lights are seen 
stealing along in the soft twilight they are called 
'Castijr and Pollux,' and this is a happy omen. 
But when a single intense light appears it is- 
named 'Helene,' and he who sees it must at once 
throw himself on the ground covering his face,, 
for so seductive is its fascination that it allures 
him to deserted bogs and steep ravines, and leaves 
him to die. There is a Norman tradition which 
exists among the habitants coming from Caen, in 
Normandy, that the feu follet are divided into 
two species, the male and female, and are sup- 
posed to be the souls of those who have sinned 
against purity. These people of the ISTorman race 
also call maidens who have fallen from grace ' f ou- 
rolle,' as fourolle Jeanne, fourolle Katishe, and 
believe that the evil one gives them the power of 
divesting themselves of their body, and transform- 
ing into a bright light which runs 'en fourolle,' 
leading many to destruction who mistake it for 
some friendly signal when astray in swampy 
places." 

As Monique finished her explanation she rose 



140 Legends of Le Detroit. 

and insisted that they should go in search of the 
host and family. They started out followed by 
the pani, who held his blazing pine knot which 
threw its uncertain light on the pathway and 
made a weird tableau as its flickering rays alter- 
nately bathed the little procession in light, then 
in shadow. They made the woods resound with 
their shouts, but no answering call greeted their 
anxious ears, and the pani expressed his anx- 
iety, as "Master William had surely promised 
to return, and he never knew him to fail in spite 
of rain or sunshine." At last, as they proceeded 
‚Ä¢on their doleful journey, the ground grew miry 
and swampy, while the dismal croaking of frogs 
and the sickly miasmatic odors added to their 
dread forebodings. Just then, when the saddest 
presentiments were invading the hearts of the 
courageous searchers, MonicLue uttered one last 
despairing cry in which all the energy of her na- 
ture seemed centered, so anxious was she it should 
reach the lost one. Instantaneously the sharp 
report of a pistol startled from their nests the 
little birds which fluttered around chirping plain- 
tively, as if seeking companionship from the 
invaders of their solitary and mournful abode. 
Following the sound of the pistol, the searchers 
:saw in the swamp an object in the water, and 
^oon their willing hands had made a sort of 



Legends of Le Detroit. 141 

bridge wMcli enabled them to approach it. It 
proved to be the lost wanderer, hopelessly strug- 
gling in the miry embrace. He was extricated 
from his perilous position and the little proces- 
sion went back rejoicing. 

On arriving at home, seated at the hospitable 
table, William related his adventure. As soon 
as the storm subsided he had started homeward ;. 
the remainder of the family were to stay at 
Elba until the morning. In the darkness he had 
lost his way, and seeing a bright light had fol- 
lowed it. As he drew nearer it appeared to- 
recede until he found himself plunged into the 
swamp. He cried out for help until exhausted, 
and his only answer was the mocking laughter of 
goblins. Realizing the hopelessness of his posi- 
tion, he commended his spirit to his Maker and 
calmly awaited the result. Suddenly it seemed 
to him as if the voice of his loved one was borne 
to his ears to soften the anguish of his last mo- 
ments. Then other voices came so distinctly that 
he awoke from his lethargy, and thinking it pos- 
sible that friends had heard his former cries for 
help, fired his pistol. 

' ' It was the feu f ollet, mon ami, Avhich led you 
astray. You cannot say you do not believe in it 
now," said Jlonique, as she glanced archly at her 
lover. 



142 Legends of Le Detroit. 

"Anything you believe in will suit me now 
and for all time," said the gallant William. 

So on the next feast day they stood before the 
altar of Ste. Anne's in Detroit, and were made one 
iorever.

THE FEAST OF ST. JEAN. 



A Iieg:end of Sandwich. 



JT WAS the eve of Pentecost wliicli fell amid 
the roses of June in 1790. 
There was a great commotion in the spacious 
kitchen of Dominique Gaudet, who lived near the 
-church on the banks of the Detroit. The hurry- 
ing to and fro of busy feet, the gleeful voices of 
merriment, mingled with the clatter of dishes, 
fragments of song and the deeper bass tones of 
the men, formed an admirable orchestra of babel 
and confusion ; for on the morrow it was Domi- 
nique who was to present the pain Mnit (blessed 
bread) and its accessory cousins (a kind of cake) 
to be distributed at high mass. Each family 
‚ñ†along la cote in turn furnished them, save at the 
Assumption (15th of August) when a portion of 



144 Legends of Le Detroit. 

tlie Huron tribe came to camp in the grove near 
the church and claimed the privilege, as they had 
donated the ground. Josephte and Lizette, the 
pani slaves, were industriously kneading the huge 
mass of dough in the wooden Kixolie (trough) whilst 
Soulange Gaudet, with her sleeves rolled up dis- 
playing the dimpled arms, and her mignonne face 
and hair all powdered with flour, was trying to 
plait the refractory dough into the semblance of 
a large wreath. This " couronne " was the orna- 
ment on the top loaf, and was always detached 
after mass and sent as a token to the person 
whose turn it would be to prepare the pain henit 
for the next feast. At a table was a gay bevy of 
girls who were cutting the cousins into palm 
shapes, and with a feather brushing the top of 
them with egg and sugar. La dame Gaudet re- 
ceived them and placed them in the big foiir 
(oven). The light from the open chimney threw 
its flickering gleams around, lighting up the Joy- 
ous faces and producing a Rembrandt effect of 
light and shade. It was a charming study for an 
artist's pencil. Soulange with two or three of her 
companions having completed their task, brushed 
the flour from their hair and dresses and strolled 
along the banks to cool their heated cheeks. The 
twilight shades were deepening and the rosy re- 
flection in the sky left its promise of a beautiful 



Legends of Le Det/roit. 145' 

morrow. They were presently joined by several 
young men who had come to help them carry the 
^ain Mnit and cousins to the church. Whilst they 
were gayly chatting Soulange, who seemed dis- 
trait and anxiously waiting for somebody, sud- 
denly called attention to an object in the water. 
They could distinguish the figure of a man who 
was apparently seated on the water. No canoe 
was visible, and yet he seemed to glide along by 
the aid of a i^addle. Whilst speculating oh the 
strange phenomenon, the increasing darkness hav- 
ing prevented close inspection, the sound of some- 
thing grating on the sand near them and a merry 
laugh, caused all to hurry down to the beach. 
They were greeted by David Fisher, who resided 
in Detroit. " Handsome David," as he was called, 
was a gay, dashing Kentuckian who had fal- 
len in love with ' ' la belle Soulange ' ' when she 
had visited her friends in Detroit. He was a 
great favorite, and spoke French like a native, and 
his easy, debonnaire manner carried captive the 
hearts of the old and young. The amazement of 
the party was intense when they found that Da- 
vid's canoe was a wheelbarrow.* He laughed at 
their perplexed looks and briefly explained that 



*Fact : A feat performed by Pierre Godfrey in fulfillment of 
a bet.

he had found no one to row him over and no boat 
to be had, so he had devised this new method ‚Äî 
a feat as difficult as Leonidas swimming the Hell- 
espont, and no less romantic. A summons from the 
house announced that all the things were in readi- 
ness to be carried to the church. As they wended 
their way, each laden with something, the gay peals 
of laughter that rang on their retreating steps told 
those who listened that David was in high humor, 
and amusing as usual with his sparkling jests and 
jeu d' esprit. In the sanctuary they arranged the 
pain lenit generally four in number and round 
in shape. The largest was placed first on a table, 
then layers of cousins and so on until the top 
loaf and its "couronne" covered the structure, 
little silk flags were stuck here and there, form- 
ing a charming and unique pyramid. 

Pentecost morning dawned bright and beautiful 
and the church was crowded. At the Credo the 
Sacristan, with his slow, measured step, approach- 
ed Soulange and presented her with a silver plate 
he held in his hand. With nervous trepidation 
she had awaited this moment, for she was the 
'‚ñ† ' queteuse ' ' of the day. She arose with a digni- 
fied composure, of which only the fleeting color, 
as it came and went in her cheek, betrayed the 
effort. She walked to the altar railing and knelt, 
then rising, presented her plate at each pew 



Legends of Le Detroit. 147 

for the collection, acknowledging the offering 
by a sweeping courtesy, whose perfection was 
attained by many an anxious hour of practice. 
The bread was blessed. The Sacristan gradually 
stripped the pyramid, cut the bread and distrib- 
uted it , to each person, who making the sign of 
the cross, ate it in silence as a symbol of the 
unity that should reign among Christians, who 
are all members of the same family. 

After mass there were hand-shakings and greet- 
ings. The scene was a most picturesque one. In 
front the broad river swept majestically ; beneath 
the cool shade of the trees were spread snowy 
white tablecloths, forming a contrast to the green 
verdure, around which were seated those habi- 
tants who lived too far to return for vespers, 
awaiting their meal. A number had gathered about 
the bedeau (Sacristan), who, arrayed in his long blue 
redingote and carrick cape edged with red, was 
crying out in a stentorian voice : ' ' Avertisement ! 
Avertisement ! " Newspapers being then un- 
known in those regions, this was the only medium 
of advertising an auction, a lost cow, or stray 
child. Soulange was joined by her lover, David, 
and they together visited the various groups 
seated on the grass, with whom they exchanged 
the compliments of the day. Several children, 
catching a glimpse of David, insisted on his 



148 Legends of Le Detroit. 

taking them to one ol the booths, which looked 
like wigwams covered with fresh branches of 
maple, and displayed a tempting array of maple 
sugar and "croquecignoles." 

That evening David and Soulange agreed they 
would be married at midsummer, for then ' ' the 
fairies would dance at the wedding ' ' David laugh- 
ingly said. Happy was Soulange these days ; her 
voice rippled with the melody of Joy which surged 
from a heart filled with love and tenderness. 

And "Merry ! merry ! merry 1" 

Rang the bells of every hour, 
And ' ' happy, happy, happy ! " 

In her valley laughed the flower. 

As the weeks passed which measured the time 
before Soulange' s wedding a shadow was creeping- 
over her horizon which would rob the smiling 
lips of laughter and smother forever her sunshine 
of happiness. Yague reports floated on the idle 
wings of rumor, of a disagreement between David 
and an oflGicer, which, though contradicted, left an 
impression of uneasiness in those who knew the 
gallant, warm-hearted, yet reckless Fisher. 

It was an open glade below Sandwich that 
the sun flooded brightly on an August morning. 
The sparkling waters were sporting with the first 
golden beams ; the branches of the trees in the 
woods skirting the field swayed lazily to the woo- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 149 

ing breeze. The flowers were still bathed in dew 
and in their moist mass were flung instruments 
of death. In the midst of an awe-stricken group 
lay a handsome, manly form, whose life was 
slowly ebbing away. The glory of the sunrise 
and the birds gushing forth their melodies, 
seemed a mockery to that sad scene, whilst an 
immortal soul was winging its flight to the un- 
known world. The surgeon who had knelt beside 
the prostrate form arose ; the pulse was stilled 
forever. 

The news of the duel and its fatal consequences 
was soon known, and the shore was lined with 
people. Soulange attracted by the crowd, came 
to inquire the cause. A hushed whispering and 
sympathetic glances greeted her, whilst a pair of 
loving hands imprisoned her and tried to lead her 
home. With a great fear over her which lent 
her strength, she wrenched herself away and flew 
to the beach. Two canoes were being slowly 
rowed up the stream towing a third, over which 
a blanket was thrown, the ends trailing mourn- 
fully in the water. The heads of the rowers were 
bowed and their attitude denoted grief and sor- 
row. The sun had veiled itself behind the clouds 
as if in pity. A solemn silence reigned, born 
only in death' s awful presence ; men uncovered 
their heads and furtively brushed away a stray 



150 Legends of Le Detroit. 

tear ; women clasped convulsively their babes to 
their breasts and murmured a prayer for that sol- 
itary figure v^hich stood on the beach. A clear 
voice pierced the ominous silence. "Bring him 
here," it said, and those who heard it would long 
remember it, for a human heart lay broken in its 
accents. Unconsciously the imperious order was 
obeyed and the canoe allowed to drift to her feet. 
Quick as lightning, deaf to the expressions of 
sympathy which burst forth from the multitude,, 
she raised the blanket and saw the dead face of 
her lover. 

Years had passed since that sad occurrence, 
when one Sunday the good priest of the Church 
of the Assumption recommended to the prayers of 
the faithful the soul of Soeur Therese of the Grey 
Order of Montreal, who had recently died after 
a life of penance and mortification. In the world 
she had been known as Soulange Gaudet.,

HAMTRAMCK'S LOVE. 



A Ziegead of Wayne's Occupation. 

QUARTER of a century 
had passed since Pontiac 
and his savage hordes bat- 
tled in vain against the 
cedar ramparts of old Fort 
Pontchartrain. The Amer- 
ican Colonies had thrown 
off the yoke of the mother country and proclaimed 
their independence. Remote from the scene of 
coniiict, the French settlement along Le Detroit 
had begun to recover from the devastations of 
their Indian neighbors. Among the habitants 
it was whispered that for the third time their flag 
was to be changed. Without asking their con- 
sent -their allegiance was to be claimed by the 




152 Legends of Le Detroit. 

"Bostonnais"* or Yankees, whose star at present 
was in the ascendant. This rumor gave rise to 
diverse sentiments. Some of the settlers felt the 
spark of liberty kindling in their breasts, and 
hailed the change as a merited overthrow of the 
haughty English, their hereditary foes. Others, 
now that the lleur de lis was withdrawn, saw their 
only safety and strength under the cross of St. 
George. The Elliots, Babys, Askins, and McKees 
were among the prominent Canadians of the latter 
class, while Robert Navarre, Jr., the Chevalier 
Chabert de la Joncaire, Louis Descomptes La- 
badie and their influential followers espoused the 
cause of the rising young republic. In 1786 Rob- 
ert Navarre, eldest son of the old sub-intendant, 
accompanied by his beautiful daughter Marianne, 
visited Philadelphia. The French colonists sought 
through him to ascertain precisely what was to be 
their status under the new government. Among 
the many illustrious men of the day to whom 
Navarre was presented was Maj. Gfen. Arthur 
St. Clair, a distinguished ofiicer of the late revo- 
lutionary war. His spirited daughter, Louisa St. 
Clair, at once became interested in Marianne Na- 
varre, the brilliant, piquante beauty of the fron-

tier. On the organization of a government for

the American possessions west of the AUeghanies) 
Gren. St. Clair was appointed Governor, and a

friend of the patriots in their struggle for inde- 
pendence. 

Louisa St. Clair, who had not forgotten the 
little Norman friend whom she had met in Phila- 
‚ñ†delphia, wrote to her as soon as she was settled at 
Marietta, challenging her to cross the intervenin g 
"Black Swamp " and visit her in her new home.

shrink from any hardships, especially where it 
promised an adventure. So, accompanied by her

relative, Antoine Gramelin, witli a band of friendly 
Indians and lier faithful pani slave, slie performed 
the perilous journey in safety. On her arrival she 
found Marietta a scene of life and excitement. The- 
newly organized First Regiment of U. S. Infantry 
was there on its way to garrison Vincennes. Its- 
corps of gay officers, among whom was Col. John 
Francis Hamtramck (then Major), made the days 
speed merrily and happily for the young maidens. 
Hamtramck had, much to the secret pleasure of the 
Grovernor, been attentive for some time to Louisa, 
yet she coyly and frequently said that her heart's" 
desire was to be the bride of some ' ' noble warrior- 
of the forest." She cultivated all the Indian sports, 
became an expert with the rifle, and one of the 
most daring and fearless horsewomen in the coun- 
try. Undaunted by the fate of Miss McRea, 
whose story every mother repeated to her child, 
she would make long excursions into the forests, 
returning with game, new specimens of flowers, 
or rare medicinal plants. Marianne was too ac- 
customed to the pastimes of a frontier life to find 
novelty in them, and was happy in perusing the 
books which her friend had brought with her 
from Philadelphia. Maj. Hamtramck was fre- 
quently by her side. She touched hidden chords 
in his heart, awaking the slumbering melodies of 
bright dreams and fanciful ideals. Louisa seemed. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 155 

strangely anxious to promote th.e friendship be- 
tween Hamtramck and Marianne, but not so the 
Grovernor, who frowned upon this new state of 
affairs. 

Marianne had been with her friend about a 
month when it was announced that the dreaded 
Chief Thayendanegea (Joseph Brandt) had camped 
in the vicinity with a band of his most noted war- 
riors. The Governor, anxious to ponciliate so pow- 
erful a foe and to secure his friendship, contem- 
plated sending an ambassador to him. The mis- 
sion was a perilous and delicate one, and required 
more than ordinary skill and diplomacy. An. 
envoy possessing these talents was not easily 
found, so the Grovernor was obliged to content 
himself by a vy^ritten missive requesting an inter- 
view. Louisa, having heard the matter discussed, 
learned who the messenger was to be. She dis- 
guised herself as an Indian girl and slung on her 
shoulder her trusty rifle. Extracting by some 
womanly art the note from the soldier, by the 
aid of her fleet horse she was soon in the presence 
of the great chieftain. Brandt was startled by 
the fair apparition, admired her daring and 
courage, and was flattered by her remembrance. 
These two had met before in Philadelphia, when 
she was at school, and he a student at col- 
lege. The young Indian had been much sought

after ; his birth, his influence with his tribe, his 
-Stately and graceful figure and rare talents, had 
made him even then a conspicuous object. It is 
not to be wondered that he became the hero of 
many a girlish heart. ' ' Noble warrior, ' ' she said, 
"I have risked my life to obtain this interview; 
you must send some one to accompany me back 
to my father." The chieftain replied, "It is 
fitting that I alone should guard so courageous a 
maiden." With a few of his braves he accompa- 
nied her home, and thus the Governor obtained the 
interview he desired. Owing to some disagree- 
ment a satisfactory treaty was not made. The 
Governor censured Louisa for what he considered 
a foolish escapade, but his anger knew no bounds 
when shortly afterwards Brandt asked him for her 
hand, which was haughtily refused. He sought 
the presence of his daughter and told her that he 
would never consent to her union with an Indian. 
He had cherished other designs, and his ardent 
wish was to see her the wife of Major Hamtramck 
whom he esteemed highly. The sharp tones of the 
angry voice penetrated to the room where Mari- 
anne sat reading, and brought to her an explana- 
tion of the Governor's peculiar manner of late 
towards her, and made her in her indignation 
question the motive of Hamtramck's devotion to 
ier. The pride of la belle France was aroused. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 157' 

She doubted the young officer's loyalty to her, and 
finding a favorable pretext, returned to Detroit 
whilst Hamtramck was away upon temporary offi- 
cial business. Shortly afterwards the embers of 
war were rekindled, and Gov. St. Clair, attacked by 
the combined savage tribes of the West, met with 
a most disastrous defeat.* He was only rescued 
from total annihilation by Hamtramck and his- 
regulars. In this battle Brandt took a prominent 
part. So anxious was he to capture St. Clair 
alive, that he gave orders to his savages to shoot 
the horse from under him, but not to kill him. 
He hoped that by sparing the General' s life, and 
making him sensible of this generosity, he could 
gain his suit and win Louisa from " Le Crapeau a 
Cheval,"-)- as he called Hamtramck, whom he sup- 
posed his rival. 

Several years had elapsed. Col. Hamtramck, 
who had so distinguished himself at the battle of 
the Maumee, where he commanded the left wing 
under Wayne, was ordered to Detroit. Here for 
the first time (1796) the Stars and Stripes were

nnfurled by Mad Anthony, and later the fort was 
named in his honor. Here Hamtramck again met 
his former sweetheart, and pleaded his cause a 
second time. He told her that he had been wound- 
ed and surprised by her sudden d^arture from 
Marietta, and had heard later of her rumored mar- 
riage to Col. Grratiot. He had endeavored to efface 
her image from his heart, had married and was 
now a widower ; hearing she was not Gratiot's 
bride he had returned to his allegiance. Marianne 
again refused him; the love which once might have 
been his had been hopelessly blighted, and her 
heart was a tomb wherein lay the ashes of buried 
hopes and bright illusions. ' ' Mademoiselle, ' ' said 
Hamtramck, ' ' since we cannot be united in life, 
in death I shall be near you. I shall give orders 
to be buiied by your side. " " Oh, that is romantic. 
Colonel, but you are a soldier and cannot say where 
your last sleep shall overtake you, ' ' she laughingly 
replied. "ISTo matter, mark me, I shall slumber 
within the shadow of your tomb." In 1803 Ham- 
tramck died, and was buried near the Navarre 
lot in the old Ste. Anne's church yard. The fol- 
lowing is the inscription on his tombstone : 

' ' Sacred to the memory of John Francis Ham- 
tramck, Colonel of the First United States Infantry, 
and Commandant of Detroit and its dependencies. 
He departed this life on the 11th day of April,

1803, aged 45 years, 7 months, 27 days. True 
patriotism and zealous attachment to national 
liberty, joined to a laudable ambition, led him 
into military service at an early age. He was a 
soldier before he was a man. He was an active 
participator in all the danger, difficulties, and 
honors of the Revolutionary War, and his heroism 
and uniforni good conduct procured him the 
attention and personal thanks of the immortal 
Washington. The United States in him have lost 
a valuable officer and good citizen, and society a 
useful and pleasant member. His friends will 
ever mourn the loss of Hamtramck." 

' ' This monument is placed over him by the offi- 
cers who had the honor to serve in his command, 
a small but grateful tribute to his worth.' ' 

Hamtramck' s remains were placed in Mount 
Elliott on the abandonment of the old Ste. Anne 
‚Ä¢cemetery. 

Fifty years later Marianne died, and her body 
has been recently removed to the (rodfroy lot, 
which is opposite the spot where Hamtramck is 
buried. His prediction has been fulfilled and he 
literally ' ' slumbers vrithin the shadow of her 
tomb." Is there a fate in this? On the lower side 
‚Ä¢of Detroit on the river bank is Fort Wayne. At 
the upper extremity of the city still stands the 
‚Ä¢old French house where Hamtramck died. The

majestic elm, like a sentinel by its side, is the 
land mark by which, passing vessels take their

name. 

Thus the two old heroes, even in death, hold 
their favorite respective positions, guarding the 
left and right flank,* whilst the name of Ham- 
tramck' s rival is still perpetuated in one of our 
most prominent business avenues (G-ratiot). 

*At the battle of Maumee, August, 1794, Wayne commanded 
the right wing and Hamtramck the left wing. This great victory 
over the Indians gave the Americans their first actual control of 
Detroit and the surrounding country.

French, habitants* and the new comers. In the 
families of these descendants are stUl preserved 
the quaint traditions of the French, also some of 
the physical traits, particularly the shapely foot 
and hand, and to-day the sale of shoes from the 
so-called Creole last, follows the line of French 
posts from Detroit, Monroe, Fort Wayne, Vin- 
cennes, and St. Louis down to New Orleans. It 
is from one of these old families that the incidents 
‚Ä¢embodied in the following story are gathered. 

In 1795 Didier Duch^ne lived with his wife and 
little daughter Fanchette on the banks of the 
Rouge. His aged mother resided with him, a 
venerable dame who lingered seemingly forgot- 
ten, beyond her time. Bat not so, thought 
Fanchette, who would steal from her play to 
sit beside grandmdre, nestle her curly head 
against her knee, and listen with flushed cheeks 
and eyes glowing with wonderment to the 
marvelous tales she told. There is something 
beautiful in the witchery which a pious, serene 
old age exercises over impressionable childhood. 
There seems to be a perfect union between them, 

*Habitants. A word whose meaning has been singularly per- 
verted. It meant formerly the permanent settlers who came to 
" habiter le pays " (inhabit the country), in contradistinction to the 
military and civil functionaries who were transient. The richest 
merchant might be an habitant, that is, a permanent settler. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 163 

a mystic tie wMcti as we advance in youth and 
towards middle age appears gradually to weaken. 
Perhaps the spontaneous reverence which lisping 
childhood pays to the aged, arises from the shadow 
of the mystery of its own existence which still 
envelops it, and the subtle instincts of compan- 
ionship which nature instills in those standing 
on the confines of unknown worlds. It is the un- 
conscious tribute of the mystery of the cradle to 
that of the grave. Childhood and old age have 
no present ; one lives in the past, the other in the 
future. 

One day grandmere died, and Panchette felt 
that the sunshine had all crept out of her heart 
and left a great void. It was Fanchette's first 
contact with death and she felt its awe-striking 
influence, and wandered about listlessly ques- 
tioniag everything why all was so changed % She 
would sob herself to sleep, and in dreamland 
would hear again the sweet, faltering accents of 
grandmere. One evening she awoke her parents 
by a ringing shriek ; they hastened to her, and 
found her excitedly exclaiming: "Grandmere, 
grandmere ; don't you hear her ? " To soothe her 
they remained quiet a moment and distinctly 
heard the hum of the old dame' s spinning wheel 
in the adjoining room. Terror seized them, and 
it was only at the earnest pleading of' the child 



164: Legends of Le Detroit. 

"to see grandmere" that they regained sufficient 
courage to open the door. But instantly the noise 
ceased ; the room was quiet and nothing disturbed- 
Night after night the same occurrence took 
place. To Fanchette the phantom hum of the 
spinning wheel was a sweet lullaby, and an as- 
surance that the dear grandmdre was near. But 
the parents who had always laughed at the old 
lady' s superstitions, felt it a warning for their in- 
credulity. The ' ' Bon Pere ' ' was consulted, and 
after hearing the story, asked if they had left 
any promise ‚ñ† unfulfilled to the dead. "Ah! Mon 
Dieii," cried Didier, conscience-striken, "I prom- 
ised fifty masses for the repose of her soul and to* 
distribute some things among the poor." The 
promise was soon after fulfilled, and the spinning- 
wheel no longer sent forth its weird music on the 
midnight air. 

Years rolled on until Fanchette counted 16, the 
marriageable age among the maidens of that day. 
Her mother favored the suit of a little Canadian, 
but the girl' s heart inclined toward a brave Ken- 
tuckian. It was a severe struggle for that docile 
girl, between her obedience to her mother and her 
affection for her lover. The great Canadian festi- 
val of St. Jean Baptiste, or Midsummer Day, as- 
the English called it, was nigh. 
To ward's nightfall the great bonfire {fen dejoie), 



Legends of Le Detroit. 166 

was kindled. It was an octagonal pyramid about 
eight or ten feet high, erected opposite the chnrch 
on the beach, and was covered with branches of 
fir stuck in the interstices of the logs of cedar of 
which it was built. The lighted taper was applied 
to each little heap of straw placed at each of the 
eight corners of the verdant cone. The flames 
arose sparkling and scintillating amidst hurrahs, 
cheers and deafening volleys of guns. The cus- 
tom was of Norman origin, and commemorated 
the time when the bonfire was the only medium of 
‚ñ†communication for those living on opposite shores, 
and especially in winter, when they were shiit off 
from each other. Thus fire became a language 
and they who knew its alphabet could read in the 
swaying flames the message of death, sickness or 
joyful tidings. On the eve of the festival great 
bonfires were built along the beach of the Detroit 
and all kept the vigil, as it was thought if any one 
slept his soul would leave the body and wander 
to find the place where death was to overtake 
him. At sunrise if close watch was kept one 
might see the sun dance three times. 

Fanchette had come to the fort to visit friends 
but her principal interest in the day was centered 
on a trial which she had decided to make as to 
whom she should choose for a husband. At the 
hour of twelve, everything was quiet in the house. 



166 Legends of Le Detroit. 

She cautiously made her way to the garden sur- 
rounded by its high cedar pickets, and taking a 
handful of wild hemp seed, she scattered it on 
the ground saying, 

"Hemp I sow, hemp I hoe, 
Who is my love come after me now." 

To her intense joy, a vague resemblance of the 
Kentuckian arose and stalked across the garden. 

Then hastily plucking a few sprigs of vervain,, 
a plant so useful in warding off goblins and pos- 
sessing wonderful powers, she carefully picked a 
rose de France, which she felt would keep fresh 
until marriage time at Christmas, and returned to 
her room to watch with the others, and muse on 
her happiness in store. 

The same belief and traditions repeat them- 
selves in other lands as is seen in the oft quoted 

POEM OF ST. JOHN'S WORT. 

The young maid stole through the cottage door. 
And blushed as she saw the plant of power ; 
"Thou silver moon glow, oh lend me thy light, 
I must gather the mystic St. John's wort to-night, 
The wonderful herb whose leaf will decide 
If the coming year will make me a bride!" 

And the glow-worm came 

With its silvery flame, 

And sparkled and shone 

Through the night of St. John, 
And soon has the maid her love-knot tied. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 167 

With noiseless tread 

To her chamber she sped, 
Where the spectral moon her white beams shed; 
Bloom here, bloom there, thou plant of power, 
To deck the young bride in her bridal hour; 
But it drooped Its head, that plant of power. 
And died the mute death of the voiceless flower. 

And a withered wreath on the ground it lay. 
More meet for a burial than a bridal day; 
And when a year was passed away 
All pale on her bier the young maid lay. 

And the glow-worm came 

With its silvery flame, 

And sparkled and shone 

Through the night of St. John, 
As they" closed the cold grave on the maid's~cold claj'. 

When Christmas came little Fanchette decked 
as a bride stood by the side of her gallant Ken- 
tuckian, and said the words which made her his 
"for weal or for woe." She told him afterwards 
the story of St. Jean's eve, and transformed him 
into a fervent believer in grandmdre' s supersti- 
tions. A few years later a group of merry chil- 
dren might have been seen in theDuchene orchard 
burning bundles of straw under the trees, whilst 
they chanted : 

Taupes, chenilles, et mulcts 

Sortez sortez de vos clos 
Ou, je vous brule la barbe et les os 

Arbres, arbrisseaux 
Donnez moi des pommes a minot.

THE CTJRSED VILLAGE. 



A Legend of Ij'Anse Creuse. 

IT WAS on a glorious September morning that 
our carriage rolled along the picturesque shore 
of Grosse Pointe. The soft, misty waves of fog 
which trailed over the smooth cut lawn and over 
the broad lake were gradually curling themselves 
into graceful, spiral wreaths, to dissolve in the 
sunlight. If there is a touch of sadness in Au- 
tumn, an indescribable yearning after something 
indefinable, there is a strength to resist the de- 
pression in the fresh, bracing atmosphere which 
lends roses to the cheek and buoyancy to the step. 
Nature, as if conscious of this tinge of melancholy, 
‚ñ†dons her brightest colors, throws around her that 
mystic, mellow light which rounds the sharpest

outlines and softens the roughest landscapes, andl 
whilst we are enchanted by her gorgeous devices- 
we forget the sad reflections of this season of 
decay. 

We passed the fashionable drive, bordered by 
its handsome villas with their evidences of culture 
and refinement, crossed the tottering bridge over- 
Milk River, into a strange country and a past 
age. Occasionally signs of a well-to-do farmer- 
greeted us, but these were rare. Silence, monot- 
ony and dilapidation were written everywhere. 
The lake here swept majestically into the shore 
forming a graceful curve. This was the Bay of 
L'Anse Creuse from which the village on its 
banks derived its name, we were told. Dim, 
shadowy memories of a legend connected with 
this place drifted confusedly through my brain, 
and asking the driver about it, he told us that 
there lived not far an old habitant who was well 
vei'sed in all such lore, and who would be but too- 
happy to have a listener. Ten minutes later we 
entered a humble cottage, stated our errand, and 
were received -with that genuine courtesy, the pe- 
culiar heritage of the French, which caused Syd- 
ney Smith to envy the manners of his cobbler in 
Paris. The old raconteur introduced us to his 
children and grandchildren, who eyed us politely,, 
but with curious, speculative eyes, unused to a.

sudden inroad of strangers. The habitant evi- 
dently relished telling a story, and smacking his 
lips after the manner of an epicure, told us the 
legend of L'Anse Creuse. 

It was the fea;St of Corpus Christi in June, and 
the whole neighborhood of L' Anse Creuse was in 
a whirl of excitement. For to-day the Bishop 
was coming from the fort (Detroit) accompanied 
by the new pastor, to consecrate the little chapel. 
The young men on horseback with their guns to 
fire a salute, had gone to meet them, whilst the 
children, dressed in white, bearing flowers and 
looking like so many butterflies, were flitting to 
and fro, and the habitants in their Sunday attire 
were gaily chatting. All of a sudden a discharge 
of guns announced the near approach of the cleri- 
cal party, and in a few moments all were formed 
in a procession. Banners were unfurled, voices 
were raised chanting the Te Deum, clouds of in- 
cense rose to perfume the air and the pathway 
' was strewn with flowers. 

Thus were they escorted to the church, and 
amidst that grand silence so appealing in its so- 
lemnity, the imposing ceremonies took place. 
They were followed by a short but eloquent ad- 
dress from their new pastor. Father Gabriel. He 
thanked them for their welcome and hoped that 
God would bless his efforts ; he would endeavor 



172 Legends of Le Detroit. 

to prove a true shepherd, but his flock must aid 
him to keep in the narrow path. He alhided 
lightly to that greatest of all temptations, exces- 
sive drinking, which brought so many evils in 
its train, and which was so difficult to overcome. 

Perhaps the eagle eye of the priest had noted 
the recess on the banks, where old Francois Fon- 
tenoy, the celebrated Indian trader (who had 
buried a brass kettle of gold at Presque Isle, and 
"which has caused as many explanations and con- 
jectures as Kidd' s treasure), had tapped a barrel 
‚ñ†of genuine eau de vie to appease the thirsty. 

After the blessing, all dispersed to give them- 
selves up to the enjoyment of the day. The 
young men amused themselves by shooting in the 
air, which caused a stranger, who seemed by his 
manner and dress to take no part in the day' s re- 
joicing, to say, -'They are shooting the devil out 
‚ñ†of the neighborhood." One near him jestingly 
replied, "Perhaps he was never here until you 
‚ñ†came ; you must have brought him." An angry ' 
flush crept over the swarthy face of the stranger, 
who with a muttered something, turned on his 
heels and Joined old Fontenoy and his flowing 
glass. 

This man, Lizon by name, had recently settled 
at L' Anse Creuse. Being reserved in his manner, 
he merely stated that he came from Montreal. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 173- 

He formed a contrast to the light-hearted villag- 
ers, who lived as one family, shared each others 
joys and sorrows, and who were closely bound by 
the ties of early association and relationship. 
Lizon rejected in a morose manner their friendly 
overtures, and was soon left to the solitude he 
seemed to covet. He possessed means, for he had 
purchased land, and built an auberge where liquor- 
was the chief inducement. 

One day it was announced that Lizon had asked 
Julienne, the daughter of a respected habitant, to- 
marry him. The amazement of the good people 
was intense, as Julienne was a sweet, pious girl, 
and had rejected half of the youths of L'Anse 
Creuse, whilst this Lizon was ugly, cross-eyed 
and had a halt in his walk, besides had never- 
been known to enter the church. 

How he won the damsel was a sort of mystery 
to all, a constant theme of conjecture. Some- 
boldly said it was sorcery. -The parents of the 
girl were opposed to the marriage, but seeing how 
headstrong she was, left her to her own devices. 

Lizon refused to be married in church, as he 
would then be obliged to attend to his religious 
duties. Julienne besought him, but to no avail. 
What argument he used, what witchcraft he em- 
ployed, is not known, but Julienne deserted her 
home and came to live with Lizon. Father Gabriel

who had been absent, returned a few days after 
^nd found his community excited over the scandal. 
He immediately sent for both culprits. Neither 
obeyed his command. The following Sunday 
he hurled against them the fearful ban of excom- 
munication, and stated that Lizon had a wife and 
children whom he had deserted, living in Montreal. 
From that day no one crossed the threshold of 
Xiizon's door, ‚Äî the grass grew rank, and seldom was 
Julienne seen. Lizon' s rage knew no bounds; he 
repaired a dilapidated barn and there kept liquor 
for all who desired to procure it. Those who had 
feared to go to the auberge flocked to this new 
place and soon the evil influence of this drinking 
was felt. The peace which reigned in this Arca- 
dia of Lake Ste. Claire was broken ; dissensions, 
quarrels and scandals arose. The voice of the 
priest seemed powerless and his eiiorts paralyzed 
by the demon of liquor. 

Julienne, who was seldom seen, startled the 
congregation one Sunday morning by standing in 
front of the altar and asking public pardon, 
through the priest, for the great scandal she had 
caused. All in the church were melted into tears, ‚Ä¢ 
and the voice of the pastor was tremulous with 
emotion as he welcomed back the erring sheep 
into the fold. 

When Lizon discovered the flight of Julienne, 



Legends of Le Detroit. 175 

that she had returned to her God and to her par- 
-ents, his anger was fearful. He swore that he 
would have her back, that he would spurn any- 
thing that stood in his way. The bay would 
rsooner break its bonds than he forego his design.

The d'Ignolee knocked for admittance at the 
door of Julienne' s father ; they were welcomed and 
received their offerings. Whilst the party was 
singing a sudden cry of distress caused all to rush 
to the door. Kothing was seen and the d' Ignolee 
immediately departed. The father called Juli- 
enne for the evening rosary and receiving nO' 
answer, went to her room ; she was not there. 
Immediately they suspected that Lizon was among 
the d' Ignolee. The cry they had heard was hers 
and a warning to the rest of the d'Ignolee to leave. 
Messengers liew to stop the d' Ignolee and others 
ran to Lizon' s, but they did not find Julienne. 
Father Gabriel was sent for and he went to de- 
mand Julienne of Lizon who laughed at him, say- 
ing he did not recognize his authority and did not 
understand why he, Father G-abriel, should inter- 
fere with what did not concern him. The priest 
answered that Julienne was one of his flock, she 



Legends of Le Detroit. 17 1 

had willingly left Lizon and lie had stolen her. A 
scream for help from the house was heard and 
Julienne's father and others rushing in, found 
her and brought her back. The night of horrors 
was too much for her; she became a maniac. 
Lizon, maddened by liquor and at the defeat of 
his plans, in his rage struck the priest in the face 
and blasphemed everything sacred. A few sprang 
forward to seize Lizoii, but the majority looked on. 

Father Gabriel raised his hands and said that 
Lizon has brought a curse on the place, and caused 
others, by his bad example, to follow in his foot- 
steps ; and he again pronounced the awful edict 
of excommunication against him. That unless he 
repented, even in the grave he should have no rest ; 
and all who aided or abetted him in his evil deeds 
would suffer. Their church would be swept away h/ 
the rising waters. 

Father Gabriel left for Fort Pontchartrain, and 
Lizon took every occasion to distribute his vile 
liquor and to malign the good character of the 
priest. But somehow nothing seemed to prosper. 
The season set in wet and stormy, the fruit failed 
to ripen and was blasted on the trees. The crops 
were all destroyed and clouds of locusts devoured 
the young grass. The people murmured among 
themselves and looked for the return of the good 
priest, whose interest in their behalf they had re- 

18 



178 Legends of Le Detroit. 

warded with ingratitude, and on whose departure 
disaster had come. One day the old auberge was 
closed, and it was said that Lizon had died unex- 
pectedly. He was hurriedly placed in a coffin and 
a grave dug in unconsecrated ground. As the 
bearers were about to place the coffin in its final 
resting place, they suddenly felt it grow lighter, 
whilst out of the grave issued loathsome serpents 
without number. For many days these occur- 
rences were common gossip. Phantasmagorial 
forms in white could be seen moving about, and 
those who looked towards Lizon' s grave saw it 
roll and heave, whilst the feu f ollet skipped about 
in all directions. 

A fearful storm set in, lashing the waves into 
foamy billows mountain high and dashing them 
against the shore with such force as to sweep over 
the road. Higher and higher the waters crept, 
climbing up towards the orchards of fine Colville 
apples and the stately pears, survivors of the days 
of "le grand monarch." Closer and closer the 
angry surf came to the little church; the water 
had undermined the quicksand beneath it, and 
with a groan and deafening crash it sank into the 
mighty element. The people frightened by the 
fearful disaster fled in terror to the woods, where 
they remained through the night. Day dawned 
peaceably; the habitants returned to their deserted

homes, rebuilt their clmrcli, and by their prayers 
and the faithful observance of their duties, re- 
moved the curse which rested on L' Anse Creuse.

SANS SOUCI AND OKEMOS. 



The Xiegrend of a Centenarian. 

ONE of the best known houses in Detroit dur- 
ing the early part of this century stood on 
the north-east corner of the present Wood- 
ward avenue and "Woodbridge street, fronting on 
the latter, then "par excellence" the fashion- 
able street. A hospitable old French domicile 
was this, with its big fire place occupying nearly 
the entire side of a room in the centre of which 
was a stout oaken table with carved legs and 
rush-bottomed chairs around it. About the floor 
were deer and buflEalo skins on which unexpected 
guests (frequently chiefs of the neighboring Indian 
tribes) might stretch their weary limbs and with 
their feet on the hearth beguile the night away. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 181 

This was the home of Gabriel Grodefroy, agent 
of the Pottawatomies and Chippewas. Style 
then was not a ruling element as at the present 
time. General Cass relates that when he ar- 
rived he found benches instead of chairs in ordi- 
nary use, and that an old bottle was frequently 
the nearest approach to a candlestick ; and ser- 
vants being scarce he who served himself was 
best served. So his friends often saw him re- 
turning from market with a great yellow pump- 
kin under his arm, and on occasions of necessity 
he did not disdain to place across his broad 
shoulders the neck-yoke, a certain machine with 
two buckets pendent from its extremities, which 
constituted the primitive water works, the river 
then as now furnishing a never-failing supply of 
the beverage. , Long intercourse with the Indian 
tribes had simplified the tastes of the habitants 
and brought with it freedom from care and the 
calls of the tax-collector. 

The proprietor of this house previously men- 
tioned, was one of the few born within the walls 
of old Fort Pontchartrain under French rule, 
who survived all the eventful changes and who 
lived to serve the American government forty 
years. His boon companions were Chabert de 
Joncaire, Desconiptes Labadie, Francois de 
Laselle, Jacques Campeau, Antoine Beaubien, 



182 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Pierre Navarre, Antoine De Quindre, Jacques 
Duperon Baby, Whittmore Knaggs and other 
hardy pioneers of this outpost of civilization. 
Some of them were sure to happen in at Gode- 
froy's during the long winter evenings and would 
meet there such chiefs as Tecumseh, Black Hoof, 
Walk in the Water, Okemos (a nephew of Pon- 
tiac) and others whose names are familiar. The 
law required an Indian agent to keep open house 
for all representative savages who chanced to 
visit the post. How often have I sat by the 
crackling fire of blazing logs, listening to the 
wild tales of Indian fights, wonderful hunts, hair- 
breadth escapes, etc. , etc. ! How they laughed as 
they told the story of old Sans Souci, a super- 
annuated mare the date of whose birth was 
beyond the ken of the oldest habitant ! This 
remarkable animal was the property of Gode- 
froy's clerk, Jean Beaugrand, a mysterious old 
bachelor who was himself looked askance at by 
all the children of the fort on account of a 
strange habit he had of mumbling to himself. 
How old Sans Souci survived for so many 
years was inexplicable, for she was sure to visit 
each neighbor's cornfield or watermelon patch 
once a week, and before escaping therefrom had 
to run a wild gauntlet of stones and sticks. The 
more stolen provender she disposed of the leaner 



Legends of Le Detroit. 183 

she grew, until at last she became a veritable 
scarecrow. No fence was bigli enough, to keep 
her out, and there was a tradition that she had once 
jumped the pickets of the fort, twelve feet in 
height. In case some over-exasperated habitant 
shot at her she would merely kick up her heels 
and switch her tail by way of return salute. A 
whip or club had no effect on her except to cause 
a sort of scowl and a malicious laying back of 
the ears. On bright, sunny days she would saun- 
ter forth on the narrow streets or stand with 
downcast head on the corner for hours, evidently 
communing with herself on by-gone scenes, only 
aroused by a dog fight or a knot of idlers dis- 
cussing politics in which she seemed to take a 
lively interest. Occasionally she would open 
wide her mouth in apparent laughter at the rec- 
ollection of some old joke. At other times she 
would shake her head wisely and blink with 
the dignity of a sage judge delivering a pro- 
found opinion. What Sans Souci was thinking 
about no one could teU ; that was the mystery. 
She would only brighten up when her master, 
Beaugrand, who seemed to have some private 
understanding with her, appeared around the 
corner and beckoned her to the barn just behind 
the house. For an instant a reminiscence of 
departed youth would animate her, causing her 



184 Legends of Le Detroit. 

to prick up her ears and forget her usual snail- 
like pace, in expectation of fodder to come. Jean 
used to avow that years before his old mare had 
broken a leg in a race on the ice but that she 
kept right on and won the race in spite of it. 
Tradition has it that a line of steeds which 
sprang from this same mare have a peculiar habit 
of cutting up the same capers, even to this day. 
It was in 1805, the year of the famous fire, that 
a number of French and Indians were seated 
around Godef roy' s festal board. ISTtimerous pota- 
tions had exhausted the jug of cider, and Oke- 
mos, who was present, became clamorous for 
something stronger. "You will have to find 
Jean, then," said Godef roy, "he has the key to 
the cellar. ' ' The Indian immediately disappeared 
but soon after returned in evident terror. He 
announced that seeing a light in Beaugrand's 
window over the barn, he had looked through 
the chinks and saw Jean seated with the old 
mare. Sans Souci, before a table and that both 
were laughing and chatting together. It was 
not strange that an Indian should believe this, 
for they aU looked on bears, wolves and beavers 
as reasoning beings, and only prevented from 
speaking by an evil spirit. Godefroy, to the 
great horror of Okemos, exclaimed, ' ' We wUl 
see about this," and followed by several of his 



Legends of Le Detroit. 185 

French guests ascended the ladder leading to 
Jean's room, determined to put an end to this 
spiritual seance. A Frenchman who cautiously 
peeked through a crack avowed that he could 
see Jean playing " seven-up " with the old mare, 
and that they were pouring into a pewter cup 
and drinking what looked by lamplight like 
melted brass. Godefroy, indignant at such non- 
sense, dashed his foot against the door which 
yielded. Both the Frenchmen with him declared 
they saw the old mare leap out of the window 
when the door flew open, but Jean on being ac- 
^cused of diabolical work insisted that he was 
‚ñ†only concocting a little "cidre an charbon" by 
the light of his lantern, and that the mare would 
be found in the stable below. Okemos, however, 
who had followed, would not believe this story 
but considered Godefroy a "big medicine" to 
‚ñ†dare to disturb the evil spirit at his meals. Ever 
after this Godefroy' s influence with the Indians 
was aU-powerful. As to the old mare, her days 
vpere numbered. A few weeks later the cry of 
:fire resounded though the post, and in a few 
Tiours not a single habitation was left to indicate 
where old Detroit had stood. The old barn, of 
course, was burned, and the superstitious ones 
who thought that Sans Souci was carried off 
t&gt;y the devil in a cloud of smoke, were shown' her 



186 Legends of Le Detroit. 

charred remains the next day. There were many, 
however, who asserted that they saw the dreaded 
Nain Rouge (or little red man), the traditional 
fiend of the fort, on the roof of the barn just 
before it fell in, and that he grinned and chuckled 
as he did on the day the old French flag was 
hauled down. When war broke out with Eng- 
land, the United States Government by a mistaken 
policy at first allowed the British to secure con- 
trol of the Indian tribes. But after Winches- 
ters defeat and the cold-blooded massacre of 
Kentucky troops, Okemos and his Chippewas 
with many others, were secured to the American 
cause by Godefroy's influence.* It was one of his 

*Narrative of Elizabeth Ann Godefroy, daughter of Judge 
James May: "About two weeks after the battle of the Kiver 
Kaisin, during the absence of my husband from home, I pur- 
chased a prisoner from a Pottawatomie Indian named Ta-tas- 
sa. This was in the month of February, 1813. The Indians- 
were about to burn him at the stake in the yard before our house. 
I called on my husband's clerk and interpreter, Raumaine La 
Chambre, and said to him that he must devise some way to save 
the American. Being ill and near the period of confinement, the 
interpreter said that if I were to ask of the Indians, the prisoner 
as an adopted son they might give him up. So I followed his. 
advice, and on hearing the request they shrugged their shoulders, 
saying, ' Oh ! oh ! it is bad medicine to refuse a woman in your 
condition anything, but this is a Yankee dog and we must burn 
him.' I then asked them what they would take for his ransom. 
They replied, one hundred dollars. Having but ten dollars at. 
hand I offered them a fine black horse well saddled and bridled,. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 18T 

friendly Indians that brought Grodefroy the first 
news of Perry's victory, and the enthusiastic 
Frenchman hastened to promulgate it from house 
to house, lightening the hearts of a people almost 

belonging to my husband, with two bundles of dry goods and a 
lot of silver work (for Indian use) together with the ten dollars in 
money, in all worth some two hundred dollars. But the Indians 
replied, ' This is not money to us and we will not sell him. ' I 
then told them through the interpreter that we had in the cellar 
a five-gallon keg of whiskey. At this they held a council among 
themselves, and finallj^ sold me the prisoner and went their way. 
His name was John Henry, from Louisville, Kentucky. He said 
his wife's name was Nancy Burnet, and that he had a child six 
months old named Valentine. Immediately after the purchase I 
gave him something to eat, and had the interpreter shave off his 
beard and dress him in the garb of an old French voyageur, so as 
to disguise him as much as possible, fearing that when the whis- 
key was all gone the Indians would return and demand the pris- 
oner, or more whiskey, which was not to be had at any price. 
After a short rest I sent the prisoner under charge of a French- 
man to my father, Judge May, of Detroit, whom I desired to at- 
tend to his exchange, which he did by sending my brother, James 
May, Jr., with him to Major Muir, British Commandant. As I 
had anticipated the Indians returned by daylight and brought 
back all that I had given them except the whiskey and demanded 
the prisoner, or more whiskey. I told them through the inter- 
preter I had given them all I had and they then began a search 
about the house for the prisoner. La Chambre said to them : 
'Now you see the poor woman after paying you well for the pris- 
oner has lost all she gave and her adopted son also, for your Brit- 
ish father sent his soldiers here last night and took him away from 
her.' So half believing the story they left for the border of the 
woods thinking he might possibly be concealed there. The pris- 
oner on leaving promised to write to me but if he did, his letters 
never reached us."

‚ñ†driven to despair by Proctor's tyrannies and the 
insatiable exactions of his savage allies. 

While the site of the old house is stUl in pos- 
session of Godefroy's descendants, the ground on 
which the old barn stood is occupied by a police 
‚ñ†station, and_. from the shrieks and groans that 
‚ñ†often emanate from some of its frenzied occupants 
while under the influence of potations of strych- 
nine (modern whiskey), we may well infer that 
the ghosts of both Sans Souci and the Nain 
Rouge still haunt the spot.

THE SIBYL'S PROPHECY. 



A Leg'end of the Huron .Villag'e. 

T WAS in August, 1806. 
^ e The Hurons, following- 
their usual yearly custom 
had come to camp near the 
church in Sandwich, ta 
celebrate what was then 
called "Le Festin des 
Sauvages," (The Indian 
Feast). After assisting devoutly at mass, they 
filed out one by one according to grade, for these 
monarchs of the forest were as tenacious of their 
rank as the Ancienne Noblesse of France, whO' 
even respected the rights of precedence in mount- 
ing the steps of the guillotine. 




190 Legends of Le Detroit. 

A grand feast was prepared in the grove to 
which were invited the clergy and those of the 
habitants whom the Hurons knew well and desired 
to honor. The menu was not in strict conformity 
to the rules of the superb epicure, Brillat Sava- 
rin. But those who partook of the repast were 
reared in that healthy atmosphere which demands 
no sauce piqiiante to suggest appetite to blase 
palates. It consisted of a soup made of game to 
which were added corn and summer squash ; fresh 
fish from the clear waters ; abundance of game, 
well dressed; praline made of parched corn pound- 
ed between two stones and mixed with maple 
sugar (supplying the place of the modern baker's 
loaf to the wayfarers of early times) ; sagamite, a 
porridge made of corn, and fruit completed the 
bill of fare. 

Among those present was Angelique Couture 
who had been the " queteuse " for the collection 
in the church that day, a task she performed in 
that easy, graceful manner peculiar to the French 
girl. Another guest was Francois Navarre, whose 
father was prominently connected with the Indian 
trafiic, and whose fluent tongue had won for him 
the sobriquet of Robiche (the speaker). Francois 
inherited his sire' s facile and happy speech which, 
added to charming and persuasive manners, gained 
him many strong allies among the fair sex both 



Legends of Le Detroit. 191 

of Sandwich, and Detroit. He was distantly re- 
lated to Angelique and made that slender tie a 
favorable pretext to seek frequently the society of 
the bright-eyed coquette who even carried the 
witchery of her charms so far as to captivate the 
hearts of the savage braves. 

As soon as the meal was over the young men 
gave themselves up to their favorite game of ball, 
the chiefs smoked in dignified repose their be- 
loved calumet. The children clustered around 
' ' le bon pere ' ' to hear some holy legend, whilst 
others more volatile pursued the many hued 
butterflies. The young squaws swept away the 
debris of the feast, pausing now and then to 
caress the little dusky papoose who, suspended 
in the birchen cradle on the bough of a tree, was 
swayed lazily by the breeze. 

Angelique finding no amusement to divert her, 
proposed to two of her companions that they 
should seek the prophetess of the tribe, of whom 
they had heard most marvelous tales. The 
proposition rather frightened the timid girls, 
but Angelique excited their curiosity to such a 
degree that they eagerly followed her, and as they 
leisurely strolled along she kept up their courage 
by her inimitable mimicry until'the forest rang 
with their joyous laughter. 

Suddenly a turn in their path brought them 



192 Legends of Le Detroit. 

face to face with the object of their search. Lean- 
ing over and stirring a kettle on the smouldering 
fire, was the figure of a woman who was chanting- 
in a low monotone a song of incantation to which 
she kept time by the swaying motion of her body. 
This was the dreaded Sibyl whose solitary hab- 
its, strange wanderings and wonderful gift of 
prophecy had thrown a veil of mystery over her. 
which few had ever attempted to raise. No one 
knew her history save that she had been made 
a captive years before. She always followed 
the tribe to its various encampments, yet lived 
apart, never crossing a threshold save in cases of 
severe sickness. Her knowledge of the different 
healing herbs was considered equal to, if not 
greater than that of the renowned medicine men. 
The old habitants involuntarily crossed themselves 
when the strange, stern woman passed them. 

The girls on the impulse of the moment thought 
of flight, but were arrested by an unaccountable 
fascination. The woman evidently had heard 
their approach, for she turned slowly and raising 
herself up to her full height displayed a taU, com- 
manding figure, a face bronzed by exposure, and 
eyes accustomed to lonely vigils. She asked in a 
deep, sonorous voice, "What do you seek ? " Sum- 
moning up courage Angelique tremblingly replied, 
"Knowledge of the future." "Heedless ones " 



Legends of Le Detroit. 193 

she replied,. " read it for yourselves ; it is written 
everywhere, on the broad face of the sky, on the 
leaves of the trees. Ere many moons this very 
soil will become the scene of carnage; the air will 
be filled with lamentations. These woods which 
have re-echoed to your careless merriment will re- 
sound to the savage warwhoop and the tomahawk 
wiU gleam in the upraised hands. Lovers will be 
separated, wives will be made widows and chil- 
dren orphans. Go, you have heard enough." 

Passively obeying her imperious gesture the 
girls silently retraced their steps, with the gay 
smiles frozen on their lips and the sunlight faded 
from their eyes. But their other companions 
joining them, enticed them into the mysteries of 
the moccasin game, and with the careless insou- 
ciance of youth they forgot for the moment the 
Sibyl and her gloomy predictions. 

The great comet of 1812 shortly afterwards ap- 
peared as a premonition of war, and to the super- 
stitious there were other signs of ill omen and dis- 
aster. War was soon declared and spread its devast- 
ing influence over the land, converting this fair 
region into a scene of bloodshed and rendering its 
peaceful homes desolate. Angelique's brothers 
fought under the banner of St. George, her lover, 
Francois, under the Stars and Stripes. These 
were days of anguish and suspense to the sad 

13 



194 Legends of Le Detroit. 

watchers at home, and Angelique's heart was 
divided in its allegiance. She heard of the battles, 
of the terrible massacres, of the sad fate of the 
prisoners, but received no tidings of her lover. 

One day Proctor passed through Sandwich on 
his way to his encampment near the church, and 
elated by his recent success at the battle of the 
river Raisin, was displaying in proud triumph 
his captives, whose dejected mien, travel- worn and 
weary forms covered with dust, appealed to the 
tender sympathies of the spectators. 

Among them Angelique recognized the stately 
iigure of her lover. Stunned by the blow she did 
not realize its full meaning, untU the sorrowful 
procession had passed. Shortly afterwards to her 
^reat surprise, Francois knocked for admission; 
being so well known he had been paroled until 
sunset, and one hour he had to spend with his be- 
loved. Sad was the interview, bitter the parting; 
ior them there was no morrow. The weU-known 
character of Proctor whose cruelty equalled that of 
his savage allies, left no hope for intercession. The 
girl clung to her lover and frantically besought him 
to fly, to avail himself of his liberty, to escape 
the frightful death at the stake which awaited 
him on the morrow. Her tender pleadings might 
well unnerve a strong man, but honor triumphed 
and pointing mutely to the setting sun, Fran- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 195 

cois wrenched himself from her detaining arms 
and with her despairing cries ringing in his 
ears, reached the camp as the sun was sinking be- 
low the horizon. 

This act of extreme honor commanded even 
Indian appreciation, and they left him unbound. 
Sad and melancholy were his thoughts. How much 
that parting with Angelique cost him, and his 
struggle with love and honor his altered face be- 
trayed. Memories of the past greeted him every- 
where, with no ray of hope to gild the gloom of 
sorrow. 

Savage cries of exultation awoke the doomed 
man from his meditations. He saw the Indians had 
all rushed to the beach to welcome new prisoners 
who were landing, and in the hurry of the moment 
had left him ungaurded. His practiced eye took in 
the situation and commending his soul to his 
Maker, he had vanished into the forest before the 
barbarous warwhoojjs told him that his depart- 
ure had been discovered, and that the red fiends 
were in pursuit. 

A squad of Dickson's noted savages hideous 
in war paint and feathers, surrounded Ange- 
Hque's home. The interpreter explained that 
Francois Navarre had reported himself as prom- 
ised, but taking advantage of an unguarded mo- 
ment had escaped. The Indians were impatient to 



196 Legends of Le Detroit. 

enter, and the interpreter no longer able to restrain 
them, said that the house must be searched. Ange- 
lique thanked God that her lover had escaped 
but trembled at the idea of his capture, for it 
seemed impossible for him to elude his pursuers. 
The house swarmed with the savages who left no 
spot unvisited. Even the chimneys were exam- 
ined and the beds pierced by bayonets^ until satis- 
fied that the fugitive was not there, the Indians 
leaving a guard in case he should seek refuge 
there, withdrew. 

An Indian chief came to iC^ngflique a few days 
later and triumphantly pointed to a fresh scalp 
which hung at his belt, which the vraetched girl 
thought her lover's. The suspense, followed by 
what she imagined was his tragic fate, was too 
much for her to bear, and she gradually began to 
fade. Soon afterwards a well-known token from 
her lover found its way to her which brought life to 
her heart and health to her cheeks. She learned 
later that he had kept to the forest until he 
reached where now is Walkerville, where he found 
a canoe and crossed to the American side. After 
the war there w^as great rejoicing, for the happy 
lovers were united.

CAPTAIN JEAN. 



A liegrend of the First Militia. 

ALEXIS Trotier des Ruisseaux belonged to a 
distinguished family of Quebec ; lie came to 
Detroit to Join his brother-in-law, the brave 
and chivalrous Picote DeBellestre, the last French 
Commandant of Fort Pontchartrain. Des Ruis- 
seaux here met and wedded the beautiful and as- 
cetic Catherine Godef roy de Marboeuf , whose pious 
deeds have come down in fragmentary tradi- 
tions to her brother's descendants, who to-day 
reside in Detroit, and who revere and honor the 
memory of their saintly ancestress. Alexis was 
the first trustee of Ste. Anne's Church, and the first 
captain of militia. 

In 1760, when the lily of France, which had 



198 Legends of Le Detroit. 

bloomed for sixty years on the fair soil of its 
adoption, drooped before tlie jSery standard of 
England, many of the old customs and traditions 
of the French regime lay cradled in its folded 
petals. 

It was not until 1805 that the militia system 
was resuscitated from the dust and cobwebs of 
the past, though an attempt was made in 1796 by 
Acting Gov. Sargeant. But Gren. Hull after or- 
ganizing the Territorial Government, formed the 
first regiment of militia. It consisted of eight 
companies, drawn from every part of the territory, 
except the District of Erie. Jean Cecire was 
among the first of the French habitants who 
joined the new militia. To the diplomatic pol- 
icy of the Americans, anxious to conciliate the 
French element, was he indebted for his rank of 
Captain in the First Regiment of Michigan. He 
never fully recovered from the shock of the honor, 
and became so thoroughly imbued with the im- 
portance of his position, that every detail of his 
dress and every action, bore the impress of this 
great event in his career. 

His conceit, pretentious manners, and exag- 
gerated self-importance, were endless sources of 
merriment to the old habitants, who possessed 
exquisite finesse in quickly detecting the foibles 



Legends of Le Detroit. 199 

of others, and were happy in their piqnante re- 
marks, to which the indescribable and expressive 
shrug of the shoulder, lent its humorous charm. 

Jean would frequently go to see the regular 
troops drill. Their severe discipline and military 
exactness sorely puzzled him, and he thought it 
must be owing to the words of command being 
given in English, in which there was a hidden 
magic. His knowledge of the language was al- 
most as limited as his use of the pen, though his 
ingenuity conquered the latter difficulty. The 
names of the men of his company were printed 
in order, so he used a pin to punch a hole after 
the name of the absentee. But that tongue of 
his, so facile, so easy to control in French, was 
positively frozen in English. By wonderful strug- 
gles he succeeded in thawing it into the semblance 
of broken English. 

The American officers stationed at the fort, to 
the great delight of Capt. Jean, would frequently 
request to be present at the drills, and the recital 
afterwards by a graceful and graphic tongue of 
these rare and quaint manoeuvres, awoke the 
echoes of the mess room. It is to be regretted 
that one officer at least, who had talent for

He would have won a debt of gratitude from 
even this unleisurely age.

The time of the general training had arrived, 
and Capt. Jean was ordered to drill his company 
on the commons. No haughty Scottish chieftain 
ever surveyed his tartan clan with prouder mien, 
or more happy feelings surging in his heart, than 
Jean his motley recruits. Some were in uni- 
form, others in the gay dress of the habitants, 
and their pieces and accoutrements represented 
every variety known to the history of arms. 

Gen. Hull was too exacting in his requirements 
in time of peace, and demanded the same nicety 
of order, dress, etc., as in the regulars, which 
caused anger and insurbordination. He forgot 
that these stepsons of France, though they in- 
herited the bravery and love of glory inseparable 
from the French character, had been placed in a 
strange position by the various changes of gov- 
ernment. They had been forced to adopt a pas- 
sive policy, which had buried their enthusiastic 
natures beneath a crust of indifference and indo- 
lence. Their easy going life had little prepared 
them to assume at once the rigid discipline of the 
camp which Hull tried to enforce, though gradu- 
ally they would have recognized its utility and 
quietly submitted. 

Capt. Jean ordered the Sergeant to call the roll. 
He immediately proceeded to obey, the Captain 
standing by in the full glory of regimentals.

After the roll was called and the absentees 
pricked the Captain proceeded to drill his com- 
pany. 



202 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Captain‚Äî "Marchee! Mes camarades, deux par 
deux (two and two) like oxen, and when you 
come to dat stump stop." 

They all made for the place and got there in a 
heap, looking, with their various colored dresses, 
like a rainbow on a spree. Disgusted at their 
awkwardness, the Captain gave them a few min- 
utes relaxation. Instead of resting ' 'au militaire, ' ' 
they rushed off, one to smoke his beloved pipe, 
another to polish his carbine, whilst others amused 
themselves sitting on the grass and telling about 
the races. 

The Captain called them to try again. This- 
time he said : ' ' Marchee as far as dat Soulier de 
bceuf (old shoe) in de road, den turn ! Right, 
gauche, left about ! Shoulder mus-^eefo ! Avanca 
done, back ! Drill fineesh ! " 

An English Sergeant drilled the company dur- 
ing the war of 1812, and was a source of great ad- 
miration to Capt. Jean. 

At the battle of Mongaugon Capt. Jean led his- 
company. They fought well and bravely, but h&amp; 
lost his Sergeant and his men began to waiver. 
Jean was brave but powerless to rally them, or 
make them fall in ranks. He forgot the few 
words of command he was master of, and great 
beads of perspiration stood on his brow. At last 
he broke forth : 



Legends of Le Detroit. 203 

"Fix yourself, as pauvre Jim did, den, "by Gar, 
follow me." 

Many years afterwards a son of Capt. Jean, 
who had inherited his father's military taste and 
some of his peculiarities, once met old Oshkosh, 
Black Hawk's celebrated lieutenant. 

The dusky warrior was quietly seated in one of 
the inns of the day, enjoying his calumet, envel- 
oped in a soft mist of smoke which wove his 
thoughts with the past. Suddenly a loud voice 
resounded, and a gay figure entered with a swag- 
gering bearing, rudely snapping the thread of 
Oshkosh' s reverie. Many were present who knew 
the old brave's aversion to the militia, and thought 
of amusing themselves at his expense ; so they 
introduced Lt. Cecire. From under his bushy 
eyebrows the Indian gazed at him and grunted 
forth : 

"Infantry?" 

"No," was the reply. 

"Dragoon?" 

"No." 

"Artillery?" 

"No." 

Pausing a moment to think if there were another 
branch of the service in which to locate the Lieu- 
tenant, suddenly a light dawned on the Indian's 



‚ñ†204 Legends of Le Detroit. 

mind. Hastily jumping np, he with a most dis- 
gusted expression hissed : 

"Melish?" 

"Yes," was the triumphant reply. 

"Oh, h ‚Äî 1," said Oshkosh, and rushed from the 
house. 



XXVII 

KENNETTE'S VISION. 



A Legrend of Spring^rells. 

A FEW years ago the figure of an old womaii 
was frequently seen on our principal streets, 
whose qnaint dress, erect bearing and keen 
piercing eyes, challenged the attention of every 
passer-by. She seemed to be a relic of a past age, 
who had strayed by accident into the present and 
was at variance with her surroundings. To-day, 
after slumbering for fifteen years, her restless 
spirit seems to revive and cause agitation in civil 
as well as political circles. 

Marie Louise Thebault, generally called " Ken- 
nette," well known to the older portion of our 
French community and by tradition to its younger 
members, dwelt in a little old wooden house on 



206 Legends of Le Detroit. 

tlie River road, opposite the Lafferty homestead. 
A stately elm threw its majestic shadow over the 
humble dwelling, seeming to shield it from rude 
vrinter blasts and to protect it from the summer's 
intense sun. Alone she lived here like a hermit. 
Her sister had married against her wishes, for 
Kennette was no advocate of matrimony. She be- 
lieved in woman' s rights ; was a sort of pioneer 
in that doctrine among the people of those times, 
and to-day would have been a powerful ally to 
the leading spirits of the question. 

A distinguished writer says: "Show me a 
man's room and I will tell you his character." 
Kennette' s dress forcibly illustrated the applica- 
tion of the remark. It was stamped by her strong 
individuality. At all seasons she wore a calico 
dress, rather scant, short enough not only to 
clear the ground, but to bring out in bass-relief an 
ankle whose outline freed it from all suggestive- 
ness of symmetry. Hooks and eyes, and even 
buttons, were superfluous luxuries when pins 
could be substituted, and failing these a thorn 
would answer. A red handkerchief around her 
neck was crossed on her breast ; a coarse cotton 
cap with a deep friU, innocent of starch and 
fluting, emphasized each movement of that decided 
head ; a check sunbonnet for outside wear, a blue 
umbrella and a pair of stout shoes of her own 



Legends of Le Detroit. 207 

manufacture, completed a costume as character- 
istic as it was unique. 

She seemed to scorn the usual gentler accom- 
plishments of her sex, yet with a strange incon- 
sistency frequently found in positive natures, she 
iated man, but adopted his pursuits. Never did 
her voice keep time to the music of the spinning 
wheel, nor did the steel needles flash through 
those fingers knitting stockings in which so 
many weave the history of their past, or build * 
‚ñ†castles for the future. Seated on a wooden bench, 
vdth all the cobbler's implements, she would vol- 
unteer to make shoes for the children and warrant 
their durability, and even the most pronounced 
hoyden found Miss Kennette' s sabots piece de re- 
sistance, which defied everything save beauty. 

No cat ever basked in the warmth of her hearth, 
no cow stood in her stall, no dog barked a joyous 
welcome as she crossed the threshold of her 
‚ñ†dreary and lonesome home. These were luxuries 
only for the wealthy, she said. Her means were 
more than sufficient to gratify her simple tastes 
and to allow her some indulgences, but she was 
penurious to a miserly extent. The neighbors 
along the River road all knew her well, and al- 
ways gave her vegetables and fruits. Her evenings 
were invariably spent out to save light and fuel, 
and it was a rare treat and a token of particular 



208 Legends of Le Dei/roit. 

good will if Miss Kennette brought her violin. She 
had a good ear for music, and with cultivation 
might have been an excellent performer, but her 
untutored efforts were rather crude. The children 
would cluster around her at a respectful dis- 
tance, for Miss Kennette was a warm advocate of 
the doctrine that ' ' children should be seen, not 
heard." Woe to the little urchin whose percept- 
ive powers were too keen and who dared to ask why- 
Miss Kennette used so much rosin, and was al- 
ways shifting comers, complaining one was too 
warm, another too cool for her violin, and why 
she did not make it speak like G-eorge Maison- 
ville's (a noted fiddler in those days). A tingling 
sensation and a peculiar redness of the ear warned 
the luckless boy not to repeat his questions. 

She read much, and mostly works that tended 
to render her skeptical in religious matters. She 
had no patience with those who told her wonder- 
ful stories of apparitions. She was always ready 
for an argument, and would emphasize her dec- 
larations with expressions which, though original 
were more forcible than elegant. Toward the close 
of her life an incident happened which invested 
her with more than usual interest, caused a de- 
cided change in her religious belief and left its- 
impress upon her character. There are many still 
living who have heard her relate it and who, know- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 209' 

ing the strong, self-reliant nature of the woman,, 
could not help being deeply impressed. 

It was a bright moonlight night, and Kennette 
was spending the evening with a neighbor who 
lived near, and amusing all, as usual, by her quaint 
and piquante conversation. She was relating how 
she had allowed an elderly friend of hers to rent 
a room in her house, so that by the arrangement 
she would not only get a little rent, but could use 
the fire and light of her boarder ; that this person 
was always preaching to her and destroyed all 
her pleasure, and that if her instincts of econ- 
omy were not so well developed, she would not 
go near her. "It is not pleasant," she said, "to 
be told that the books I read are wicked, that they 
instill poison into my heart, and that when I am 
old I will be stranded on the shore of remorse and 
despair. Well, to hush her up I made an agree- 
ment. 'I don't believe in hell or purgatory,' I 
said, ' so if you die first come back ; if I should, I 
will return. Just appear and I will know that 
there is such a place.' " 

The bargain was made, and Kennette for a while 
sunned herself in the borrowed warmth of another's 
fire and had contentment. But the restless Ken- 
nette soon quarreled with the boarder, a good, 
pious soul, and told her she would never forgive 
her for some imaginary wrong she fancied the old 



210 Legends of Le Detroit. 

woman had done her. Shortly afterwards the 
boarder died, and Kennette stood inflexibly and 
sternly beside the dying bedside and said she 
would not forgive, but their compact would hold. 

Whilst she was talking to her neighbors one 
evening and sipping cider, of which she was very 
fond, one of the boys of the house returning 
from town, asked Miss Kennette why she left a 
light burning in her house, for knowing the old 
woman's miserly habits, he had thought it strange. 
Jumping up and seizing a poker, she said she 
would go over and find out who dared enter her 
habitation. Others accompanied her. JSTothing 
but darkness reigned there, although the boy 
said positively he had seen a light ; they thought 
probably it was the light of a fisherman's boat 
passing on the river, and dismissed the subject. 
But night after night the same occurrence took 
place and people spoke about it and avoided 
passing near the old house. It always happened 
on an evening when Miss Kennette was away. 

Worried by the reports, and having witnessed 
this shifting light and searched every where for it, 
Miss Kennette determined to discover the cause, 
for she was not at all superstitious nor afraid of 
anything. 

One evening she returned earlier than usual, 
softly let herself in by the back door and imme- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 211 

diately retired. Hardly had she composed her- 
self to sleep, when she saw the reflection of a dim 
light on the wall at the head of the stairs. The 
upper room was not divided and the staircase was 
in the center. The light grew larger and largef, 
as if a person were carrying it np the stairs. 
Seated bolt upright in her bed, which was in a 
comer of the room near the west window, Ken- 
nette watched for the solution of a mystery which 
had so long baffled her. A stranger to fear, she 
was cool and collected, and patiently waited the 
developments. At last the light seemed to have 
arrived on the top step. It was no. candle, no 
lantern, but a peculiar vivid white light. It 
glided along the wall and as it came nearer to her 
bed, it suddenly assumed the outlines of a figure 
draped in clouds. Then a tremor ran through 
her. Her blood became chilled; new sensations 
crept over her. Rousing herself she rubbed her 
eyes, saw she was not dreaming and realized that 
it was no idle fancy but a fearful reality. Slowly 
was the apparition gliding along towards her. See- 
ing she must do something to arrest its progress, 
she said : " Come no nearer ; I know you. I believe 
and I forgive," and as the mysterious light came, 
so it disappeared. 

From that day forward all noticed a change. 
The dark hair was bleached, wrinkles were writ- 



212 



Legends of Le Detroit. 



ten on that stern face and a softer expression 
played over it. She returned to the faithful per- 
formance of her spiritual duties, and the Nemesis 
which had haunted her steps appeared satisfied, 
for the weird light was seen no more in her des- 
olate home. 




XXVIII 

THE FISHERMAN OF GROSSE POINTE. 



A liegend of the Grand Uarais. 

GROSSE POIISTTE was peculiarly congenial to 
the early settlers by its position, its beauty 
and otlier advantages. Perhaps a shadow 
of sentiment rested upon it in its suggestion of 
picturesque Normandy, souvenirs of which were 
tenderly cherished by the pioneers. Wherever 
we go we carry the image of our early surround- 
ings, and unconsciously a new place or scene 
appeals to us, by the resemblance it bears to this 
revered picture. The imagination, like a skillful 
diplomat, catches its clue from the heart, and 
weaves its alluring net-work of enchantment. 
Even inanimate objects contribute to this decep- 
tion, for we remain attached to the down on which 



214 Legends of Ze Detroit. 

our prosperity has slumbered, and still more to 
tlie straw on wMch. we counted the days of our 
adversity. 

The waters of Lake Ste. Claire grow shallow as 
they near the shores of Grosse Pointe, as if un- 
willing to break the harmonious silence by harsher 
sounds than the low breathing of its waves on the 
pebbles, thus affording a safe haven from severe 
storms, and allowing the timorous to stray a great 
distance out without fear of a worse fate than a, 
ducking. Here, as along ' ' La Cote du Nord Est, ' ' 
fishing was extensively carried on, and with the 
same avidity as at present. An old tradition says 
that here two bachelor brothers resided, whose 
skiU in the manufacture of nets and whose suc- 
cessful hauls of fish were widely knovsTi, Hypolite 
and Pierrish Tremblay by name. The elder was 
eurnamed Le Gascon, from the wonderful things 
he reported having seen, and from his supersti- 
tious nature. They exchanged their daily catch of 
fish with their neighbors for corn, I'huile d'ours 
(bear's oil), a dainty edible then, and other nec- 
essaries. 

Their pursuits, like the commercial ventures of 
modern times, were subject to fluctuations. One 
autumn their nets were frozen into the ice by a 
sudden sharp cold. When the early spring thaw 
came, it broke up the nets and carried theha awav. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 215 

More provident than the average fun-loving Ca- 
nadian, they had sufficient "livres tours" (the 
currency of the day) to .begin anew. Somehow 
luck deserted them and appeared to have drift- 
ed away in the broken meshes of the old nets, 
for morning and evening when they drew in the 
seine it was empty, save for a few meagre herring 
and himgry catfish, instead of the succulent white 
fish and muskaUonge.* The prospect seemed dark 
for the fishermen, and a plenary court of Lent 
would soon reign if matters continued thus much 
longer. 

"Let, us consult le bon pere," said Pierrish, 
the younger, after the brothers had been discuss- 
ing the precarious situation. "Bah ! " answered 
HypoUte with a feeble expression. He was much 
given to profanity, had received several rebukes 
on that score from the priest, and hence was not 
friendly toward him. "He can do nothing ; some 
enemy has ' donn¬ße le sort' (bewitched) our fishery, 
it is no use trying to do anything ; I am going 
elsewhere, you may remain if you wish." So the 
brothers separated, one to search for new fishing 
grounds, the other to consult the priest. Pierrish 
laid the situation before the cure, who listened 
attentively, then said, ' ' Mon fils, choose St. Pat- 

*Muskanoge, corrupted Into MuskaUonge, is the finest flsh of 
the lakes. 



316 Legends of Le Det/roit. 

rick as your partner and divide each day's catch 
with him, selling the Saint's portion for the poor. "* 

On his homeward way, Pierrish revolved in his 
mind the advice of the priest, and made a solemn 
vow to follow it strictly. Full of hope, he cast 
his nets that evening, promising it to be the 
Saint's portion ; the morning haul he would mod- 
estly reserve for himself. So when the net came 
in it was filled with fish, and while his catch in 
the morning was empty, the Saint's was always 
full. He pondered over the matter and was 
strongly tempted to keep the Saint's portion. 
Hypolite taunted him with his ill-luck, yet Pier- 
rish remembered his vow and conscientiously 
brought the fish for sale, giving the proceeds to 
the poor. Finding that this mode was ruining 
him, he again visited the priest and told him of 
his misfortune. The priest, after hearing his 
story, said : 

" Your simple faith and honesty will meet with 
its reward. Divide the proceeds of each net with 
your partner. You have stood a test of honesty 
which few in your position could have done." 
From that time Pierrish became so successful that 

* It was a beautiful custom then to bring to the church door the 
first fruits, fish or game, of the season, selling them to the highest 
bidder, the proceeds going to the poor, and for masses to relieve 
the suffering souls of purgatory. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 217 

he was known as "the lucky fisherman of Grosse 
Pointe." 

Hypolite met with indifferent success, was al- 
ways warning his brother, and looked with dis- 
trust upon this saintly partnership. His super- 
stitious nature always conjured up some evil 
omen. ' ' You wiU be inveigled into the lake and , 
turned into a fish. Do you not remember the 
Indian legend relative to the origin of the poisson 
blanc (white fish), formed of the brains of a woman 
whom the Manitou had loved for a whUe, then 
‚ñ†cracked her skull on the rocks of Sault Ste. 
Marie? Your partner, St. Patrick, wiU play 
you a trick. Did he not eat pork chops on Fri- 
day by dipping them in water and changing them 
into orthodox trout % Beware ! ' ' 

Pierrish would only smile at his vagaries. One 
‚ñ†day he was startled by Hypolite rushing into the 
house in a state of nervous excitement, wringing 
his hands and saying : 

"Some terrible disaster is to befall one of us." 

" Explain yourself," said Pierrish. 

"Well," said Hypolite, " as I was leaving Bap- 
tiste Cochois, five miles from here, the cock crew 
and Baptiste said, ' You will meet company on 
the road, that cock tells you.' I was trotting 
.along in my charrette (cart) when I spied a lady's 
muff by the wayside. Thinking it was strange 



218 Legends of Le Detroit. 

to see sucli an article at this mild season, I got 
out to secure it. As soon as I approached it the 
muff began rolling. Becoming angry, and thinking 
the motion was caused by the wind, I still pursued 
it, but in vain ; it eluded my grasp. Thoroughly 
frightened, I jumped into the charrette and trotted 
away as fast as I could, but the terrible thing, 
followed me and actually jumped into and out of 
the cart. It must be the Manchon Roulant."* 

Pierrish said, "If you had had holy water 
instead of brandy in that bottle, you could 
have exorcised that spirit. Go back where you 
saw the Manchon Roulant ; if it is stiU there, 
cross yourself and boldly walk up to it, and be- 
fore attempting to pick it up ask, ' What day of 
the month is Christmas day?' "t Hypolite, in 
fear and trembling, returned to the place, and 

* Manchon Roulant ( Rolling Muff). A superstition devoutly- 
believed in many years ago, and still traditional among the habit- 
ants of Grosse Pointe. 

f There were said to be two means to exempt oneself from any 
evil consequences arising from the tricks of the most malicious of 
goblins. The first was, on meeting the goblin to ask it, "What 
day of the month is Christmas day? " The goblin, which is never 
very well up in the calendar, will reply by asking the same ques- 
tion. Woe betide the traveller if he hesitates in answering. The- 
second means was by placing two sticks in the form of a cross- 
on meeting a goblin. 

Parents were very particular in teaching their children to re- 
member the day Christmas came on, to protect them from the feuj 
f oUet, the Loup Garou and other goblins. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 219' 

sure enough the dreaded object was there. Fer- 
vently crossing himself, he cautiously approached 
the mysterious thing, which, strange to say re- 
mained immoveable. Closer he approached the 
mysterious ball of fur, and with eager, out- 
stretched hands was ready to seize it, when sud- 
denly bethinking himself of the question to put 
to it, in his excitement he blurted forth his usual 
oaths. Instantly there streamed forth a counter 
blast as from a fiery furnace, and a terrible odor 
filled the air, which struck him full in the face. 
Hypolite, nearly suffocated, in two bounds reached 
the lake, and as soon as he had recovered con- 
sciousness exclaimed, "La bSte puante."* His 
brother impressed it upon him that it was a pun- 
ishment for his profanity, and whenever after- 
wards the Manchon Roulant was mentioned as a 
marvelous thing, it was observed, that Hypolite 
suddenly disappeared.

the devil), skunk, or pole-cat.

THE GHOST OF MONGATJGON. 



A Xiegeud of Hull's Surrender. 

THE dark, blackened ruins of a city, its poor 
stricken habitants gazing with tear-stained 
eyes on the gray ashes of their homes and 
hopes. Such was the scene which greeted the 
newly appointed Territorial Governor Hull, Stan- 
ley Griswold, the Secretary, and Augustus Wood- 
ward, the Chief Justice, on their arrival at Detroit 
the morning of the 6th of June, 1805. The night 
before a destructive fire had swept away every 
vestige of the old French town. Its quaint houses 
‚Ä¢constructed of square logs, the steep roofs pierced 
with dormer windows and crossed with ladders in 
case of fire, its narrow streets of sixteen feet and 
sidewalks a foot wide formed of hewn logs, its 



Legends of Le Detroit. 221 

Norman and Indian relics, the qnaint old furni- 
ture valuable only for its association with, the 
past, decrees, deeds, letters and documents price- 
less legacies to the historian, perished in that 
night. Fate seemed to say, "This is a holocaust 
to departed memories. The cross of St. George, 
the lily of France have been dismantled, but the 
bright stars gleam like gems of promise through 
the tattered shreds. Cheer up, the past claims 
only your tears, the future will bring to you pros- 
perity and happiness which you have sought in 
vain for an hundred years." Judge Woodward 
recognized the moment as a propitious one to win 
the hearts of the French settlers, and thus elo- 
quently championed their rights, when it became 
necessary to divide the land and partition it among 
the dispossessed habitants: "He will not argue 
with you on your laws, or your forms, or your 
systems of policy and government. He looka 
only for that pittance of soil on which, perhaps, 
he drew his breath. He cannot be intimidated 
by threats, nor be induced to part with his lands, 
the hopes of himself and family, by any allure- 
ments of money. Tell him that you will dispos- 
sess him ; he folds his hands with a pious resigna- 
tion and commits the event to God. Amidst the 
collisions of nations, the incessant din of arms, 
the tide of revolution, he has lost a country to love 



222 Legends of Le Dei/roit. 

and by wtich to be loved in return. Cast among 
strangers to his language, his jurisprudence and 
religion, he asks only a small, obscure spot upon 
the earth on which to spend in peace the fleeting 
transit of his existence." 

A new town had sprung from the ruins of the 
old one, and the poor country-tossed settlers had 
thought that at last they were anchored in peace. 
The tocsin of war was sounded again in 1812. 
Gov. Hull, enfeebled by age, and perhaps too 
friendly toward the enemy, was defending the 
beleaguered garrison against a powerful force of 
British with their countless savage allies. The 
brave troops, under Cass, McArthur and other 
gallant leaders, were ready to shed their blood for 
the defence of the settlement. The militia, long 
versed in Indian warfare, felt confident of repel- 
ling the foe. A series of preliminary skirmishes 
were constantly going on. It was a trying crisis 
for the habitants ; many families were divided, 
members of each being arrayed on opposite sides. 
Angus Mcintosh, a Scotch gentleman, dwelt with 
his charming family on the Canadian shore. His 
daughter Marie was beloved by a young Canadian 
officer named Muir, but who was too timid to de- 
clare his love. 

On the 9th of August an attack was to be made 
at Mongaugon on a body of Americans by a force 



Legends of Le Detroit. 223 

of British troops and Wyandot Indians under 
their celebrated chieftain, Walk in the Water. 
The command to which Lt. Muir belonged was 
assigned the post of honor and peril, the forlorn 
hope in the projected expedition. He felt that 
now was the time to tell his love, that he conld 
fight better knowing that he bore Marie's color 
and was cheered by her smile. Obtaining a short 
leave, he presented himself at the Mcintosh man- 
sion and found his lady-love alone. He pleaded 
Ms cause with all a soldier's ardor. Some un- 
accountable freak of coquetry made her turn an 
indifferent ear to his passionate appeal. She had 
been annoyed at his timid wooing, and reasoning 
with a girlish logic, was determined to retaliate. 
The young officer did not understand these tactics, 
and overcome by the disappointment to his cher- 
ished hopes, he hastily left the house. Marie 
thought he was only piqued. " He certainly 
must know that I love him," she argued, "men 
are so stupid and matter-of-fact ; they take 
months to make up their minds to woo a girl, and 
if she do not immediately say 'yes' feel them- 
selves aggrieved and wounded." Seeing that he 
‚Ä¢did not return she became anxious, and going to 
the door, called him, but only the mocking echo of 
his steed' s retreating hoofs returned to her ear. 
That evening when she retired to her room, the 



224: Legends of Le Det/roit. 

shadow of a great impending woe seemed to hover 
abont her. The long, weary hours of the night 
were measured by her tears and self-reproaches. 
Towards morning exhausted nature asserted her 
claim, and the anguish-rent heart lay in her em- 
brace. But brief was the slumber. Marie was 
awakened by the sound of muffled footsteps near 
her bedside. Hastily drawing aside the curtain she 
saw her lover standing near her couch, the bright 
moonlight revealing every detail of his figure. 
His face was that of a corpse, whilst blood oozed 
from a ghastly wound in his forehead. A faint- 
ness seized her as she heard a far-away voice say, 
" Fear not, Marie, I fell to-night in honorable battle. 
I was shot through the head. My body lies in a 
thicket. I beg you, rescue it from the despoiling 
hand of the savage and from the wild beasts of 
the forest. The Americans will not long exult. 
Traitors sit around their camp fires and listen to 
their councils. Our blood has not been shed in 
vain. The standard of old England will float 
again over Detroit. Farewell, may you be happy.' ' 
As he spoke he touched lightly her right hand. 
At that terrible sensation of coldness born only of 
the grave, she sank into unconsciousness. 

The sun was flooding her room when she re- 
turned to her senses, and to a dim remembrance 
of a most frightful dream. Trying to recall each.

detail she suddenly glanced at her hand, and to 
her horror saw that it had been branded by the 
phantom touch; there was its impress left by deep, 
dark marks. It was not then a dream but a. 
reality, and a sacred mission had been intrusted 
to her. Hurriedly throwing on her garments she 
called for her horse, bade a servant follow her, 
and rode at full speed to Brock' s camp at Maiden. 
Here aU was in a state of commotion. She found 
Walk in the Water, whom she knew well, as- 
tonished him by telling him about the battle, 
and induced him to paddle her in a canoe over 
the river to the battle field. Here, in the thicket, 
with a bullet hole in his head, she found her dead 
lover, and ordered the savages to take his remains 
to Sandwich for burial. On that sad anniversary 
for many years afterwards, the ghostly form of a 
British officer could be seen gliding through the 
shady groves of Mongaugon towards the river. 
Marie won later the love of a noble man who had 
heard of her early romantic story. Ever after- 
wards she wore a black glove on her right hand, 
and every 9th of August, dressed as a mendicant, 
sandal footed, she went from house to house from 
Sandwich to Windsor asking alms for the poor. 
It was a penance self-imposed in atonement for 
her pride and coquetry.

16th of August, whilst Judges Moran and With- 
erell (then mere boys, but who in their patriotism 
had enrolled themselves in Jacques Campeau's 
company) were on guard, they noticed a white 
flag suddenly hoisted. The excitement was in- 
tense when it was learned that it was the signal 
of surrender. So unexpected, so uncalled for 
an event caused the soldiers to doubt it. Gen. 
Cass, in his indignation, broke his sword in pref- 
erence to giving it up to the enemy, an example 
followed by many others. As the British troops 
marched in triumph into the fort, the long line of 
French militia stood with bowed heads and tears of 
shame coursing down their bronzed faces, as for 
the fourth time they saw the flag they felt so able 
to defend changed for that of their hereditary 
Joes. '

THE EVE OF EPIPHANY. 



A Legend of Perry's Victory. 



I HE visitor to Detroit's "Hotel de Yille" 
(City Hall) will notice on either side of 
the main entrance, two "long nines" 
mounted on stone carriages. These grim sen- 
tinels are the trophies of the great "Battle of 
Lake Erie." The prond Mistress of the Seas for 
the first time in her history was forced to sur- 
render an entire fleet, and to children whose grand- 
sires she had cradled. Young America points to 
these cannons with pride and a glow of patriot- 
ism steals into his heart as he reads the thrilling 
account of the battle. The grey haired Octogen- 
arian tenderly pats the guns and recalls memories. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 229 

of days that have gone, social pleasures, friends of 
Ms youth, and beauty mouldering in the grave. 

In 1801, some years before the outbreak of 
hostilities with England, the habitants of &gt; these 
'‚ñ†'‚ñ† Cotes " had, with returning prosperity resumed 
m.uch of their old time gaiety. In Winter the ex- 
‚ñ†citing races on the ice between the swift French 
ponies ; in the Spring the annual crop of wed- 
dings with the long procession of "charrettes" 
(French carts) laden with a joyous, light-hearted 
freight of gay girls ; and in Autumn the corn 
hustings, were again in vogue. Each feast 
day of the church had its peculiar and appro- 
priate customs handed down from their Norman 
ancestry. 

It was on the eve of one of these, the Epiph- 
any, that in a hospitable old mansion on the 
present site of Windsor, was assembled a brilliant 
party of stately dames, fair demoiselles and courtly 
cavaliers, mingled with the elite of the young 
Scotch element. There seemed to be some latent 
chord of sympathy between these brave High- 
landers and the French, for intermarriages were 
of frequent occurrence. 

The table was laid for supper which was to be 
followed by games, fortune telling, etc. Seated 
near the head of the table, between two dashing 
gallants who had vied with each other for her 



230 Legends of Le Detroit. 

bright glances, was a Kentucky widow on a visit 
to the settlement. Her husband had been killed 
a few years previous in one of the Indian raids, 
leaving her with a merry little boy to soothe her 
grief. 

The large Epiphany cake was cut by the host, 
each lady present taking a piece. It was then 
customary to put in it a ring and a small white 
bean. The lady to whose lot the ring fell was 
crowned queen. The holder of the bean gave the 
entertainment the following year, and acted on the 
present occasion, as maid of honor. Madame 
Fairbairne found the ring and Julie Maisonville 
the bean. It was then necessary for the fortunate 
queen to select the king of Epiphany. Mad- 
ame Fairbairne blushed as her eyes wandered from 
one to the other of her two gallants, and she said, 
"If we choose Monsieur Grant, we shall offend 
Monsieur Brevoort, if we choose Monsieur Bre- 
voort we shall offend Monsieur Grant. We shall 
select the one who is to become the most distin- 
guished, and to ascertain this we decree that our 
noble Dame D'Honneur, Mile. Maisonville, shall 
take the grounds from the pot of tea and tell the 
fortune of all three of us. You know that she is 
a witch herself and in league with all the witches, 
so it is our royal pleasure that she shall explain 



Legends of Le Detroit. 231 

to lis what say tlie fates, and to their decree we 
must bow." 

A murmur of assent greeted the queen' s prop- 
osition, and a large platter being brought Mile. 
Julie, with many incantations in a wild jumble of 
words learned from the Indian magicians, turned 
the contents of the teapot out into the platter, 
where the leaves assumed strange and wild forms 
that only the initiated could read. In those days 
clairvoyance and mind reading were but little 
known, and there was more of a disposition to 
impute effects to supernatural than to natural 
causes. Witchcraft was the name then given to 
modern spiritualism. Fortune telling was fre- 
quently and devoutly believed in, especially when 
the person was the seventh daughter of a seventh 
daughter. In those times of a plethora of chil- 
dren, this was no uncommon thing. Julie was the 
mystic seventh daughter, and she was noted 
throughout the colony for her wonderful powers 
of divination. Whilst her beauty was of a seduc- 
tive, fascinating order, there seemed at times to be 
something beyond human ken in her lustrous eye. 
Though universally beloved there were many 
who looked with awe on her mysterious powers. 
After eagerly scanning the tea grounds she 
closed her eyes a moment as if communing 
with herself, and heaving a deep sigh said in 



232 Legends of Le Detroit. 

a chanting tone to her profoundly interested 
audience: "My friends, I see here wonderful 
things. On this holy night of Epiphany when 
three wise men (the three kings) came from the 
East and learned the secrets of the future, it is 
fitting that I, the humble maid of our gracious 
queen, should reveal to you at her bidding what fate 
has ordained. This line, ' ' pointing toward the plat- 
ter, " represents Monsieur Brevoort, and this Mon- 
sieur Grant, whilst this one describes the fate of 
our noble queen. These two young men are destin- 
ed to wonderful careers. To-day they are intimate 
friends, later you will see them contending with 
one another but not alone. A great war is indi- 
cated accompanied by terrible bloodshed. The 
contest between these two seems to be on the 
water, the victory for a time is evenly balanced 
but later it seems to belong to you. Monsieur Bre- 
voort. Your line of life is not ended. Monsieur 
Grant ; you will both settle down by the lakes 
around happy firesides." Suddenly the proph- 
etess turned deadly pale, as she scanned more 
critically the tea grounds. "I see here by your 
line, honored queen, the figure of a tomahawk ; 
great trouble will come to you through the Indians. 
A little off-shoot of your line seems to cross that 
of Monsieur Grant, and ends with many branches. 
This, gracious qiieen, is all I see in the shadowy 



Legends of Le Detroit. 233 

iuture." The queen then addressed her loyal 
subjects as follows : " My children, the words of 
the sibyl indeed perplex me, and in the absence 
of the wise kings of the East to whom I could 
appeal, I am compelled to decide for myself. 
Although Monsieur Brevoort seems to carry off 
the palm of victory, yet my line seems to cross 
that of Monsieur G-rant. My ambition prompts me 
to select Monsieur Brevoort as my king, but fate 
seems to point in another direction. On two such 
charming cavaliers I would not bring the trouble 
that is in store for me. It is evident I need a 
strong arm to protect me, a king with an army at 
his back. I therefore choose as king of Epiphany 
(here her eyes glanced around until they fell upon 
‚ñ†Col. Brush standing near the door) the gallant Col- 
onel of the Legionary Corps. His veterans will nev- 
er suffer harm to come to their queen." At this Col. 
Brush came forward and was crowned king. The 
‚ñ†company, charmed with the graceful manner of 
the young widow, applauded her choice. The fes- 
tivities were kept up to a late hour, but the union 
‚ñ†of the king and queen extended no further than 
Epiphany' s eve. She soon returned with her little 
:son to her home on the Kentucky border. 

As the inspired Franklin had said years before, 

" The way of the Revolution has been fought, the 

^ar of Independence has still to be fought," the

long smouldering element at last burst its bonds. 
Detroit disgracefully surrendered at the lirst onset. 
An English fleet built on the river, controlled tha 
lakes, but the dying words of the heroic Lawrence 
were impressed on the American minds : "Don't 
give up the ship." Under the direction of the dar- 
ing young Rhode Islander, Oliver Hazard Perry, a 
fleet was hastily constructed at Presque Isle (now 
Erie) on the south shore of Lake Erie. On the 
10th of September, 1813, from his look-out on Gib- 
raltar Island,* Put-in-Bay, Perry discovered the 
British fleet sailing out of the Detroit River ta 
attack him. It was composed of six vessels 
carrying seventy guns. The Americans had nine 
vessels carrying tifty-four guns. In weight of 
metal and efiiciency, the British fleet seemed su- 
perior and its commander, Barclay, was one of 
Nelson's veterans. Young Perry flung out his 
ensign with the legend, " Don't give up the ship," 
and was determined that day to conquer or die. 
When twilight had set in that night, American, 
valor had enabled him to write this immortal 
despatch from his ship moored off one of the- 
Three Sisters Islands :* " We have met the enemy, 

*Now the summer residence of Jay Cooke. 

*Three Sisters Island, said to have received the name from three- 
Indian squaws whose tongues were so sharp that their father for 
peace sake had to exile them to three islands near the mouth of

and they are ours, ‚Äî two ships, two brigs, one 
schooner, one sloop. ' ' This was the decisive blow of 
the war. Harrison soon afterwards drove the cow- 
ardly Proctor from Detroit and unfurled again the 
starry flag, where long may it wave. 

In command of the marines on the American 
fleet was Lt. Henry Brevoort, of the 3rd regiment 
of U. S. Infantry detailed for duty on the fleet. 
Later he was known as "Commodore" Brevoort.^ 
Congress voted him a medal for his gallantry and 
his grateful country will ever cherish his memory. 
Commodore Alexander Grant commanded one of 
the British vessels in the action. He married 
Miss Barthe at Detroit, and after the war built his 
residence, called "Grant's Castle," at Grosse 
Pointe, where it was the scene of much hospi- 
tality. 

Shortly after one of the Indian raids into Ohio 
and Kentucky, Mrs. Grant heard that a band of 
savages had encamped at Belle Isle. They were 
going to hold a "powwow" to celebrate their 
exploits, and to torture and burn a young white 
captive whose mother they had killed. 

The Commodore was away, but his wife' s moth-

Sister. 

‚ô¶Commodore Brevoort married Miss Catherine Navarre, named 
from her aunt, the mother of General Alexander Macomb.

erly instincts were roused, and knowing the love 
and esteem of the Indians for her family, she de- 
termined to make an effort to save the poor boy 
from so terrible a fate. She was rowed to Belle 
Isle, made her way to the camp and asked the 
amount of the ransom for the child.* The Indians, 
who were making preparations for their horrible 
feast, would not at first listen to her. The cburag- 
eous woman was not to be baffled, and at last partly 
by lavish presents and partly by threats that the 
black gown (priest) would bring some calamity 
on them, she succeeded in her mission. The 
little boy was brought home and adopted by his 
humane deliverer, who already had a large family 
(ten daughters) of her own. On the Commodore' s 
return his good wife described to him her visit to 
the Indian encampment and its gratifying results. 
' ' What did the Indians call him ? ' ' suddenly ex- 
claimed the Commodore. "I think they called 
him fair bairn or ' pretty boy ' " she replied. The 
‚ñ†old veteran bowed his head, whilst memory was 
busy weaving the broken links of the prophecy 
on Epiphany eve, many years before. 

*See chap, on Grants. The grandchild of the little boy still 
lives and remembers his mother's account of Mrs. Grant's trip to 
Orosse Isle.

KISHKAUKOU. 



A Legrend of the Chippewas. 

IT WAS an evening in the early spring of 1815 ;. 
the moon had just risen and was flooding with 
soft radiance the restless waters of Saginaw 
Bay. On the banks was an open clearing fringed 
by the dark, primeval forest. Here and there were 
scattered tents covered with variegated mats, or 
formed of the fragrant boughs of the spruce. 

In the center of the encampment was a bright 
fire, the flickering light from which mingling with 
that of the moon caused weird expressions to play 
over the dusky faces of the Indian warriors, who 
sat round in a semicircle. They were smoking in 
calm and deliberative silence and listening with. 



238 Legends of Le Detroit. 

solemn attention to a speaker who was explaining" 
the object of the council. 

In such assemblies decorum was never broken ; 
the etiquette which forbade one speaker to inter- 
rupt the other was strictly enforced ; calls to order 
were unknown. 

At a little distance, closely guarded and with 
pinioned arms, stood an Indian prisoner, whose 
murder of a young brave of the tribe had caused 
this council. The squaw and children of the vic- 
tim were the acciisers, and demanded the fulfill- 
ment of the code, which was blood for blood, for 
according to Indian tradition, the soul of the 
deceased would be excluded from the happy 
hunting grounds of his ancestors, until the act of 
atonement had been made. There was something 
impressive in the passive grandeur of the Indian' s 
stolid stoicism, in his supreme indifference to the 
deliberations of the council, as if it were another's 
fate it was deciding. 

There seemed to be a division of opinion ; dis- 
senting grunts were heard, when suddenly a war- 
rior of powerful form arose, who gliding towards 
the prisoner, ended all hesitancy by burying his 
tomahawk in his brain. Then, brandishing his 
reeking weapon towards the petrified group, 
robbed of the force of the fearful reality by the 
svTiftness of the blow, he left the council. It was 



Legends of Le Detroit. 239 

Kishkaukou, the celebrated Chippewa chief, 
whose savage barbarity had made his name a 
terror all along the lakes, and the bare mention 
of which blanched the cheeks of the bravest. 
l^^ot a murmur of disapproval was heard ; his will 
ruled supreme. "Le roi le veut," was sufficient, 
.and the warriors drew their blankets over their 
heads and filed one after another from the council. 

Kishkaukou was reproved afterwards by an 
intrepid white for having broken the law by his 
peculiar mode of legislation, and replied with 
a ready wit which equalled that of Moliere' s f ag- 
ot boy : "I have altered the law." 

The brave, notwithstanding his savage cruelties, 
was not impervious to Cupid' s darts. Whilst in 
the vicinity of the River Huron (now the Clinton) 
he met a charming half-breed, Monique, who had 
the misfortune to make him the captive of her 
pretty eyes. Kishkaukou' s manner of wooing, 
added to the terrible stories told of him, was not 
calculated to find favor in a timid maiden' s heart, 
and it was not strange that she preferred another 
and more gentle lover, Louizon, the clerk of Judge 
Eielly. 

Kishkaukou soon discovered his rival, and with 
his startling idea of facilitating legislation, dis- 
posed of Louizon as he had of the Indian cap- 
tive and carried the maiden away. But he soon 



24:0 Legends of Le Detroit. 

discovered that the law was not to be altered by 
the capricious will of a lawless despot, and the 
Chippewa chief was obliged to hide. For some 
time he eluded the vigilance of that power which 
he had so outraged. Trusting to his cunning and 
strategy, and to the terror of his name, he was 
rash enough to come near Detroit and encamp in 
Col. Louis Beauf ait' s orchard, now known as the 
"Bagg Farm." He was followed by his suite, 
consisting of several of his squaws and Indians, 
for he always travelled en grand seigneur, and, 
like Sapor of . Persia; mounted his horse 
from the kneeling backs of his slaves. Among 
them was Monique, who, though compelled to 
follow the murderer of her lover, stiU cherished 
revenge, and only waited a favorable opportunity 
to punish him for his crime. Her very repugnance 
only served to- inflame Kishkaukou' s love, and he 
zealously guarded her. She eluded his vigilance 
one day, came to the fort, and revealed the where, 
abouts of the celebrated outlaw. Kishkaukou was 
captured and lodged in Jail. The event created a 
great sensation. The captive became the lion of the 
day and was constantly visited by the curious, 
who had heard the marvelous tales told of this- 
notorious chief. There are several who still live, 
who remember the haughty warrior with his 
stately tread and his ferocious expression, his- 



Legends of Le Detroit. 241 

'hand always resting on his tomahawk. All were 
struck by the bold daring and almost insolent 
recklessness which pervaded his every movement. 
He was sentenced to be hung, the most degrading 
punishment possible to an Indian. 

It was the eve of his execution, November 21,, 
1822; Kishkaukou sat alone in his prison with the 
thought of the morrow as his companion. Death 
in itself had no terror for him, but the manner 
revolted against the traditions of his race ; how 
was his spirit to be freed from its mortal tenement 
if he were choked % Thus brooding over his fallen 
fortunes, the images of faded despotism passed 
before him, humiliation enveloped him like a 
pall, and his proud spirit was broken. He would 
become a by-word in his tribe, a scorn to his 
people. The door opened, disturbing his reflec- 
tions ; two of his squaws came in, followed by the 
jailer. Kishkaukou, as if by magic, suddenly 
dropped his mournful and dejected manner and 
conversed rapidly with them. As they left the 
jailer noticed one handing him a small tin cup, 
but thinking nothing of the occurrence let it pass. 
The next morning the squaws again returned to 
accompany their chief to his execution. The 
gallows was erected opposite the jail, where the 
First Presbyterian Church now stands. The jailer 
knocked at the door of the chief, but received no

answer ; he entered and found the warrior dead. 
Immediately the building resounded with the 
mournful wailing of the squaws who chanted the 
death song. How he killed himself was never 
definitely known, but it was strongly surmised 
that the cup given him by the squaw contained 
poison.* Thus the Chippewa chief's honor was 
saved and he left no legacy of disgrace to his 
tribe. 

* The poison given Kishkauliou by the squaw was probably the 
distilled juice from the roots of the wild citron plant. Its effects 
are peculiar. Almost immediately after swallowing it the victim 
has two or three convulsive shivers and then dies. The fruit of 
this plant is not poisonous ; it is used for preserving. 



A LEGEND OF L'ANSE CREUSE.* 



A woodpecker sat on an oaken stump, 

Pecking away with a ceaseless thump. 

And now and tlien, as he cocked his eye. 

Darted a glance so keen and sly. 

You'd have thought, had you seen him that summer day. 

Old Greenback has something queer to say. 

When that stump was a stately tree. 

Sturdy in trunk and sound in knee. 

Forward a little from the wood, 

Close by the edge of the bank it stood, 

And acorns dropped where the rijjples break 

Over the brim of the smiling lake. 

"When that tree was at its best, 

An emerald bird, with crimson crest, 

All through the summer, from dawn till dark. 

Hopped and tapped on its ridgy bark ; 

The limbs have dropped, the trunk is dead, 

But the plumes are shining on back and head, 

And the restless eye is clear and keen 

As when the old oak's leaves were green ; 

But under his throat, perhaps you'd say, 

Rubytop shows a spot of gray. 

Orchard and field for many a rood 

Cover the dust of the buried wood,

Just as the sun in his path on high 

Stayed his course in tlie middle sky. 

Speeding along with a foaming wake ' 

A great ship sailed upon the lake; 

And the loon dove down, and the white swans flew. 

Scared at the sight of the wonder new; 

For never had vessel along this shore 

Cleft these quiet waves before. 

No better craft was ever seen 

Than brave La Salle's stout brigantine : 

Out from the prow a GrifHn springs, 

Witji scales of bronze and tiery wings. 

And the ship that earned so wide a fame 

Bore on its scroll the Griflin's name. 

When the cunning Robes of Black 

Troubled the zealous Frontenac, 

And strove his venturous hands to keep 

From reaching out to the western deep. 

The wrath of the sturdy Norman rose 

At the jealous arts of his patron's foes. 

And the ship he built for his dangerous quest. 

He named from the valiant noble's crest. 

And vowed he would make the Griffin fly 

Over the crows in the western, sky. 

A glided eagle carved in wood 

On the crown of the quarter-deck castle stood. 

And from the staff astern unrolled, 

Floating aloft with its lilies of gold. 

The great white flag of France is spread. 

And the pennon decking the mainmast head 

Bears the chieftain's arms on a field of red. 

Three black-nebbed falcons gaping wide 

Scowl through the ports on either side. 

And the old sergeant says they speak.

Each for a common day in the week. 

While the great bow gun with its heavy linell 

Rings as loud as a Sunday bell. 

But another standard is seen to-day 

As the gallant cruiser wins the bay, 

For the cross is waved, and the censer swings, 

And the seamen kneel as the mass bell rings. 

For to-day is the feast of the Abbess Claii'e; 

And the corded priests, with cliants and prayer, 

Sprinldingthe lake with lioly water 

Name it after the Church's daughter. 

Then in a trice the gunners catch 

Each in his place the blazing match. 

And the flame leaps out, and the trembling shore 

Quakes at the terrible cannon's roar. 

And stout La Fleur with chuckling grin 

Said as he patted his culverin ‚Äî 

In my church there's never a friar 

Sings like the Abbot who leads the choir! 
******* 

Out in the lake the Griffin lay 
Wind-bound at anchor many a day. 
While the ship's company explore 
. The novel wonders of the shore; 
And as they reach upon I he way 
The bend at Pointe S, Guignolet, 
Before them spreads a lovely bay; 
Its limpid waters softly glide 
Like the slow creeping of the tide, 
Upward and backward on the beach. 
But ne'er beyond one margin reach. 
And in its lonely beauty there. 
So still, so smiling, and so fair. 
To their charmed eyes it seemed to be 
A sunny strip of Normand}', 
Where mermaids in the moonlight play, 
And happy children all the day. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 249 

Here, ‚Äî said La Salle, ‚Äî when history's page 
Inscribes us of an ancient age, ‚Äî 
When populous cities rich and great 
;See ships in fleets ascend the strait, ‚Äî 
When this new world shall lead the van. 
In the great onward march of man, ‚Äî 
Though men of olher blood may press 
More boldly through the wilderness. 
And though the flag of France may be 
Unknown upon this mimic sea, 
Tet, something whispers in my breast. 
Here shall be quietness and rest. 
Though commerce through the forest break, 
Or chum the waters of the lake. 
The Inland road shall not be nigh. 
The busy craft shall pass it by. 
And if our phantoms should be found 
Exploring then this pleasant ground, 
It still shall seem familiar earth. 
As the old region of our birth, 
Beside the shore a cross they plant. 
The reverend priests an anthem chant. 
And the stern soldier, as he went. 
To seek the shelter of his tent, 
Cast backward many a yearning look, 
Made homesick by that fairy nook. 
The ship sailed on, but the friendly shore 
Saw it returning nevermore. 
And many a day had come and fled 
And many a fall the leaves had shed. 
Before the eai'ly morning dews 
‚ñ† On the white clover by L'Anse Creuse 
Were dashed by footstep from their cup, 
Ere the dry sun had drunk them up. 
But when I grew to my chagrin 
A little baggy about the chin, 
^nd could not find suiBcient cause 



250 Legends of Le Detroit. 

For a wrinkle or two around my claws, 
The pleasing scene I daily viewed 
No longer was a solitude. 
Neat farms and gardens lined the strait 
From Erie up to Huron's gate, 
While on the narrow strips of laud 
The cottage homes so closely stand, 
Their numbers stretching up and down, 
Appear like one continuous town. 
In front of each upon the bank, 
A narrow wharf of single plank 
Stretched out to where a steady hand 
Might fill a bucket to the brim. 
Sinking it down below the rim. 
Yet never touch the bottom sand; 
While to this simple jetty tied 
Canoes float safely by its side. 

Whenever Monday's morning ray 
Brings to the world its washing day. 
The busy housewives and I heir daughters 
There with their labors vex the waters. 
The garments in their fingers gathered, 
With vigorous rubbing drenched and lathered,. 
And paddled with a cunning knack. 
Resound with many a rousing whack ; 
While the fair laundresses at work 
In no Carthusian silence lurk, 
But skilled alike to wash and speak, 
Go-ssip enough for all the week. 
In the small hamlet of L'Anse Creuse, 
One Monday, buzzed the stirring news 
That the old Seigneur of Beaiivais 
Was busy all the previous day. 
Devising how his daughter fair ‚Äî 
The arch and graceful Lady Claire ‚Äî 
' Might find ere long an honest mate. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 251 

Of gentle blood and good estate. 
Who by some valiant feat at arms 
Might pi-ove him worthy of her charms. 
He was a man whose antique blood. 
Traced backward to the very flood, 
Had with such notions filled his brain 
As once disturbed the knigh of Spain. 
He passed the vigor of his years 
Roving among his gallant peers. 
Exploring widely to advance 
The glory of his native France, 
And oft a pleasant hour had spent 
With gallant Tonty in his tent. 
Long years ago they made their way, ' 
And camped beside this smiling bay. 
To wait the gathering of the force 
Destined to guard the northern course. 
Then met the boldest hearts arrayed 
That ever pierced the forest shade. 
There met the venturous Beauvais, 
La Salle's stout warden La Forgt, 
And the sagacious Durantaye, 
Whose flag had waved o'er many a post 
On the remotest northern coast ; 
With his old comrade true and tried. 
Renowned Du Luth, who far and wide. 
Honest in heart, and strong in hand 
Swayed the fierce tribes through all the land. 
There, as they feasted at their ease 
Beneath the stately forest trees, 
With many a tale of savage fray 
They passed the pleasant hours away. 
And when the hallowed spot he knew, 
Once honored by the GriflBn's crew, 
Said bold Beauvais, this cross so tall 
Shall stand one day beside my hall, 
When age from labor shall release.

To let me dwell at home in peace. 
So, when he settled to retii'e, 
And light anew his household fire. 
He was the first who found his way 
To dwell .beside the cross and bay. 
He mingled reading and the care 
Of watching o'er his darling Claire, 
And soothed his fatherly alarms 
With chronicles of deeds of arms. 
As up she grew to womanhood. 
Merry and bright, as well as good, 
He dreamed of noble cavaliers 
Bearing her colors on their spears. 
And jousting on the meadows green 
To win the smile of Beauty's queen; 
And a great tournament he planned. 
The prize to be his daughter's hand. 
The damsel havmg mother wit. 
And some small will for using it. 
Had been enabled to discover 
She need not languish for a lover. 
And though she knew that young Beauclerc 
Was prompt enough to do or dare, 
She was not anxious for her sake. 
That he another's head should break, 
Nor would it suit her views at all 
Should others profil by his fall. 
So, with a smile upon her face. 
And many a blushing maiden grace, 
She met her honest father's question 
With a more practical suggestion. 
The Greek*:, in that heroic time 
Which all the poets call sublime. 
Instead of cai'ving up a friend. 
In public games did oft contend. 
And deemed a vegetable crown 
And name by Pindar handed down, ! 



Legends of Le Detroit. 253 

More likely to adorn the State 
Than if ihey earned a broken pate. 
When the hard winter's fi-ost shall make 
A slipp ry ice-field of the lake, 
No ancient circus could compete 
With such a course for flying feet; 
And if no youth my hand may claim 
But him who pleads a victor's name, 
Then let his honors be my price 
Who wins a race up(in the ice. 
The sire approved, and gave command 
To publish it througli all the land. 
That on the coming- Christmas day 
A horse race o'er the f I'ozen bay 
Should by its fair results decide 
What lucky hand should claim the bride 
Then to the shore in state he went. 
Where the good dames, on work intent,. 
Their weekly stoi'e of clothes did scrub 
In the great common washing tub; 
And sought their willing aid to bear 
His festive message through the air. 
Swiftly it traveled toward the south. 
Leaping from ready mouth to mouth; 
And while its echoes still did play 
In broken murmurs round the bay. 
Past Windmill Point, on pinions quick. 
It reached the mouth of Tremble's creeks 
And like a bullet from a gun 
Crossed the ravine at Bloody Run; 
Thence like the west wind on the main. 
Shook the great flag at Ponlchartrain; 
Then like a brightly falling star 
Gleamed on the household of Navarre, 
And shot along its flashing way 
Around the bend of Godfrey's bay. 
Startling the ghost that lingered still 



254 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Sighing in Grobeye's haunted mill. 

The violet banks of Bellefontaine 

And the cool shades of Lover's Lane 

Heard a low murmur, as of bees 

Humming among the linden trees. 

As up the Rouge the story sped, 

Old Va-de-bon-Cceur, as he shook his liead, 

Marveled that any other place 

Was chosen for a Christmas race; 

But cracking all his knuckles bony, 

Porthvt^ith began to train his pony. 

Beyond this region of the horse 

The message reached the broad Ecorce, 

Bousing the herdsmen as they roam 

O'er the wide acres of St. Cosrae. 

Across the channel to Grosse Isle, 

Shouted with sympathetic zeal, 

And thence beyond, the tidings go . 

To the rich island dark with shade 

By the gigantic lindens made. 

Within whose woods the Wyandot 

Had built his town in a charming spot. 

Guarding Lake Erie's open door; 

In the rough sailor pilot's lore 

'Tis known as the island of Bobalo. 

In the short passage of an hour. 

Sped by this tireless motive power, 

The news had entered at the gate 

Of every household on the strait. 

And the gay bachelors all prepare 

To struggle boldly for the fair; 

While pouting maidens ‚Äî half offended ‚Äî 

Wish that the day had come and ended, 

That they who fail to win the prize ‚ñ† 

Might find a better use of eyes; 

Yet none the less they toil and fluster 

To look their prettiest at the muster. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 255 

-And, sooth to say, the gallant wrong 
Would find his journey very long. 
Who traveled till he found the graces 
More prodigal of charming faces. 
The summer into autumn glides, 
The mellow autumn long abides, 
Till dark December claimed a part in 
The unruffled season of St. Martin; 
And many a lovely bosom fluttered, 
And many a savage youngster muttered. 
As the sun neared bis last decline. 
While winter yet had made no sign. 
But when the dreary solstice came. 
The morning sky was all aflame, 
And from the pblar deserts vast 
The wind came howling fierce and fast 
All day the clouds their snowflakes shed, 
The sighing waves were dark as lead, 
Sounding upon the gloomy shore 
Like the dull plash of melted ore. 
But in the night no vapor mars 
The lustre of the burping stars, ' 
High in the firmament the moon 
Shines dazzling as the sun at noon, 
And the cold beams the waves congeal 
Like a great floor of glimmering steel. 
All through the night from shore to shore 
The imprisoned waters moan and roar. 
But vain are all their throes t o break 
The dungeon walls that hold the lake. 
On Christmas eve the drowsy heads 
Went early to their downy beds. 
That all from sweet repose might borrow 
More blooming roses for the mo.rrow ; 
While even the watchful chanticleer 
Forgot to blow his clarion clear. 
And sitting snugly on his perch. 



256 Legends of Le Detroit. 

"Was silent as the village church. 
But when the rays of morning creep 
Down the gray spire of St. Philippe, 
And cast its shadows o'er the way 
Just at the foot of Grand Marais, 
The wooden cock that at its peak 
Stood opening wide its gilded beak, 
Thought surely there was something wrong- 
To make his brothers mute so long. 
Uprising on his sinewy toes. 
Far out his gorgeous breast he throws, 
While of the bracing air ho quaffed 
A deep exhilarating draught; 
Then from the bot'om of his throat 
He crowed so fierce a trumpet note 
That all the country stared aghast. 
Astounded by that sudden blast; 
And every rooster, roused to feel 
A rival worthy of his steel. 
Met the fierce chapel guardian's crow 
With a defiant coquerieo! 
Up from their beds the slumbering people- 
Sprang at that summons from the steeple,. 
And every bachelor and maid 
In rustic garments neat arrayed. 
With sparkling eyes and glowing face, 
Prepared to figure at the race. 
Too far from Fashion's halls to get 
The work of Ma'm'selle Tond-Minette,. 
The blooming damsels managed still 
To show the power of taste and skill. 
And when they all had met together, 
Rose tinted by the bracing weather. 
They made philosopher and dunce 
Fall swift in love with all at once. 

The mass was over, and the sleighs. 
Came sliding o'er the crystal ways. 



Legends of Le Detroit. 25^ 

As shining birds from flower to flower 
Dart swifily in tlie summer hour. 
The swan-neclied carioles make the scene 
Lively with scarlet, gold, and green, 
Tlie bright-eyed pacers, roan and bay. 
Caper like little boys at play. 
And toss their heads, as If tliey knew 
As much as human horses do. 
The lady Claire, with courteous mien 
Beams like a radiant fairy queen; 
But while she swiftly moved her eyes 
O'er the contestants for the prize, 
She turned a moment pale as snow, 
Then blushed with such a ruddy glow 
That all the maidens then and there 
Owned there was none so good and fair. 
And wished success to lovely Claire. 
For well, with ready wit, they guessed 
She had a purpose in her breast 
That none from her devoted swain 
The triumph of the course should gain; 
And each with sympathizing face 
Hoped that her own true lover's place 
Would be the second in the race. 
Then forth advancing in his tleigh 
The stately form of old Boauvais 
Appeared among the shouting throng. 
And with a voice like Stentor's strong, 
Taught by his daughter's shrewd device, 
"Who knew the mysteries of the ice. 
Announced the scrupulous rules to guide 
The contest for the peerless bride. 
In a straight run the course shall reach 
From where the trending of (he beach 
Rounds into Pointe a Guignolet, 
To Huron Point across the bay; 
Thence turning at the blasted elm,

The limit of Maconce's realm, 
Back to the starting point again 
Across the white and slippery plain. 
And he whose steed's returning feet 
Shall first upon the margin beat, 
Shall talie my mansion and my land, 
And, if she will, my daughter's hand. 

The graybeards shrugged their shoulders wide 

At such a long and freezing ride; 

Eight miles across the raven's flight 

Must reach before his feet can light; 

And when upon the glassy floor 

That space must twice be travelled o'er, 

The horse that wins without a founder 

Must be as hard as an eighteen pounder. 

But the swift pacers cocked their ears. 

In scorn at such unworthy fears; 

And, ranged in order on the shore. 

The friendly rivals reached a score, 

"Waiting tlie signal to begin 

The race that only one could win. 

Each in such sliding carviage placed 

As suits his money or his taste. 

-Jumper and cutter, train and pung 

Behind the nimble pony swung, 

"While the trim cariole's graceful wedge, 

"With its shafts hung low at the runner's edge, 

"Was decked in the spoils of the shaggy bear, 

Heady to cleave the frozen air. 

But what has troubled tlie Sieur Beauvais, 

And what the cause of the long delay ? 

The course is long and the day is brief, 

The night comes on like a stealthy thief. 

And woe to the wight who rides astray, 

Far from the land on the wintry bay. 

Alas, the old man's eyes are dim; j 

For under his features hard and grim 



Legends of Le Det/roit. 259 

His soul is soft and his spirit mild, 

And his heart is aching for his child; 

He knew her love for young Beauclerc, 

And marveled why he was not there. 

He was a youth of minly heart, 

Lithe as a panther, straight as a dart. 

And loved to share the hunter's toil 

More than he cared for his costly spoil. 

‚Ä¢Changing their names with one another. 

The Swan creek chieftain called him brother. 

And a sturdy man he saw who met 

The tawny or white Eshtonaquet. 

The chief just come from a prairie trail. 

Brought home a horse like a spotted quail. 

With long slim neck and Arab head. 

But a back that sloped like the roof of a shed. 

And legs that raised his ample chest 

Up to the height of an Indian's breast. 

And he gave a hint to young Beauclerc 

That none with this strange beast might cope, 

Though he should train an antelope. 

To run the race for his lady fair. 

He framed a jumper of ironwood tough. 

Limber and stout, but rude and rough. 

His harness strong and his reins to guide 

He made from thongs of bison hide, 

And there he sat with the jeering racers. 

Proud of themselves and their well groomed pacers. 

Wrapped in the shaggy robes of skin 

That his red brother clad him in; 

And many a scoff and scornful laugh 

‚Ä¢Greeted the sleigh with the brown giraffe. 

A whisper from the Lady Claire, 

And the old man with dubious air 

Shouted the signal. Off they fly, 

Skimming like swallows across the sky. 

But far behind, with drooping tail, 



260 Legends of Le Detroit. 

And swinging his legs like a clumsy flail, 

The prairie beast goes steadily on 

As if there were never a race to be won, 

While the neat ponies their sinews strain 

To reach the verge of the frozen plain. 

But when they turn at the blasted tree. 

Panting and foaming, lo, they see, 

Jogging along as fresh and stout 

As when from the s-hore they first set out, 

The clumsy brute whose movements seem 

Like the measured sweep of a walking-beam. 

And as the home-bound rivals ride 

Just in the midst of the basin wide, 

The shambling nag with his terrible stride 

Passes them all, and in'his eyes 

Gleams of a conscious triumph rise. 

Wider and wider he spreads apart 

His hoofs, and shoots like a fiery dart, 

Till his nimble limbs so swiftly fleet. 

He seems like a body without any feet 

Shot like a ball through the midst of the air, 

And he reaches the goal when there's nobody there;: 

For they thought it was safe to sit long by the fire, 

Not dreaming this monster, with sinews of^wire, 

And never within a decent stall, 

Would thus so horribly beat them all. 

But the boys when they saw the meek young men- 

Moodily driving back again. 

Shouted a mocking mange Vavoine! 

And the merry maids with smiling lip 

Welcomed them back from their leisure trip. 

But they looked more blithe when the lolly priest 

Asked them in to the wedding feast; 

And never since that Christmas-day 

Have the good dwellers by the bay 

Danced at the bridal of lady fair. 

Sweeter and brighter than lovely Claire. 




INTRODUCTION TO THE FRENCH EAMILIES. 



It is not the intention of the writer to give a detailed history of 
the French families, who first came to settle at Detroit, but to 
furnish such chronological data, as will be of value and interest 
to the descendants of this hardy Norman stock. 

In order to simplify the work, as a rule, the names have been 
selected of those, who are still perpetuated in the farms, streets 
or counties. In many cases their ancestral estates have passed 
into strangers' hands, whilst others have sought new homes and 
ties on the Canadian soil. Of the latter class are the families 
of Baby, Fillet, Groyeau, Parent, Montreuil, Marentette, Janis, 
Drouillard, Maisonville, La Butte, Jeanette and Berthelet, a name 
well and favorably known in Detroit, and still most prominent in 
Canada. 

At the time of the English Conquest in 1760, many English 
and Scotch came to cast their destinies with the fortunes of the 
struggling French colony. They were followed later by a number 
of Americans, who lent their talents, industry and enterprise 
towards rendering Detroit, the most beautiful and prosperous city 
of the West. A history of the French families would be incom- 
plete without even a brief mention of these noble pioneers: Cass, 
Sibley, Wocdbridge. Forsythe, Lamed, Brush, Visgar, Abbott, 
Audrain, Connor, Eberts, Knaggs, Leib, Hunt, Macomb, Wil- 
liams, McDougall, Sterling, McNiff, Meldrum, Parke, Schwartz, . 
Jones, Witherell, Palmer, Whiting, Eoberts, etc., etc.

STE. ANNE'S CHURCH. 



A history of Ste. Anne's Church woulrl be a history of the early 
Colony. To more graphic pens than mine I leave this task. Like 
a tender mother she gathered her children around her, she smiled 
in theii- joys and mourned in their sorrows, she placed the signet 
of heaven on the brow of the new born, she blessed the nuptial 
pair, and laid to sleep within her consecrated bosom the weary 
pilgrim. She kept a faithful record of the names and places of 
birth of all her children. Through tire, wars and Indian devas- 
tations slie was true to lier snored charge, and to-day many a claim 
to disputed property has been justly settled by her undeniable 
evidence. To the student of genealogy ihise old records with 
their musty yellow paper, blurred writing and odor of antiquity 
are most eloquent epitomes of the bievity of human life. Each 
generation like a wave of the sea rises, swells, then bursts on the 
shores of Eternity. One realizes the deep, profound truth hidden 
in the homely child rhyme of Solomon Grundy. The lullaby of 
the nursery only hides the De Profundis of the church. 

The first Ste. Anne's Church was built within the portals of old 
Fort Poutchartrain, and was called Ste. Anne's, from the fact 
that the first ma.ss celebrated therein was on the feast of that 
sainte (who was the molher of the Blessed Virgin), July 26, 1701. 
This church built by Cadillac was destroyed by the Indians, but 
rebuilt shortly afterwards in 1733. It occupied the ground on 
the north side of Ste. Anne's street (now Jefferson avenue), and 
stood opposite Joseph Campeau's homestead between Griswold 
and Shelby streets. It was then customary to bury within its 
walls the trustees. Roboit Navarre, Sr,, Royal Notary and Sub- 
Intendant, Pierre Chesne, Pierre Godfroy de Roquetaliade, Chev- 
alier Trotier des Ruissea\ix and Dr. Chnpoton were bulled there- 
in. The trustees also occupied a special pew, generally the tirst 
one on tlie right side of the aisle, near the altar. In 1805 the fire 
swept away the church. On the 4th of October, 1806, the Gov- 
ernor and Judges granted the petition presented by Father Richard 
for a deed to the ground to erect a new church. The following 
was the resolution passed: 

" Resolved, That the Roman Catholic Church be buili in the 
centre of the little military square on section No. 1 on the ground 
adjacent to the burying ground, the said lot fronting on East and 
West avenue (Michigan avenue) 200 feet wide and running back 
300 feet deep, and bounded on the three sides by three other 
streets." For a few years subsequent to the fire, the people at- 
tended service in the Meldrum storehouse near the river, between 
Randolph and Bates streets, from thence Father Richard removed 
to Springwells, where mass was said in a house on the Laselle 
farm. The records of Ste, Anne's have been faithfully kept from 
1701, when the first baptism administered in the colony was to

TherSse, daughter of La Mothe Cadillac. To show the care 
manifested in preparing these early records, below an instance is 
^iven (translation). 

" The undersigned Recollgt Priest exercising vicarial functions 
at Fort Pontchartrain of Detroit, declares that the present book 
contains 13 sheets of paper, being the veritable first book or regis- 
try of baptisms and interments at Fort Pontchartrain, and that it 
lias been prepared and arranged by tlie venerable PSre Dominique 
‚Ä¢de la Marclie, formerly Professor of Theology and RccoUgt Priest, 
my predecessor at this same mission of Fort Pontcharti-ain, and 
for the purpose of giving to this registry all necessary force and 
value, I have requested Monsieur Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, 
‚ñ†commandant for the king at said fort, to honor it with his signa- 
ture. 

Done at said place the 15lh of January, 1709. 

Pkbee Chbrdbin Deniatj. 

Recoliet Miss. Priest." 

"We, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, Lord of the places of 
Douaguet and Mont Desert, Commander for the king at Fort 
Pontchartrain, certify that the present book contains 13 sheets, 
being the faithful registry of baptisms and interments. In faith 
"Of which we have signed. 

Done at said fort, Januaiy 16th, 1709. 

(Signed) La Mothe Cadillac." 

The signatures attached to the different entries show tliat the 
‚ñ†officers and many of the colonists were familiar with the pen. 
The spirit of caste is apparent in the designation of titles and 
-various employments. A glance at the signatures at the end of a 
marriage entry, at once gives a clue to the social position of the 
‚Ä¢contracting parties. The officers, both civil and military, belonged 
to the old regime and many of them bore names which stood high 
among the noblesse of France. Louis XIV, anxious to promote 
the interests of his colonies, offered every inducement in the shape 
of grants of land and bounties, to emigrants from France. By 
younger sons of the nobility, by those whose fortunes had been 
mined, and by the adventurous, these opportunities were readily 
seized. Whilst the feudal system was dying out in France, the 
king revived it in the colony of Canada, by granting to his offi- 
-cers, distinguished soldiers and prominent colonists, so-called 
seigneuries (a domain of half a league front and two or three 
leagues deep), mostly situated on the St. Lawrence and its trib- 
utaries. Outside the grants to Cadillac, there were no seigneuries 
granted on the Detroit or along the lakes, save the one to the 
‚Ä¢jChevalier Le Gardeur de Repentigny, at Saulte Ste. Marie, but in.

place, were the grants of land, at present called farms, and which 
were originally only given to prominent colonists. Tlie younger 
scions of 'French noblesse could enter into trade in these colonies 
without derogating from their rank, and at once opened an im- 
mense trade in beaver, mink and other furs with the Indians. A 
merchant then, was a man requiring considerable wealtli, for 
every article of use was brought from Quebec or Montreal by 
canoe, which was dangerous and perilous with tedious portages. 
The officers who came here were generally accompanied by their 
wives and some of their connections. Somatimes the love of 
admiration was greater than tliat of conjugal affection, as in the- 
case of the beautiful Angelique des Meloises, the wife of Hugues 
Pean, who found Quebec and the society of Intendant Bigot, too 
interesting to accompany lier husband to the uncivilized wilds of 
his new post. The Campeaus, Cuillerier de Beaubien, Trotier- 
des Ruisseaux. Chesne St. Onge. Godefroy de Roquetaliade, and 
Godefroy de Marboeuf, Barthe, Cicotte and Gode de Marentette 
accompanied some of the officers to whom they were related. 
De Mersac, Chapoton, Reaume, Cliabert de Joncaire and Mouet 
de Moras came as officers. The Morand Grimard, Des Comptes- 
Labadie. De Quindre came between 1745 and tlie English con- 
quest. The Macombs, Anthons, McDougalls, Riopelles and many 
others came in with the English conquest of Canada, in 1760. 

The titles were dropped from the record entries, also the gen- 
eral designation of employment, place of residence and profes- 
sion, in 1760. It was with the early French customary to confer 
soubriquets or nicknames. These were either derived from the 
province, city or village from whence the individual came, viz. : 
Casse dit St. Aubin Gauchois (de Gaux), Provensal (de Provence); 
from some agricultural source, such as: L'oignon (onion), La. 
Tulippe (tulip). La Prune (plum); from some marked peculiarity: 
Grosse Jarabe (big leg), Momirelle (mummy); others from the 
estates, viz. : De Beaubien, de Bondy ; De Quindre, de Marentette. 
A child born on a festival was pretty sure of perpetuating the. 
event in his name, viz.: Noel, Pasques, Toussaint. Assumption. 
This custom prevails to some extent to the present day, among 
their descendants. 

P. 8. ‚Äî Carignan Regiment. In 1664. Louis XIV sent tO' 
Canada, the famous Regiment de Carignan commanded by Col. 
de SalliSres. It was a famous body of troops, and had distin- 
guished itself fighting against the Turks. It was consolidated 
witli that of SalliSr named in honor of the Colonel of the Carig- 
nan, Tiiey were officered by fifty or sixty French gentlemen 
belonging to the noblesse. Many of them obtained concessions 
of land, settled upon them and became the ancestors of many of 
the French families of to-day. 



Early French Families. 267 

Some of these families have thus, in the course of two hundred 
years lost their original names and are either known by their title 
or soubriquet or their names have been changed into the English 
equivalents. 

The older officers who came with La Mothe or were stationed 
at the po¬´t at different times, are usually designated in the records 
as having belonged to the Oarignan Sal litres regiment or to a " De- 
tachment of Marines." They were not marines in the present 
acceptance of the term, but troops sent out from France under 
tlie auspices of the naval department, and responsible to that 
authority alone. 

Many think that the French Canadian spoke only a patois for- 
getting that at the period when these pioneers came, French litera- 
ture wiis in its zenith. Being a conservative people, they preserved 
not only the manners and customs of the mother countiy, but the 
purity of its language, a fact illustrated by a request made recently 
by certain French writers for the simple old Norman songs, which 
the French Canadian alone retained in all their original purity. 
Many words which are considered patois, may be found in the 
works of Racine, Corneille, or Boileau. The language of France 
like the human body is constantly undergoing a change. A 
Parisian four years absent from Paris is liable to l3e detected when, 
he writes. One is reminded of the fish woman of Athens who 
knew by a new customer's accent that he belonged to the suburb* 
of the city. 

Almost all the old families possessed slaves as servants; they 
were called " Pani&gt;i," (pronounced Pawnees). Very few were of 
African origin, mostly Indians, belonging to remote tribes who 
had been made prisoners by the Ottawas or Iroquois. They were 
sold to the whites, in some instances given as presents by a chief 
who wished to secure the good offices of the pale-face. They 
made exceptionally good servants, and were much attached to- 
their masters. The records of Ste. Anne's have faithfully chron- 
icled their births, marriages ‚ñ†and deaths.

This )-emarkable man was born at Saintes, France, October 15, 
1764. He was educated at the College of Angers, and studied for 
the ministry at the Theological Seminary of Paris. During the 
Revolution, he left France, came to America and was appointed 
Pi-ofe.vsor of Mathematics in St. Maiy's College, Md. He was a 
missionary to the Indians for six years. In 1798 he came to De- 
troit and biuit the present Ste. Anne's Church. He was a man 
‚ñ†of wonderful erudition; he spoke and wrote in seven different 
languages. So anxious was he to establish schools for the educa- 
tion of his flock that he sent to France for teachers. The first 
printing-press in the Northwest was brought to Detroit by him. 
All the laws of the Territory and the printed matter then required 
was done under his immediate supervision. He published the 
Micliigaa Bsmy, a French newspaper, wliicli was later discon- 
tinued. Many an old French famijy to-day possess prayef-book.s 
and other religious works publislied by this pioneer press. He 
took an active interest in everything appertaining to the growth 
and advancement of the Territory. 

In 1833 he was elected delegate to Congress, where his success- 
ful efforts for the good of the Territory earned him the grateful 
appreciation of every enterprising citizen. His acquaintance was 
eagerly sought by Catholic and Protestant. There were no fire 
engines, nor well-regulated fire departments in those days. At 
the first alarm all able-bodied citizens ranged themselves in two 
lines from the river to the burning pile, the leather buckets (which 
always hung in the front hiiU) were passed up one line, the empty 
ones down tlie opposite one. Father Richard always took his 
place with the rest. During the cholera he was indefatigable in 
attendance on the sick and dying. Two long months of inces-, 
sant labor among the most harrowing scenes, told heavily on a 
constitution already impaired by great austerities and over-work. 
Yet the weary, worn, faithful guardsman of Calvary only left 
his post when disease placed its fatal impress upon him. Kven 
tlien, mindful of his flock, he consoled them by promising that 
his death " would close the door on the cholera." The prediction 
was verified; his was the last case. Two thousand mourners 
followed his remains to their last resting place, the sublime char- 
acter of the man conquering nature's selfish fear of contagion. 
For forty-three years he was intimately identified with the City 
‚Ä¢of the Straits. In the history of Detroit Gabriel Richard will

ADHEMAE DE ST. MARTIN. 



' To this family belong a brancli of Navarre, Gode de Maren- 
tette, the Anthons of New York, the Scotch brancli of Mcintosh. 
Antoine Adhemar de St. Martin was appointed a Royal Notary 
at Quebec as early as 1660. He was tlie son of Michel and Cecile 
Gache, de St. Salvy, Haul Languodoc. He married twice. His- 
descendants bv his first wife are still in Canada. By his second, 
Michelle Cusson. whom he married in 1687, lie had one son, Jean 
Bapte, born in 1689, who in 1709, came to Detroit, and married 
there Marie Louise Dogon, by whom he had five children: 1. Jo- 
seph married 1757 Madeleine Peuillet; he died in 1778; 3. Jac- 
ques' surnamed La Butte, married 1760, Marianne Navarre,

daughter of Robert, the Sub-Intendant; 3. Francois; 4. Mar- 
guerite, married 1758, Col. Louis Jadot. She is the aucestress 
of the Anthons of New York; 5. Marie Louise, married 1760, 
Jacques Gode de Marentette. 

Jacques de St. Martm, frequently culled La Butte, was a noted 
interpreter. He was a brotherin law of Lieut. Geo. McDougall, 
whom he accompanied with Major Campbell to Pontiac's camp 
at that chief's suggestion that he wished to treat with them. (Tlie 
office of interpreter was a very important one, and the English 
suffered much owing to the rascality of some of these men. Tlie 
French missionaries and French officers were mostly all familiar 
with the Indian languages and were seldom imposed upon. Brad- 
street and Sir William Johnson complained of their interpreters, 
but always made honorable exceptions of Cliabert de Joncaire, 
Chesne La Butte, later of Henry Connor and Whittmore Knaggs.) 
He married Marianne Navarre, who after his death in 1768, mar- 
ried Dr. George Christian Anthon. She died at the age of thirty- 
six, leaving no heirs by Anthon, but tliree by St. Martin. They 
resided in the old Cass House which belonged to St. Martin. 1. 
St. Martin St. Martin, died in early manhood, unmarried; 3. 
Finon. married Philip Fiy; 3. Archange, born 1766, married 
Angus Mcintosh, who inherited the estates which belonged to the 
Earldom of Moy, the Earldom itself having been forfeited in the 
rebellion against the House of Hanover. He was noted for his lav- 
ish hospitality. The sons of this marriage returned to Scotland. 
Two of the daughters were well known in Detroit, Mrs. Henry 
J. Hunt, and Miss Kittie Mcintosh who died a few years ago. 

ANTHOSr BRANCH. 

Marguerite de St. Martin married, 1758, Col. Louis Jadot, an 
officer in de Muy's regiment. He was the eldest son of Jacques 
Jadot, former Mayor and Alderman of Rocrois (Fi-ance), and 
Marie Boland. Col. Jadot was killed in 1765 by the Indians, his 
wife had died in 1764 leaving an infant daughter, Geneviive, to 
the care of her brother J.-icques and his wife Marianne Navarre. 
Little Genevieve was kindly taken care of by her aunt Mai'ianne, 
who becoming a widow married Dr. Anthon. In 1773 Mrs. An- 
thon died, and Genevieve was left with her cousins, the St. Maitin 
children, as the wards of Dr. Anthon and their uncle, Alexander 
Macomb. When Genevieve reached her fifteenth year Dr. An- 
thon married lier; he was at the time forty-five. 

A brief sketch of the doctor whose life was an adventtu'ous 
one and who gave to America its most celebrated classical scholar, 
Charles Anthon, may be interesting to many. Dr. Geo. Christian 
Anthon, born at Salzugen in 1734, died in New Tork in 1815. He 
studied medicine in his nativ ‚Ä¢ place, afterwards at Gerstungen. 
In 1750 he passed his examination before the medical authorities

‚ñ†of Eisentach. From thence in 1754 he went to Amsterdam, 
passed two examinations there before the College of Surgeons, and 
was appointed surgeon in the Dutch West India trade. He made 
several voyages but the vessel he was on was captured in 1757 by 
a British privateer from ]New York, and was carried into that 
port. At theage of twenty-three, he found himself in a new and 
strange country without friends and with no other resources than 
his profession. Confident of his ability he applied for a position 
in the military hospital at Albany. His talents were recognized 
and he was appointed First Assistant Surgeon in the First Battal- 
lion. Sixtieth Regiment, Royal Americans. In 1760, lie was de- 
tached witli the party wliich under Major Rogers took possession 
of Detroit. He married twice: 1st, Marianne Navarre, the widow 
of Jacques de St. Martin, by whom he had no heirs; in 1778 Gen- 
evifeve Jadot, her orphan niece on tlie St. Martin side. In 1786 Dr. 
Anthon removed witli his family to New York, journeying thither 
by way of Montreal. Three of flie doctor's children were born 
in Detroit. George, born 1781, died N. Y., 1865; John,* born 
1784, died N. Y., 1863; Dorothea Louisa, born 1786, died N. Y.,

BABY. 



This family, strictly speaking, after the English Conquest be- 
came and remained English subjects. One of its illustrious 
branches was born in Detroit, and a few of its descendants still 
reside in the State. The founder was Jacques Baby de Rainville, 
son of Jean, Seigneur de Rainville, and Isabeau Robin, of Guienne, 
France. Jacques was an officer in the famous Carignan Regi- 
ment, and thus came to America. He married, in 1670, Jehanne 
Dandonneau du Sablee. Their children were: 

Marie Jeanne, born 1671, married 1689, Paul de Lusignan, and 
in' 1700, Claude Pauperet. 

Jacques, born 1673, married 1709, Madeline Vevon de Grand-

Jacques Dup&amp;ron Baby settled at Detroit. His name is inti- 
mately woven in the history of the seige of Pontiac, in 1760. He 
was a man of great worth and integrity, gaining alike the respect 
and contidence of the French, English and Indians. He married 
in 1760, Susanne Reaume, daughter of Pierre and Susanne Hu- 
bert de la Croix. Jacques died in 1796, leaving eleven children 
to bless his name and to emulate his good example. Of the .girls, 
one married Mr. Caldwell, one Mr. Allison, another Ross Lerin, 
and the fourth Mr. Bellingham, afterwards Lord Bellingham. 
Three of the sons becam.e officers in the British army, and by 
their bravery won renown and high positions. They were Daniel, 
Antoine and Louis. Pierre studied medicine at Edinburg, Scot- 
land. He returned to Canada and married a lady of Scotch 
extraction. 

Jacques, the eldest of Jacques Dupfiron and Susanne Reaume, 
after completing his studies at the Seminary of Quebec, went ta 
Europe to perfect himself in certain branches. He married Eliza 
Abbot, by whom he had five boys and one girl: 

Jacques became a lawyer, and died in Toronto; he had married 
the daughter of an English officer.

I. Marie Archange, born 1749. Dr. Chapoton, of the French 
army, was her godfather. She married John Askin, Governor 
of Michillimackinac. The Askins are of Scotch origin and trace

later to Port Pontchartrain, and was associated with him in his 
extensive trade at Mackinaw and with the Miamis. In 1760 
Pierre married Charlotte Chapoton, daughter of Dr. Jean Cliap- 
oton, surgeon in the French army. Their daughter, Char- 
lotte, b. 1763, was the only survivor of four children. She 
married, in 1780, Lt. Louis Reaume, of the British army, who 
left her a young widow within the year. In 1784 she became the 
second wife of Antoine Louis Descomptes Labadie, surnamed 
"Badichon," and became the grandmother of Mrs. R. 8. Willis, 
Mrs. Giesse, Mrs. Alexander Chapoton, Sr., the LagrSves, of St. 
Louis, Mo. 

Commodore Alexander Grant married, in 1774, Therfese, daugh- 
ter of Charles Barthe, and Marie TherSse Campeau, was of the 
clan of Grants of Glenmoriston, Scotland. He entered the navy 
at an early age, but resigned in 1757 to join a Highland regiment 
raised for the army of General Amherst in America. In 1759 he . 
reached Lake Ohamplain. Gen. Amherst desiring able officers 
for his fleet on the lake, commissioned Lieut. Grant to the com- 
mand of a sloop of sixteen guns. After the conquest of Canada, 
Grant was ordered to Lakes Erie and Ontario. Detroit was then 
an English garrison, and it was here he met his fate in Therese 
Barthe. He built his castle as it was called at Grosse Pointe. (Its 
site is at present occupied by Mr. T. P. Hall's summer residence, 
"Tonnancour.") It was a noted place for the courtesy of its 
host and his open, generous hospitality. Tecumseh and his 
warriors were frequent guests at the Grant castle. The Commo- 
dore belonged to the executive council in 1805 of Upper Canada. 
In a letter to his brother Alpine, dated from York (Toronto), July 
5, 1811, he says: " My duty where my naval command requires 
me is such a distance from here that I cannot travel in the winter 
when the Legislature meets, but I come down at my ease in the

has served his country upwards of fifty-five years requires some

commanding presence, a great favorite and , a good officer. He 
had ten daughters, who are to-day represented by the English- 
Canadian families of Wrights, Robinsons, Dicksons, Woods, 
Duffs, Gilkersons, Millers, JacolDs and Richardsons. Mr. Jasper 
Gilkerson, of Brantford, whom the author had the pleasure of 
meeting, has been in charge of the Indians in Canada for many 
years. So faithful has he been to his charge, that any promise 
made to the Indians by him has always been kept by the govern- 
ment. A worthy representative of his grandfather. Commodore 
Grant, who when administrator, with the power of giving free 
grants of land, never granted any to his family or their connec- 
tions. . Commodore Grant died at Grosse Poiute in 1813. 

BEATJFAIT. 



In 1796, Sergeant Winthrop, Acting Governor of the North West 
Territory, formed the new County of Wayne. Its boundaries ex- 
tended from the Cayuga river on the west, to the dividing line now 
existing between Indiana and Illinois, on the north to the national 
boundary line, including all of the subsequent territory of Michi- 
gan, and a portion of Ohio and Indiana. The Courts of Com- 
mon Pleas for Wayne county were organized, and the Judges 
chosen to preside over them were business men, upright, honest, 
and intelligent. Louis Beaufait was the first Senior Justice. He 
came directly from France, was the son of Luc and Gabrielle 
Sourceau, parish of St. Martin, diocese de la Rochelle. In 1766 he 
married Therfese de Mersac, d. of Francois, and TherSse Campeau. 
Their children were : Thomas, b. 1768 ; Makib Ikbnb, b. 1770, 
married Jean Bapte Rivard, son. of J. Bapte and Catherine Hiax; 
Louis, b. 1773, afterwards Col. Beaufait. He lived , on the old 
Beaufait farm, (to-day known as the Bagg). There the cele- 
brated Chippewa warrior Kishkaukou came to encamp after the 
murder of Judge Rielly's clerk. He was made a prisoner and 
would have paid the penalty of his crime on the gallows, had he 
not poisoned himself on the eve of the execution. He married, 
1804, Louise Saussier. A son of Col. Beaufait, Louis, married, 
1835, Catherine Peltier, daughter of Charles and Martha Cecile

were its branches that there is scarcely now a family of French 
descent in Detroit, which does not claim a Campeau among its 
ancestors. The first of the name who came to Canada was:

1760, Catherine Menard. He was one of the 1st Captains of Militia, 
and his services are frequently mentioned, with high praise in 
the early annals of Detroit. There is a tradition that Jacques' 
grandfather was La Mothe Cadillac's Secretary for a while. If 
handwriting were any recommendation, Cadillac's choice was a 
fortunate one, for, as a family, their chirography is peculiarly 
noticeable for its beauty and distinctness. Jacques possessed much 
property, which is still in the family, and with the rapid growth 
of the city, has become immensely valuable. In 1784 he mar. 
Francoise Navarre, d. of the Sub-Intendant, and the widow of 
the gallant officer, George McDougall. By his second wife he 
had no heirs, but by his first, several ; among others the following

ette, mar. Sophie de Mersac. 

Joseph, b. Feb. 25, 1769, died in 1860, was for many years one of 
the central figures in the history of Detroit. He inherited some of 
his property, but by untiring industrj^, careful management, aided 
by the rapid increase and prosperity of the city encircling him on 
all sides, he was able to leave to his heirs one of the most valuable 
estates in the North West. He mar,, in 1808, Adelaide, d. of 
Antoine Daigneaux Douville De Quindre and Catherine des 
Riviferes de la MorandiSre. He had a large family, viz. : I.Joseph, 
died unmarried. 

2. Daniel, mar. Marie Palms, d. of Ange Palms, of Antwerp, 
and Jeanette Catherine Pesters. Ange had been Quarter- 
master of one of the divisions of Napoleon's Army, at Water- 
loo. By his successful efforts to save the ammunition at that 
disastrous battle, he was made by Napoleon, on the field, a 
Chevalier de la Legion d'Honor. During the stormy period of 
the dethronement of Charles X., and the elevation of Louis 
Phillippe, the Citizen King, Mr. Palms was obliged to leave 
Belgium. He remained two years at Mayence, in Germany. He 
was an ardent admirer of Chateaulriand, , and his description of 
America, with its grand primeval forests, its wonderful Niagara, 
roused his desire to travel through the country which had won 
such enthusiastic praise from France's most gifted son. Mr. 
Palms brought letters of introduction from his intimate and per- 
sonal friend, the Prince de Liege, Archbishop of Malines, to 
Bishop Dubois, of New Orleans, La. , also a letter to President- 
Van Buren, who introduced the Belgian exile to New York's 
most cultured society, to the Van Ransselars, Minturns, Roose- 
velts, etc. , where he was a wqlcome guest. On his travels he had 
proceeded as far as Detroit, where, Aug.' 26, 1833, his wife died 
of cholera. Thus a new land became her tomb, and the cradle 
of the race on American soil. He abandoned all thought of 
returning to Belgium, for he had given to America his most 
sacred deposit. Ange Palms' parents were: Francois and Marie 
Rosenboeck, Jeanette Peeters his wife's parents were: Pierre and 
Jeanne Catherine Tumen, of Malines, Belgium. Ange had several 
brothers and sisters: 1. Francois, a distinguished priest, noted 
for his scholarly attainments; 2. Franpoise; 3. Jerome, a wealthy 
banker of Antwerp ; 4. Baptiste; 5. Marie Anne, mar. William Van 
Dick; 6. Elise, mar. Mr. Calhouy. Ange's children settled in Detroit

union.

Angeliq,ue married 1886, Jean B. Piquette, son of Jean Bapte 
and Eleonore Descoraptes Labadie. The Piquette family was orig- 
inally from Picardie, and the name is frequently seen in the 
"Amorial General of France." The first in this country was Eus- 
tache, who married in 1680, Jeanne Boucher. His son Joseph 
married 1706, Marie Therfese Merienne, daughter of Jean Meri- 
enne de Lasolavye, who was godfather in 1685 for Marienne,

Gaudry. Joseph, born 1753, married 1776, Marguerite Renaud. 
Jean Bapte married 1808, Eleonore Descomptes Labadie. To 
this family belongs the celebrated Sulpioian Francois Picquet, 
who, in order to attach the Iroquois confederacy to the French, 
founded a mission at the mouth of the Oswegatchie in 1748. He 
erected a substantial stone building and placed this inscription on 
the cornel' stone. ''Francois Picquet laid the foundation of this 
building in the name of the Almighty God, in 1749." This 
inscribed corner stone occupies a conspicuous position in the State 
Armory, erected at Ogdensburg in 1858.

CHABEET DE JONCAIRE. 



This name figures conspicuously in the annals of Detroit, espe- 
cially from the time of the English conquest. In France it is still 
found among the nobility, in the navy, and on the tablets of the 
French Academy. Thomas was a nobleman, came to Canada as 
an officer, having an aptitude for languages, he soon mastered the 
Indian dialects and became royal interpreter for the five nations. 
He married at Montreal, Marguerite LeGuay of Rouen. Their 
son Daniel, born 1714, was a Lieutenant in the French army, and 
later succeeded to his father's position of interpreter. He married 
in 1751, Ursule Marguerite Elizabeth de la MorandiSre, of the 
distiguished Rocbert family of Canada. He died at Detroit, in 
1770, three years later he was followed to the grave by his wife, 
leaving several children, among whom were : 1. Louis ; 3. 
Philippb, married 1783, Judith Gouin, daughter of Claude 
Thomas and Josette Cuillerier de Beaubien; 3. Angeliqub 
Marguerite, named from her godmother Angelique Cicotte, wife 
of Medor Gamelin. Philippe at the baptism of his daughter 
Judith, signs himself Chevalier. Francois Chabert de Joncaire, 
was a nephew of Daniel, son of Gabriel, Captain of Infantry, and 
Marguerite Fleury de la Gorgendifere, one of the most aristocratic 
and powerful families of Canada. The Chevalier was a man of 
great ability and took an active interest in promoting the growth 
of the city of Detroit. He, with Solomon Sibley and Jacob Vis- 
gar, represented Wayne county in the Legislative Assembly of the 
North West Territory, held at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1799, at which 
General William Harrison was chosen delegate to Congress. In 
1780, the Chevalier married Josette Chesne, by whom he had 
several children, to-day represented by a branch of the Loranger

CHESNE. 

As early as 1717 the name of Chesne appears on the records of 
Ste. Anne's, and one is attracted by the beautiful and picturesque 
signature. So clear, precise, full of character and individuality. 
Pierre, the founder of the race ou the soil of the New World, 
married, in 1676, at Montreal, Jeanne Bailly, of a family of con- 
siderable importance. Two of his sous, Charles and Pierre, came 
to Detroit as early as 1717, and are the ancestors of that name in 
Michigan. They were active and enterprising and at once took 
leading positions in the colony. CHARiiES married, in 1733, 
Catherine Sauvage; Pierre married, 1738, Madeleine Boy, in 
1786, Louise Lothman de Barrois, a sister of Marie Lothman, 
wife of Robert Navarre, the Sublntendant. Pierre was called 
La Butte, though St. Onge was the proper title. Many of his 
descendants are only known under the name of La Butte. He 
was interpreter for a number of years, and fulfilled his office 
most satisfactorily. He had many children. All died unmarried 
save Pierre Toussaint, who continued this branch. Pierre, 
Sr., died in 1774. Agathe married Wm. Sterling. Charles 
and Catherine Sauvage had ten children: 1. Catherine, b. 1733,

Isidore, b. 1737, married 1758, TherSse Bequet; 8. Antoine, b. 
1743. Isidore was noted for liis great bravery, and figures con- 
spicuously in the military annals. To him was deeded a tract of 
land by the Pottawatomie at the same time as the one to Robishe 
Navarre. The grant to Isidore was confirmed by Lieut. Gov. 
Hamilton in 1777. He married Therfese Bequet. In 1780 his 
daughter Josette married the Chevalier Francois Chabert de 
Joncaire. Charles, son of Charles and Catherine Sauvage, mar-

CICOTTE. 



Cicot or Chiquot as it was sometimes written, is found in the 
early pages of the registry of Fort Ponchartrain. The founder of 
this family in America was Jean, born 1681, son of Guillaume 
and Jeanne Farfart, de Bolu, Diocese of Rochelle. He married at 
Montreal 1663, Marguerite Maclin ; the children were : Catherine, 
born 1663; Jean born 1666. Catherine married 16 79, Joseph Huet of 
Boucherville, whose mother a Jacquelien, belonged to the family of 
the celebrated de la Rochejacquelien the Vendean chief. The 
Amblers, Jacqueliens and other Virginia families claim descent 
from the Huguenot branch which passed into England, thence to 
Virginia. 

Jean married 1679, Catherine Lamourieux ; Zacharie their son 
born in 1708, married in 1736 Angelique Godefroy de Marboeuf.

He had come to Fort Pontchartrain in 1730 as a merchant. The 
quantity of handsome plate possessed by this family has fre- 
quently been mentioned; with the exception of Miss St. Martin, 
(afterwards the wife of Angus Mcintosh) there was no such com- 
plete collection of silver in the colony. The fate of war, pillage 
by the Indians, extravagant living and reckless trust in the honor 
of others, soon scattered this superb property. Some few rem- 
nants are still in the possession of the descendants. Zacharie's 
children were: 1. Angelique, born 1741; 3. Catherine, born 1744; 
3. Zacharie, born 1746; 4. Jean Baptiste, born 1749, married 1770,' 
Angelique Poupart Lavoise, whose marriage contract is given 
below; it is dated 1770. By the Treaty of Paris the French in- 
habitants preserved some of their privileges, rights and ancient 
customs. It is selon les " Contumes de Paris." 

Jkan Bapte had fifteen children, thirteen of whom lived to 
maturity. They resided upon the Cicotte farm, the present Peter 
Godefroy farm, which was confirmed to Angelique Cicotte (Jean 
Bapte's widow) by the TJ. S. Commissioners in 1819. The chil- 
dren were: 

Angelique, born 1771, married 1787, Medor Gamelin, son of 
Ignace and Louise Dufros de la Jemerais, nephew of Madame 
D'Youville, foundress of Les Soeurs Crises (Grey Nuns), of Mon- 
treal, whose life has been so charmingly written by L'Abbe Faillon. 
Agathe, born 1773, married 1790, Jacob Visgar, one of the 
representatives with Solomon Sibley, and the Chevalier Chabert 
de Joncaire in the Legislative assembly at Cincinnati in 1799, to 
elect Gen. (afterwards president) Harrison, a delegate to Congress. 
The children were: Joseph, married Mile. Godefroy, daughter of 
Col. Gabriel Godefroy; Catherine, married 1819, Whittmobe 
Knaggs, son of William and Josette Descomptes Labadie, a

born 1775; Joseph, married 1835, Susanne Drouillard. 

Francois X., born 1787, married 1819, Felice Peletier, the 
widow of Capt. Peter Tallman, an artillery officer in the TJ. S. A. 
Francois was commissioned as a captain by Gen. Hull in 1813. 
His small company, mostly composed of men inured to the toils, 
dangers and privations of frontier life, were noted for their disci- 
pline and undaunted bravery. After the defeat of Winchester at 
Mpnroe, an Indian chief brought a Dr. Brown, a Kentuckian, to 



286 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Mr. Francois Cicotte to sell as his prize. The Indian wanted $100 
for the ransom of his captive, which was paid to him. Dr. 
Brown afterwards visited his deliverer when he came again to 
Detroit with Gen. Harrison's army. Francois died in 1860. He 
was a fine specimen of the early Frenchman, possessing that rare 
charm of manner which seemed a peculiar legacy to these descend- 
ants of the first pioneers. His children are well known in Detroit. 

1. Edward, for many years occupying many positions of pub- 
lic trust, married 1st, Miss Bell of New York, t)y whom he had 
one son, Geokgb; married second time Lucretia Abbott, daughter

With regard to tha division of property in general according to 
the civil law of Canada, it consisted of movable and immovable 
property. 

Movable was anything that could be moved without fraction. 

Immovable was anything that could not be moved, and was 
divided into two kinds, propres (personal), and acquitls (acquired). 
Proprea (personal), is an estate inherited by succession in the direct 
or collateral line, and Acquit is an estate or property that is ac- 
quired by any other means. 

CoMMUNtTY op PROPERTY, was the partnership of husband and 
wife contract on marrying; but they could stipulate in their mar- 
riage contract that there should be no community of property be- 
tween them. 

The dot or dowry was all the property which the wife put into 
the community whether movable or immovable. But immovable 
property falling to her in a direct or collateral line is a proper or 
personal estate to her; and does not fall into the community. The 
dower was a certain right given by law or by particular agreement 
to the wife; it was of two kinds, the customary Dower, and the 
stipulated Dower. The former consisted of half the property which 
the husband was possessed of at the time of their marriage and 



Early French Families. 289" 

half of all the property which might come to him in a direct Ime: 
The stipulated dower was a certain sum of money or portion of 
property, instead of the customary dower during her lifetime ; a t 
her death it fell to her childi'en who did not accept the succession 
of their father, but her heirs succeed to the stipulated dower. 
Hence by the community which existed in marriage, no man could 
dispose of any or part of his property without the consent of his^ 
wife. 

CTJILLEEIER DB BBAUBIEN. 



This family still stands among the most distinguished in Canada. 
It is known under the names of Trotier de Beaubien, des RiviSres 
Trotier des Ruisseaux, Hay de Montigny. The branch which 
settled in Detroit was formerly called CuUlerier. In large fami- 
lies it was then often a custom to add the mother's family name to 
distinguish the different branches, viz. : Des Rivieres de la Morand- 
ifere ‚Äî Cuillerier de Beaubien. 

Rene Cuillerier, son of Julien and Julienne Fairf eu de Clermont, 
near La I"16che, came to Montreal, married there Marie Lecault

to be educated but was lost at sea returning to Canada. Jean, born 
in 1670, married in 1696, Catherine Trotier de Beaubien, from 
whom the Beaubiens of Michigan descend. Jean died in 1708, 
and Catherine married in 1713, Picot¬ß de Bellestre, and accompa- 
nied him to his post at Fort Pontchartrain. He was ensign in the 
French army, brother-in-law of de Tonty and de Celeron, former 
commandants of Fort Pontchartrain. He died there in 1729, 
leaving one son, Francois Marie Piquote de Bellestfe, the last 
French commander of that fort. By the first husband, Jean Cuil- 
leriei*; Catherine had two sons: 1. Jean Baptiste dit Beaubien,

ine married in 1829 Monique DesComptes Labadie, daughter

left a portion of his estate (known as the Antoine Beaubien farm) 
to charitable purposes. The present site of the Sacred Heart Con- 
vent in Detroit was their residence. Pierre, Jean Marie's son, 
-married in 1824 Catherine Edesse Dequindre, daughter of Antoine 
and Catherine Des Riviferes de la Morandifire, whose daughter

usual sight to see him ploughing with his sword at his side.

DESNOYSBS. 



There are many families of this name who settled at an early- 
period in this country. The Detroit branch traces direct to France 
through Pierre Jean Desnoyers, who established himself at Detroit 
shortly after the American possession in 1796. He was the son of

Jean Charles and Marie Charlotte Mallet, St. Bartholomi Parish, 
Paris. Pierre immediately took an active interest in the aifairs of 
the little town which he had chosen for the cradle of his race. He 
was universally respected as a thorough Christian, an upright, en- 
terprising citizen, a courteous and charming companion. 

July 30th, 1798, he married Marie Louise Goheil, whose saintly 
life is mirrored in that of her daughters. Many children came to 
bless the union of this happy couple : 1. Pierre, married in 1831, 
Caroline Leib, daughter of John and Marguerite O'Connor of 
Philadelphia. She left two children. Dr. Edmund Desnoyers and 
Emilie who married the talented artist Emilc St. Alary. Pierre

Marie Desnoyers, married Wm. Casgrain, a member of that dis- 
tinguished family of Canada. She resides at Milwaukee, Wis. ;

pastor of the Pro. Cathedral, (St. Aloysius) Detroit; Josephine Des-

tant positions. He was President of St. John's College, Md., 
Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, IJ. S. Commissioner of 
Education. One son and two daughters are the children of this 
marriage. The son, Henry D., resides in Detroit, is an accom- 
plished, studious gentleman , ambitious and likely to obtain emi- 
nence' in the political world, in which he has already attained 
position and reputation of which many an older man might well 
be proud. He married in 1878, Kittie, daughter of Judge Chas. 
Moran, and Justine McCormack. 

DOUAIRE DE BONDY. 



This family is still to bo found among the haute noblesse of 
Prance. It was once very influential in Canada, allied to the 
Pleury de la Gorgondifere, de Vaudreuil, Joliet, Godefroy, d'A- 
mours, and others. Thomas Douaire de Bondy came to Canada 
in 1650, and mai-ried Marguerite de Chavigny, daughter of Fran- 
cois, Seigneur de Champennois in France, and the great heiress, 
Eleonore de Grandmaison. This Eleonore though married three 
times always signed her maiden name to deeds and documents. 
Thomas was drowned whilst bathing near his residence, the Isle 
d'Orleans, leaving a rich young widow and four children. She 
married in 1671, Alexis de Fleury d'Eschambault and became the 
ancestress of the powerful Fleury de la Gorgondiere family 
whose deeds and exploits fill the annals of Canada. Bj' her first 
marriage with Douaire de Bondy she had the following children: 
1. DoROTHEB, married, in France, Count Fabian d'Albergati. Her 
son, Marie Luc, Marquis d'Albergati, married, in 1757, Char-

married, 1st, Pierre AUemand, in 1693 Nicolas Pineau; 3. Au- 
GUSTIN, married 1693, Catherine Testard de la Forest. A grand-

tigny, daughter of Chevalier Jean Baptiste and Charlotte Trotier 
des Rivieres; 4. Jacques, married 1660, Madeliene Gatineau du 
Plessis, daughter of JSTicolas, Sieur du Plessis and Marie Crevier. 
1. Jacques, married 1738, Mari'^ Damours whose family goes back 
to 1496, Fran9ois Seigneur du Serin who belonged to the royal 
household of Louis XII. Marie's grandfather, Seigneur de la 
Morandifire, came to Canada in 1653. His brother was a Mare- 
chal de Prance.

DTJBOIS. 



Several branches of this family settled at Detroit: Dubois dit 
Tilliau; Dubois dit Durebois, or Brisebois. It was the family 
name of the sixth French Governor of Canada, Pierre Dubois, 
Baron D'Avaugour. In 1754 Jean Baptists Dubois (Durebois), son 
of Jean Francois and Marianne Prudhomme of Quebec, married, 
-at Detroit, Cliarlotte Des Hestres, daughter of Antoine and Char- 
lotte Chartier. Their children were: 1. Pierre Amable. born 1755; 
3. Jean Louis.born 1 758, died young; 3. Susanne,born 1759 ; 4. Mari- 
anne, born 1760. In 1760 Francois Dubois, a brother of Jean 
Baptiste, married Susanne Durivage. The one who left his name 
to the present Dubois Farm was Etienne, son of Etienne and Marie 
Charlotte de Lacelle of Montreal. He came to Detroit several 
vears previous to the American possession; in 1793 he married 
Marguerite, daughter of Alexis (Badi) Descomptes Labadie and 
Francoise Robert ‚Äî to whom he was distantly related through his 
impther. James, a son of this union, married, in 1839, Sophie 
Campau, daughter of Jacques and Josette Chesne. He died a 
few years ago, leaving to his children his large estate, and the repu- 
tation of an honorable man and upright citizen. His children 
are: Louis, married Julie Si. Aubin, daughter of Louis and 
TherSse Chapoton; Emilie, married M. de Girardin; Elizabeth, 
married Julian Williams. 

aABESLIN.

of her husband, Francois You, Sieur de la Decouverte, became 
the celebrated foundress of the Grey Nuns at Montreal. Louise 
was the daughter of Christopher DuFros, and Renes Gaultier. 
The sons of Ignace and Louise came to Detroit in 1760. 
They were Medor and Antoine ‚Äî the former married, _ in 
1767, Angelique Oicotte; he was very prominent in getting 
up the first militia under French rule and was appointed 
Major; he died in 1778. Antoine, his brother, married his 
cousin Catherine Gamelin, daughter of Laurent, who had come- 
to Fort Pontchartrain before his cousins; he was the son 
of Pierre and Jeanne Maugras, allied to the Boucher de- 
Boncherville. He had married Josette Budevoir Lachine, by 
whom he had the following children: Marie Jeanne, born 1743, 
married Jean LeGras; Catherine, born 1744, married 1765, 
Antoine Gamelin, son of Ignace and Louise DuFros de la Jam- 
merais; Josette, married 1758, Joseph Douaire de Bondy, who

The children of this marriage -were: Francois, died unmarried; 
Susannc, born 1796. married Audrain Abbott, son of Robert and 
Elizabeth Audrain. She still lives, (1883) having outlived every- 
member of her family (save a grandson) and ihe friends of her youth. 
Few, in conversing with her, would imagine that her years num- 
bered eighty-seven. The kindling eye, dark hair, and charming 
grace and courtesy of manner make her an attractive companion 
to the young and old. She is a thorough type of the Old Regime,, 
which in her will lose one of its last representatives.

GODEFROY. 



This name, at present written Godfrey, is among the oldest in- 
Normandy. In some of its branches there is a tradition of a des- 
cent from Godef roi de Bouillon, the crusader. In the chambers 
of the courts of Normandy at Rouen, we find many of the names 
enrolled among the "haute noblesse." Several were eminent as 
priests and historians. Denis, Councillor in the Parliament of 
Paris, 1580, was the author of several valuable legal works, his 
son Jacques Was Secretary of State and Syndic of the Republic, 
his grandson was made historiographer of France, in 1640, and 
wrote the history of the Constables and Chancellors of France. A 
branch of this family resided in Normandy in 1580, whose head 



‚Ä¢300 Legends of Le Detroit. 

was Pien-e. His sou Jean Bapte came to Canada about 1635. 
His marriage contract, a copy of which is before tlie writer, is 
dated Dec. 15, 1636, and is supposed to be the oldest one record- 
ed in Canada. His wife was Marie Le Neuf de Herison. His 
sous and kindred were ennobled in 1667, and received the Seigneuru 
de Linctot and the fiefs de Normandville, de Vieux Pont, de 
Roguetiliade, de Tonnancour, de Marboeuf, &amp;c., &amp;c. A sister 
‚ñ†of Jean Bapte, Anne, married Jacques Teslard de Montigny, 
whose descendant .Jean Bapte Montigny de Louvigny, commanded 
at Detroit, married there a d. of Lt.-Gov. Hay and Julie Reaume, 
another Pierre Testard de Fortville married Catherine Chesne, of 
Detroit. Rene de Tonnancour, of Three Rivers, was Procureur 
du Roi, Lt.-Gten., &amp;c. His branch was at one time very promi- 
nent, and several of its members were decorated with the Cross of 
St. Louis, Maurice being among the last to receive it in 1784. The 
old church at Three Rivers, richly endowed by the Godefroys, 
still has the arms of this family superbly curved on the Banc 
d'Oeuvres. 

In 1715 Pierre Godefroy de Roquetaliade, grandson of Jean 
Bapte de Linctot, came to Detroit. He was followed shortly 
afterwards by Jacques Godefroy de Marboeuf. In 1750, Jean. 
Bapte Godefroy, called the Chevalier, came to Detroit yi^th his 
wife, Jeanne Veron de Grandmesnil, and died there in 1756. 
Pierre and Jacques both married into the same family. Jacques 
married 1716, Marie Chesne St. Onge. Pierre married 1734, 
, Catherine Sanduge, and his step-daughter married Charles Chesne 
St. Onge. Like others of the name they were interested in the 
fur trade, which was originally a monopoly carried on by a com- 
pany called the Hundred Associates, and later by the Companie 
des Indes. As early as 1687, it was said that 25,000 beaver skins 
alone were exported from Quebec in a single ship. The immense 
destruction of fur bearing animals led to the extension of the 
trading posts to the far west. Pierre's line died out. 

The children of Jacques were: Catherine, b. 1717, at Three Rivers, 
named from her godmother, Catherine Godefroy de Roqiietaliade 
married Nov. 21st,1733, the Chevalier Alex. Trotier des Ruisseaux, 
of an illustrious family. He was the first trustee of Ste. Anne's 
and first Capt. of Militia. The witnesses of this marriage were : De 
Noyelle, Commander of the Post ; Le Gardeur de Courtemanche, 
Lt. of Marines; Sieurs Chas. and Pierre Chesne; Louis Campeau; 
Barrois, Beaubien, Alexis Bienvenu Delisle. In 1777 she died, and 
she is recorded as the daughter of the deceased nobleman Godefroy 
de Marboeuf; this is the last time that the title is mentioned; 
Angeliqua, born 1719, married Jan. 8th, 1736, Zacharie Cicotte, a 
wealthy merchant ; the marriage contract is given under the 
Cicotte family; the witnesses of the marriage were : Hughes 
Pean, Chevalier of St. Louis, Pierre Chesne La Butte, Francois 



Early French Families. 301 

Prejent, Dagneaux Douville, Jean Bapte Chapoton; Jacques, 
born 1723, was very young at the time of his parents' death, and 
was brought up by his eldest sister, Catherine des Ruisseaux. 
Like his father he was interested in the fur trade. He was 
thoroughly familiar with the Indian tongues; and exerting great 
influence with the chiefs, by reason of his bravery and family con- 
nections, he soon became widely known as interpreter and 
negotiator between the savages and whites. He was ensign in his 
brother-in-law's, Alexis des Ruisseaux, company. After the fall of 
Quebec, Detroit was ceded to the English. Pontiac was at 
first disposed to resist the new comers, and had lie been aided by 
the French settlers it is doubtful whether the conquest of the 
country would have been effected. But they, relying upon the 
promises made in the treaty that all their rights would be re- 
spected, no resistance was made, and the garrison under Mons. de 
Bellestre surrendered, and were escorted to Philadelphia, leaving 
the French settlers at the mercy of the English troops. French 
accounts say that in the face of the treaty they were robbed of 
their property, deprived of their flre-arms, leaving them without 
defence against the Indians. It is not to be wondered that bitter 
feelings were engendered, and the English commanders, ignorant 
for the most part of the French and Indian languages, were sus- 
picious^ of constant plottings against them. It is a matter of sur- 
prise that the settlement, aided by their old Indian allies did not 
exterminate the English garrison, and their conduct under the cir- 
cumstances is a convincing proof that the characteristic honor 
and loyalty claimed for them existed in the highest degree. In 
1763, the haughty Ottawa warrior, who could no longer brook 
the arrogance of the British, attacked the fort at Detroit and the- 
other English posts. Jacques and Dr. Chapoton were sent by the 
Engli.sh commander to parley with Pontiac and endeavor to- 
dissuade him from his purpose, but the savage chieftain would not 
be influenced. Jacques and other prominent French inhabitants 
were suspected of encouraging Pontiac, and on the advent of 
General Bradsti-eet, they were arrested and charged with treason. 
In 1758, Jacques married Louise Clotilde Chapoton, daughter of 
Jean Chapoton, Surgeon in the French army. She died in 1764, 
leaving one son, Jacques Gabriel. Jacques devoted the remainder 
of his life to the care of his son, and the rebuilding of his fortune, 
which had suffered since the English conquest. He figures 
prominently in many of the Indian transfers of land. In the- 
American State papers is a curious deed in French from Jacques 
Godefroy to his son conveying to him farming lands, implements, 
cattle, silver and slaves. The land conveyed comprised the tract 
between 30th and 33nd streets from the river to some three miles- 
back, some of which is still owned by his descendants. He died 
in 1795. He evidently was very popular and generous, for he-

seems to have been for several years godfather to almost every 
child that was born, for pages of baptisms on the records have his 
name affixed, in his strong, bold handwriting. 

Jacques Gabriel, born 1758, within Fort Pontchartrain. He was 
named Gabriel from his godfather and uncle, Gabriel Le Grand, 
Chevalier de Sintre. About the time he came of age the American 
revolution was in progress. Though the colony was far removed 
from the scene of war, Gabriel's sympathies were with the colonists. 
His early years were spent in extending the fur trade and establish- 
ing trading posts on a large scale from Monroe to Fort Vincennes; 
the firm of Godfroy &amp; Beaugrand was one of the largest and best 
known in the West. After the American possession he received 
an appointment as sub-agent and deputy-superintendent of Indian. 
afEairs from Gen. Harrison (afterwards president of the U. S.). 
The records which have been preserved of his success in negotia- 
tions with the Indians are abundant, and he retained the position 
until his death in 1833. The ordinary duties were to repair to 
any post where difficulties might arise, and to reclaim -from mau- 
rading Indians stolen property, to pay the Indian annuities and 
to receive at his house all Indians who might arrive. Gabriel was 
Major of the 1st Kegiment of the Territory ; on the resignation of 
Augustus B. Woodward was made Colonel. He married Angelique 
de Couture, by whom he had five children: Gabriel, Jr., married 
JElizabeth, daughter of Hon. Jas. May; his descendants reside at 
Grand Rapids; J^an Baptiste settled at Fort Wayne, Ind. In 
1796 Gabriel married TherJse Douaire de Bondy, by whom he had 
several children. He died in 1831. He was one of the few who 
lived under French, English and American rule in the same place, 
and saw a change of flags five times. He married a third time 
Monique Campau, by whom he had no issue. 

Those by his second wife were: 1. Susanue, born 1794, married 
Jas. McCloskey. Her children were: Henry, married Ther6se 
Soulard, of St. Louis; Elizabeth, married Hon. Isaac P. Chris- 
tiancy; Caroline, married Mr. Calwell; Susanne, married Mr. 
Morton, brother of the late Julius Morton, of Detroit; Melinde, 
married John Askin, of Sandwich, Canada. 

2. Pien-e, "Le Prince" as he was generally called, was born 
1796. He removed the last remnant of the Indians about 
Detroit to their reservation in the far West. He was active 
and enterprising, and the firm of P. &amp; J. Godfroy was well known. 
He married Marianne Navarre Marentette, daughter of Dominique 
Gode de Marentette and Archange Louise Navarre ; she and her 
sister, Mrs. De Quindre (afterwards Mrs. Wni. B. Hunt), were 
‚Ä¢considered the most beautiful women in the Territory. It is a 
family tradition that Prince Godfroy once won a wager by pad- 
dling himself in a wheelbarrow across the Detroit river to visit his 
:fiancee, who lived on the Canadian shore, a feat quite as difficult

:possessor to the Lord or Seigneur by whom the fief is held; these 
rights are Quint and Relief. The Quint is the fifth part of the 
purchase money, and must be paid by the purchaser. Belief is the 
revenue of one year due to the Seigneur for certain mutations. If 
a fief came to a vassal by succession in the direct line, there was 
nothing due the Seigneur but fealty and homage; but if in the 
‚ñ† collateral line, then a fine was paid to the Seigneur upon taking 
the estate which had lapsed or fallen by the death of the last ten 
ant. Fiefs were divided by the "Contume de Paris" into two 
kinds: 1st, those held nobly; 3d, those held by villainage. The 
‚Ä¢estates held nobly are the fiefs, and Franc Alen noble. The 
estates held by villainage, were held subject to cens or censive, and 
Franc Alen villain. Franc Alen was a freehold estate held sub- 
ject to no seigneurical rights or duties, acknowledging no lord, 
but the king. Censive was an estate held in the feudal manner, 
‚Ä¢charged with a certain annual rent which was paid by the pos- 
sessor of it; it consisted of money, grain, fowls, etc. It was thus 
that most of the habitants in Canada held their farms. The " lods 
et ventes," or fines of alienation, were one-half part of the pur- 
-chase money, and were paid by the purchaser on all mutations of 
property "en roture" to the Seigneur in the same manner as the 
.quint was paid upon mutations of fiefs. The succession to fiefs 
-was different from that of property held "en roture" or byvil-

lainage. The eldest son took, by right, the principal manor house- 
or chateau, and the yard adjoining it ; also an acre of the garden 
joining it. If there were any mills, ovens or presses within the 
seigneuree, they belonged to the eldest son ; but the profits arising 
from the mills, ovens and presses, if common, were equally 
divided among the heirs. When there were only two heirs, the 
eldest took, besides the manor house, etc., two-thirds of the fief, 
and the youngest son the other third. But when there were more 
than two heirs, the eldest .son took one-half, and the other heirs 
the remaining half. When only daughters were the heirs, the fief 
was equally divided among them. If the eldest son died, the- 
next did not succeed to liis birth rights; the estate was then 
equally divided among the heirs.

LOTHMAN DE BARROIS. 



Many French families of to-day claim among their ancestors a 
Lothman de Barrois. Antoine Lothman de Barrols was sent to 
America in 1665, as Secretary, Councillor and Agent General of 
the East India Company. He was also interpreter of the Portu- 
guese language. He was the son of Jean and Marie Fournel, 
Chantel le Chateau, Diocese de Surges, Berry. He married, 1673, 
Marie Le Ber, whose family was a very distinguished one. She 
was a niece of Jeanne Le Ber de Senmenville, whose life has been 
written by the Historian Abbe Paillon. A branch of the Le Ber 
returned to Fi-ance, and the descendants all acquired fame and 
wealth. One was a page to Madame la Dauphine, another a gal- 
lant officer, killed on the field of Magenta. The Chevalier Ben- 
voist, through his mother, belonged to the Le Ber family. Francois 
Lothman and Marie Le Ber had several children, among them 
were: Marianne, born 1680, married 1697, Francois Houdoin; 
Philippe, born 1673; Francois, born 1676, married at Detroit 1717, 
Marianne Sauvage; Charles, born 1678; Antoine, born 1683. 
Francois, born 1676, married Marianne Sauvage, and established 
himself at Detroit ‚Äî their children were: Marie, born 1719, mar- 
ried 1734, Robert Kavarre, the Sub-Intendant and Royal Notary, 
and is the ancestress' of the Navarres; Louise, born 1722, married 
1736," Pierre Chesne La Butte, the interpreter; Catherine, born 
1737, married 1747, Pierre de St. Cosme, who was one of the 
earliest Justices of Peace. One of the daughters, Theotiste 
St. Cosme, married in 1776, Philippe De Jean, son of Philippe, 
Councillor and Senechal of Toulouse, and Jeanne De Roque. De 
Jean was a Judge under English rule. A great grand-daughter of 
Pierre St. Cosme became the first wife of Judge Jas. May. Cath- 
erine married again, Antoine Cuillerier de Beaubien, by whom 
she had many children. Antoine, born 1733 ; Agathe, born 1735, 
married Jean Bapte Reaume, son of Hyacinthe and Agathe de 
Lacelle; Laurent, married 1757, Catherine Cecyre. 

MORAND. 



The descendants of this family are very ably represented to-day 
in Detroit. Pierre, its founder in America, was born at Batiscan 
in 1651, married Madeleine Grimard 1678. His branch is fre- 
quently known as Morand dit Grimard, it being then customary 
to add the mother's family name, especially if she brought a large 
dower to her husband. Of this marriage many children were 
born whose descendants in Canada were noted as clergymen, 
lawyers, and landed proprietors. Jean Bapte, a son of Pierre's, 
married 1707, Elizabeth Dubois, at Quebec, whose son, Charles 
Morand Grimard came to establish himself at Detroit some time

before the English Conquest in 1760. There was at that time 
another branch of the same family, who settled at Detroit; another 
Charles, who married in 1751, Catherine Belleperche, who be- 
longed to the celebrated Couillard and Guyon De Buisson family, 
thus closely allied to La Mothe Cadillac's wife ; their children 
were: Louis, born 1756; Charles, born 1755; Joseph, born 1763, 
married 1790, Catharine Boyce; Louise and Therlse, boi'n 1769; 
Maurice, born 1775, married 1800, Felise Meloche; Marthe, mar- 
ried 1800, Louis Campeau; Susanne, married 1805, Francois 
Campeau, son of Jean Bapte. Chas. Morand-Grimard, married 
in 1767, Marguerite Simard Tremblay, whose family possessed 
the Seigneurie du Tremblay as early as 1681. She died in 1771, 
leaving two children : Louis, born 1769; Charles, born 1770. 
Louis, married 1794, Catherine Campeau, daughter of Jean Bapte 
and Catherine Boyce. One of his sons (George), married 1826, 
Therfese Tremblay, whose descendants reside at Grosse Pointe. 
Charles, married 1794, Catherine Vessier dit Laferte, whose only 
child was the late Judge Chas. Morand. Charles, Jr., married 
1822, Julie De Quindre, daughter of Antoine Daigneaux Douville 
De Quindre and Catherine des RiviSres de la Morandi^re. The 
children were: I.Matilda, married James Watson; 2. Charles; 
8. Julie, married Isaac Toll; 4. Virginie, married Francis St. 
Aubin; 5. Mary Josephine, married Robert] Mix, of Cleveland, 
O., Aug. 3rd, 1836; Judge Chas. Moran married Justine McCor- 
mack, of N. Y., by whom he had the following children: 1. James, 
died unmarried; 2. William B., married 1872, Elise, daughter of 
James J. Vandyke, in 1875, Frances, daughter of Pierre 
Desnoyers. His administrative faculty, his successful land oper- 
ations have placed him in the foremost rank of Detroit capitalists. 
3. John Vallie, married 1880, Emma Etheridge, daughter of the dis- 
tinguished orator and politician, Emerson Etheridge, of Tennessee. 
He is one of the most successful business men of Detroit, and his 
sterling personal worth has made him deservedly popular; 4. Cath- 
erine, married 1877, Henry D. Barnard, of Hartford, Conn. ; S.Alfred 
is a lawyer, and in partnership with his brother, Wm. B. Moran. 
He married, 1878, Satilda Butterfield. Judge Chas. Moran died in 
1876, leaving the most valuable estate, with the exception of the 
Brush and Campau, in Detroit. Charles inherited this magnifi- 
cent property from his grandfather, Charles Moran Grimard. 
The family dropped the " d " at the end of the name, and also the 
title Grimard about 1796. To the peculiar conservatism of the 
French settler to-day, so frequently and unjustly misunderstood 
are their descendants indebted for the preservation of their ances- 
tral estates. A brief glance at the early history of Detroit will 
convince the candid and unbiased reader, that the position of the 
habitants during the various political changes which Detroit 
underwent was one requiring delicate tact and diplomatic ability

Five successive flags waved over the fair "City of the Straits." 
One form of Government had scarcely enforced its laws and ex- 
plained its policy before it vanished and gave place to another 
power. A disastrous fire destroyed their records. It is not 
strange that these country-tossed settlers looked with suspicion 
and indifference upon new ideas and improvements, their experi- 
ence not having taught them to place much confidence in the 
existing orders of things. The old traditional conservatism has 
fulfilled its mission, and handed to the present generation valu- 
able estates, which, under the progi-essive management and en- 
larged ideas, founded upon a permanent form of Government, 
will bring not only princely revenues to its owners, but be later 
a source of pride to the city. 

NAVABRE. 



This family so illustrious in the early days of the colony traces 
back in an unbroken line to Antoine de Bourbon, Duke de Ven- 
dome, father of Henry 4th, whose natural son, (IJ Jean Navarre, 
married 15T3 Perette Barat; (2) his son Martin Navarre de Villeroy 
married 1593 Jeanne Lefebre, whose son (3) Jean Navarre, mar- 
ried 1623, Susanna Le Clef ; their son (4) Antoine Navarre, du 
Plessis en Bois, married 1665, Marie Lallemant, whose son (5) 
Antoine Marie Francois Navarre, married 1695, Jeanne Pluyette, 
whose son (6) Robert Navarre, was sent to Fort Pontchartrain as 
Sub-Intendant and Royal Notary, where he married, 1734, Marie 
Lothman de Barrels, his son Robert (Robishe) married, 1762, 
Marie Louise Archange de Mersac, whose daughter Archange 
Louise, married 1796, Dominique Gode de Marantette, whose 
daughter, Marianne Navarre, married 1832, Pierre Godfrey. 
Antoine Navarre du Plessis' other sons remained in France, and 
one of them married Catherine de la Rue ; their only daughter 
married Jean Navarre de Livry (her first cousin) whose daughter 
in turn, Marie Jeanne Navarre, born 1709, married Jean Louis 
Navarre de Maisonneuxe (her cousin) brother of Mons. de Navarre, 
Marquis de Longuejoue, whose wife, born at St. Luce, was lady 
of honor (Dame d'Honneur) to Madame Elizabeth, sister of Louis 
16th of France and the Duchess of Bourbon. Catherine Antoin- 
ette, Jeanne Martine Petronille, remained the only daughter by 
the death of her two sisters. She married Louis Francois Margue- 
let de la Noue, from whom Genevieve Celerie Marguelet de la 
None, eldest sister of Madame de Penteville, espoused Count 
Leoud Perthuis, whose daughter Marie Celine Leontiue de 
Perthuis, espoused Alex. Jacqiies Marie Clement de Blavette, 
whose son Edward married Marie Clement le Boulanger de Mont- 
igny, whose son Count Leon Clement de Blavette married Isabell 
de Brossard, de Versaille, France. 



308 Legends of Le Detroit. 

Robert Navarre, son of Antoine Francois. Marie and Jeanne 
Pluyette came to Detroit to fill the most important position in the 
colony. He was responsible to no one save the Intendant at Que- 
bec. He added to this office that of Royal Notary. Following an 
old manuscript copied from the Cahinet, a scarce periodical issued 
at New York, 1827-1831 : Robert de Navarre came to America and 
landed at Quebec. He was of a noble French family, a man of ex- 
tensive erudition, was appointed under the French government sub- 
del egue and Royal Notary at Detroit. He married there in 1734, Ma- 
rie Lothman de Barrels. At the marriage were present Hugues Pean, 
Seigneur de Livaudifere, Hereditary Mayor of Quebec, Chevalier 
of St. Louis, Commandant of Fort Pontchartrain, Pierre Gode- 
froy de Roquetaliade, Duburron Ensign, Daigneaux Douville and 
Chas. Chesne, Bonaventure, Ptre. Robert Navarre's children were: 
CI) Marie Francoise, born 1735, married Geo. McDougall, Lt. in 
the British Army, by whom she had two sons, Jean Robert and 
George. In 1774 she married Jacques Campeau, father of Joseph 
and Barnabe, by whom she had no heirs, but Barnabe in 1820 
married her granddaughter, Archange McDougall, whose sons 
were Alexander and the late Barnab¬ß. 

(2) Marianne, born 1737, married 1760, Jacques AdhSmar St. 
Martin, frequently called La Butte, a most celebrated interpreter. 
They lived in the old Cass House, which was the St. Martin home- 
stead, the ground being deeded to him in 1750. St. Martin died in 
1766, leaving a young widow with three children : (1) St. Martin, 
who died unmarried; (3) Finon who married Philip Fry; (3) Arch- 
ange, born 1765, married August Mcintosh, who later on inherited 
the estates which belonged to the Earldom of Moy, the Earldom 
itself having been forfeited in the rebellion against the House of 
Hanover. The Mcintosh homestead was on the Canadian shore op- 
posite Belle Isle, and was celebrated along Le Detroit for the prince- 
ly and lavish hospitality of its genial owner. Ten children were 
born to Angus Mcintosh, the boys returned to Scotland to take 
possession of their estates. Two of the daughters were much 
loved and esteemed in Detroit, Mrs. Henry J. Hunt and Miss 
Catherine Mcintosh. In 1770, Marianne Navarre widow of St. 
Martin, bestowed her hand upon Dr. Geo. Christian Anthon who 
had come to Detroit, in 1760, with Mayor Rogers. She died Oct. 
11th, 1776, leaving no heirs by Anthon. 

Robert, eldest son of Robert, Sr. , surnamed Robishe the Speaker, 
was born in 1739. He married, 1762, Louise Archange de Mersaci 
daughter of Francois and Charlotte Bourassa. Another Charlotte 
Bourassa, a cousin, married in 1760, Chas. de Langlade, the pioneer 
settler of Wisconsin, whose family belonged to that of the Count of 
Paris. To Robishe was deeded by the Pottawatomies, their village, 
which was on a beautiful eminence commanding a fine view and 
which even then was pronounced by them an "Ancient Village." 



Early French Families. 309 

"We the chiefs of the tribe of the Pottawatomie nation at Detroit 
have deliberated and given of our own free will a piece of land of 
four arpents in width by the whole depth, situated at our ancient 
village to Robishe, son of the Scrivener. We give him this land 
forever, that he might cultivate the same, light a lire thereon, and 
take care of our dead, and for surety of our words we have made 
ourmarks." This gi-ant was ratified by Henry Bassett, command- 
ing at Detroit, July 15, 1773, in presence of Greo. McDougall. On 
one of Navarre's quit rent receipts it is stated that this tract was 
confirmed by Gen. G-age. Robishe resided on his land and in the 
house known to-day as the Brevoort homestead. It was later 
enlarged by Commodore Brevoort (Robishe's son-in-law). Robishe 
was the great great grandfather of the writer, and there still lives 
an old lady who remembers him. She speaks of him as a pre- 
eminently handsome man, with courtly manners, most engaging 
and charming in conversation. He was blessed like all the French 
of that period, with an exceptionally large family : (1) Robert, born 
1764; (2) Jacques, born 1766, he settled on the River Raisin; 
(3) Francois, born 1767, early removed with his brother Jacques 
and Jean ;Marie to Monroe, where twenty-six arpents had been 
deeded to the Navarres by the Ottawas. Francois was Colonel 
during the war of 1812-13, and figures most conspicuously. His 
house was the headquarters of Generals Wayne, Winchester, St. 
Clair and others. Thirty-six Navarres served in his regiment. 
He was thoroughly conversant with the peculiar habits and war- 
fare of the savages, and spoke with f acilitj"- several of their lan- 
guages. He was captured at Brownstown, whither he had gone 
ahead of Col. Johnston to negotiate with the Indians; he was 
taken as prisoner to Sandwich, but fortunately escaped. His son 
Robert served under Capt. Richard Smythe, and told the writer 
many amusing anecdotes of the war. The only French pear trees 
along the Raisin, are those that were brought there by Col. 
Navan-e from his father's place in Detroit. Francois was the per- 
sonal friend of Wayne, Winchester, St. Clair, Cass, Macomb and 
Woodward, and his correspondence with several of them has been 
preserved. 

He married, 1790, Marie Suzord, daughter of Louis and Marie 
Josette Lebeau ; his children were : Robert, born 1793; Francois, 
born 1793; Victoire, married 1833, Jacques Godfrey, son of Col. 
Gabriel and Therfise Douaire de Bondy. Agathe was exquisitely 
beautiful; Julie died at an advanced age unmarried; Monique 
married John Askin eldest son of Col. James Askin, of Sand- 
wich. 

4. Isidore, born 1768, married 1795, Francoise Desoomptes La- 
badie, daughter of Alexis and Francoise Robert. Their eldest 
son Isidore, born 1795, though a mere stripling served in the war 
of 1813.

PELLETIER. 



History states that when ta Mothe Cadillac landed at Betroit he 
was greeted by two Coureurs des Bois, Pierre Roy and Francois 
Pelletier. This latter name stands very high in Canada and is 
found in every department of science and politics. Nicolas the 
first of the name came from Beance (France) and married in 1675 
Jeanne Roussy. They settled at Sorrel, and left eight children to 
propagate their race. The eldest son Francois married Margue- 
rite Madeleine Morrisseau by whom he had ten; one of them 
Marie Angelique, married 1709, Antoine de Gerlais, she was the
