      <a name="PhiloBio"></a> <font size="4"><b>A Short Biography</b></font> 
      <p><font size="2">Philo Paul was a farmer and operated a sawmill in the 
        village of Amity, Washington County, Pennsylvania. He was a community 
        leader and was a founder and an original Trustee of the Pleasant Valley 
        Academy, a community school sponsored by the Pleasant Valley Christian 
        Church for all the children in the area.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">When</font><font size="2"> President Lincoln called for 
        300,000 more volunteers to re-enforce the Union Army Philo joined 66 other 
        men from Amity and the surrounding country to respond. In August, 1862, 
        these 67 men joined 31 others from other parts of Washington and Greene 
        Counties to form the Amity Company, which would soon become Company D 
        of the 140<sup>th</sup> Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">He left behind his wife, Sarah, and their nine children: 
        William Wallace, James Monroe, John Adams, Daniel Webster, Alexander Hamilton, 
        David Clayton, Benjamin Franklin, Abraham Lincoln and Laura Jewell.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In his military career, Philo was recognized for both 
        his bravery and soldierly appearance.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">On May 3, 1863 at Chancellorsville, Company D sent a small 
        detachment of volunteers, including Philo, onto the field outside the 
        Chancellorsville House to retrieve the four cannon of the 5th Main Battery 
        (Lepine's) as the Confederates bombarded them from their position at &quot;Fairview&quot;, 
        only a few hundred yards away.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">A</font><font size="2"> Company D comrade recounted that, 
        &quot;One day at Brandy Station, Va., when an officer was inspecting the 
        Regiment, as he came to Philo Paul and saw how erect he stood and noticed 
        his determined look, his clean gun, polished gun barrel and brass pieces, 
        he stopped in front of him and said: 'There is a model soldier.'&quot;</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font size="2">Philo was killed on May 12, 1864 at Spotsylvania Court 
        House, Virginia, when the 140th Regiment was among the first of 20,000 
        Union soldiers who assaulted an entrenched Confederate position. In order 
        to maintain the element of surprise, the firing caps were removed from 
        their rifles. General Nelson Miles, their brigade commander, later reported 
        that they were ordered to &quot;use nothing but their bayonets until they 
        had gained the enemy's position.&quot; Rather than have a stray shot from 
        an impatient Federal warn the Rebels of their approach, the Union attackers 
        marched silently through the pre-dawn fog in a block 1/4 mile wide and 
        swept over the Confederate defenders in what would become known as the 
        Bloody Angle.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">A bullet passed through Philo's heart and he was buried 
        on the field with his good friend Amos Swart and fellow church member 
        Thomas Doty. They were buried by Thomas' brother William and another soldier, 
        perhaps James Hathaway. Those buried on the battlefield were later re-interred 
        in the Fredericksburg National Cemetery, where Pvt. Paul presumably lies 
        today among the &quot;unknowns&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">After the war, upon the formation of the Grand Army of 
        the Republic, the fraternal organization of Union veterans, his comrades 
        named the Amity post in his honor - The Philo Paul Post 458 G. A. R.</font></p>
