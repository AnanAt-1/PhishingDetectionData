<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Can Thine Heart Endure</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>"We know not what we should pray for as we ought"</i> (Rom. 8:26).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Much that perplexes us in our Christian experience is but the answer to our prayers. We pray for patience, and our Father sends those who tax us to the utmost; for <i>"tribulation worketh patience."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We pray for submission, and God sends sufferings; for <i>"we learn obedience by the things we suffer."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We pray for unselfishness, and God gives us opportunities to sacrifice ourselves by thinking on the things of others, and by laying down our lives for the brethren.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We pray for strength and humility, and some messenger of Satan torments us until we lie in the dust crying for its removal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We pray, "Lord, increase our faith," and money takes wings; or the children are alarmingly ill; or a servant comes who is careless, extravagant, untidy or slow, or some hitherto unknown trial calls for an increase of faith along a line where we have not needed to exercise much faith before.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We pray for the Lamb-life, and are given a portion of lowly service, or we are injured and must seek no redress; for "he was led as a lamb to the slaughter and opened not his mouth."</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We pray for gentleness, and there comes a perfect storm of temptation to harshness and irritability. We pray for quietness, and every nerve is strung to the utmost tension, so that looking to Him we may learn that when He giveth quietness, no one can make trouble.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We pray for love, and God sends peculiar suffering and puts us with apparently unlovely people, and lets them say things which rasp the nerves and lacerate the heart; for love suffereth long and is kind, love is not impolite, love is not provoked. LOVE BEARETH ALL THINGS, believeth, hopeth and endureth, love never faileth. We pray for likeness to Jesus, and the answer is, "I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction." "Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong?" "Are ye able?"</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The way to peace and victory is to accept every circumstance, every trial, straight from the hand of a loving Father; and to live up in the heavenly places, above the clouds, in the very presence of the Throne, and to look down from the Glory upon our environment as lovingly and divinely appointed. --Selected</p><p style="text-align: center;">I prayed for strength, and then I lost awhile<br />All sense of nearness, human and divine;<br />The love I leaned on failed and pierced my heart,<br />The hands I clung to loosed themselves from mine;<br />But while I swayed, weak, trembling, and alone,<br />The everlasting arms upheld my own.</p><p style="text-align: center;">I prayed for light; the sun went down in clouds,<br />The moon was darkened by a misty doubt,<br />The stars of heaven were dimmed by earthly fears,<br />And all my little candle flames burned out;<br />But while I sat in shadow, wrapped in night,<br />The face of Christ made all the darkness bright.</p><p style="text-align: center;">I prayed for peace, and dreamed of restful ease,<br />A slumber drugged from pain, a hushed repose;<br />Above my head the skies were black with storm,<br />And fiercer grew the onslaught of my foes;<br />But while the battle raged, and wild winds blew,<br />I heard His voice and Perfect peace I knew.</p><p style="text-align: center;">I thank Thee, Lord, Thou wert too wise to heed<br />My feeble prayers, and answer as I sought,<br />Since these rich gifts Thy bounty has bestowed<br />Have brought me more than all I asked or thought;<br />Giver of good, so answer each request<br />With Thine own giving, better than my best.</p><p style="text-align: center;">--Annie Johnson Flint</p><p style="text-align: center;">(Taken from <i>Streams In The Desert</i> Devotional)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While I am not a Calvinist, there is so much I have gleaned from several of Arthur W. Pink's writings, such as Comfort For Christians, The Seven Sayings Of The Saviour On The Cross, The Life Of David, and Why Four Gospels? While these particular books are great, please read with discernment and caution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This short chapter is taken from the book entitled <i>Comfort For Christians, Chapter Six:</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Tried by Fire</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: justify;"><i>"But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold."</i><br /></span><span style="text-align: justify;">Job 23:10</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Job here corrects himself. In the beginning of the chapter we find him saying: "Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning" (vv. 1, 2). Poor Job felt that his lot was unbearable. But he recovers himself. He checks his hasty outburst and revises his impetuous decision. How often we all have to correct ourselves! Only One has ever walked this earth who never had occasion to do so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Job here <i>comforts himself</i>. He could not fathom the mysteries of Providence but God knew the way he took. Job had diligently sought the calming presence of God, but, for a time, in vain. Behold I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him. On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him" (vv. 8, 9). But he consoled himself with this blessed fact - though I cannot see God, what is a thousand times better, He can see me - "He knoweth." One above is neither unmindful nor indifferent to our lot. If He notices the fall of a sparrow, if He counts the hairs of our heads, of course "He knows" the way that I take.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Job here enunciates a noble view of life. How splendidly optimistic he was! He did not allow his afflictions to turn him into a skeptic. He did not permit the sore trials and troubles through which he was passing to overwhelm him. He looked at the bright side of the dark cloud - God's side, hidden from sense and reason. He took a long view of life. He looked beyond the immediate " fiery trials" and said that the outcome would be gold refined. "But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold." Three great truths are expressed here: let us briefly consider each separately.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>1. The Divine Knowledge of My Life</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">"He knoweth the way that I take." The omniscience of God is one of the wondrous attributes of Deity. "For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings" (Job 34:21). "The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good (Prov. 15:3). Spurgeon said, "One of the greatest tests of experimental religion is, What is my relationship to God's omniscience?" What is your relationship to it, dear reader? How does it affect you? Does it distress or comfort you? Do you shrink from the thought of God knowing all about your way? perhaps, a lying, selfish, hypocritical way! To the sinner this is a terrible thought. He denies it, or if not, he seeks to forget it. But to the Christian, here is real comfort. How cheering to remember that my Father knows all about my trials, my difficulties, my sorrows, my efforts to glorify Him. Precious truth for those in Christ, harrowing thought for all out of Christ, that the way I am taking is fully known to and observed by God.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"He knoweth the way that I take." Men did not know the way that Job took. He was grievously misunderstood, and for one with a sensitive temperament to be misunderstood, is a sore trial. His very friends thought he was a hypocrite. They believed he was a great sinner and being punished by God. Job knew that he was an unworthy saint, but not a hypocrite. He appealed against their censorious verdict. "He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold." Here is instruction for us when like circumstanced. Fellow-believer, your fellow-men, yes, and your fellow Christians, may misunderstand you, and misinterpret God's dealings with you: but console yourself with the blessed fact that the omniscient One knows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"He knoweth the way that I take." In the fullest sense of the word Job himself did not know the way that he took, nor do any of us. Life is profoundly mysterious, and the passing of the years offer no solution. Nor does philosophizing help us. Human volition is a strange enigma. Consciousness bears witness that we are more than automatons. The power of choice is exercised by us in every move we make. And yet it is plain that our freedom is not absolute. There are forces brought to bear upon us, both good and evil, which are beyond our power to resist. Both heredity and environment exercise powerful influences upon us. Our surroundings and circumstances are factors which cannot be ignored. And what of providence which "shapes our destinies"? Ah, how little do we know the way which we "take." Said the prophet, "O LORD I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps (Jer. 10:23). Here we enter the realm of mystery, and it is idle to deny it. Better far to acknowledge with the wise man, "Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?" (Prov. 20:24).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the narrower sense of the term Job did know the way which he took. What that "way" was he tells us in the next two verses. "My foot hath held his steps. his way have I kept, and not declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food" (Job 23:11, 12). The way Job chose was the best way, the scriptural way, God's way - "His way." What do you think of that way, dear reader? Was it not a grand selection? Ah, not only "patient," but wise Job! Have you made a similar choice? Can you say, My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined?" (v. 11). If you can, praise Him for His enabling grace. If you cannot, confess with shame your failure to appropriate His all-sufficient grace. Get down on your knees at once, and unbosom yourself to God. Hide and keep back nothing. Remember it is written "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). Does not verse 12 explain your failure, my failure, dear reader? Is it not because we have not trembled before God's commandments, and because we have so lightly esteemed His Word, that we have "declined" from His way! Then let us, even now, and daily, seek grace from on high to heed His commandments and hide His Word in our hearts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"He knoweth the way that I take." Which way are you taking? - the Narrow Way which leadeth unto life, or - the Broad Road that leadeth to destruction? Make certain on this point, dear friend. Scripture declares, "So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God" (Rom. 14:12). But you need not be deceived or uncertain. The Lord declared, "I am The Way" (John 14:6).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>2. Divine Testing</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">"When he hath tried me." "The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts" (Prov. 17:3). This was God's way with Israel of old, and it is His way with Christians now. Just before Israel entered Canaan, as Moses reviewed their history since leaving Egypt, he said, "And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, and to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or no" (Deut. 8:2). In the same way God tries, tests, proves, humbles us.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"When he hath tried me." If we realized this more, we should bear up better in the hour of affliction and be more patient under suffering. The daily irritations of life, the things which annoy so much - what is their meaning? why are they permitted? Here is the answer: God is "trying" you! That is the explanation (in part, at least) of that disappointment, that crushing of your earthly hopes, that great loss; God was, is,&nbsp; testing you. God is trying your temper, your courage, your faith, your patience, your love, your fidelity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"When he hath tried me." How frequently God's saints see only Satan as the cause of their troubles. They regard the great enemy as responsible for much of their sufferings. But there is no comfort for the heart in this. We do not deny that the Devil does bring about much that harasses us. But above Satan is the Lord Almighty! The Devil cannot touch a hair of our heads without God's permission, and when he is allowed to disturb and distract us, even then it is only God using him to "try" us. Let us learn then, to look beyond all secondary causes and instruments to that One who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will (Eph. 1:11). This is what Job did.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the opening chapter of the book which bears his name we find Satan obtaining permission to afflict God's servant. He used the Sabeans to destroy Job's herds (v. 15): he sent the Chaldeans to slay his servants (v. 17): he caused a great wind to kill his children (v. 19). And what was Job's response? This: he exclaimed "The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD" (1:21). Job looked beyond the human agents, beyond Satan who employed them, to the Lord who controls all. He realized that it was the Lord trying him. We get the same thing in the New Testament. To the suffering saints at Smyrna John wrote, "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried" (Rev. 2:10). Their being cast into prison was simply God trying them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">How much we lose by forgetting this! What a stay for the trouble-tossed heart to know that no matter what form the testing may take, no matter what the agent which annoys, it is God who is "trying" His children. What a perfect example the Saviour sets us. When He was approached in the garden and Peter drew his sword and cut off the ear of Malchus, the Saviour said, "The cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11). Men were about to vent their awful rage upon Him, the Serpent would bruise His heel, but He looks above and beyond them. Dear reader, no matter how bitter its contents, (infinitely less than that which the Saviour drained) let us accept the cup as from the Father's hand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In some moods we are apt to question the wisdom and right of God to try us. So often we murmur at His dispensations. Why should God lay such an intolerable burden upon me? Why should others be spared their loved ones, and mine taken? Why should health and strength, perhaps the gift of sight, be denied me? The first answer to all such questions is, "O man, who art thou that repliest against God?"! It is wicked insubordination for any creature to call into question the dealings of the great Creator. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?" (Rom. 9:20). How earnestly each of us need to cry unto God, that His grace may silence our rebellious lips and still the tempest within our desperately wicked hearts!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But to the humble soul which bows in submission before the sovereign dispensations of the all-wise God, Scripture affords some light on the problem. This light may not satisfy reason, but it will bring comfort and strength when received in child-like faith and simplicity. In 1 Pet. 1:6 we read; "Wherein (God's salvation) ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations (or trials): That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ." Note three things here. First, there is a needs-be for the trial of faith. Since God says it, let us accept it. Second, this trying of faith is precious, far more so than of gold. It is precious to God (cf. Ps. 116:15) and will yet be so to us. Third, the present trial has in view the future. Where the trial has been meekly endured and bravely borne, there will be a grand reward at the appearing of our Redeemer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Again, in 1 Peter 4:12, 13 we are told: "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings: that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy." The same thoughts are expressed here as in the previous passage. There is a needs-be for our "trials" and therefore we are to think them not strange - we should expect them. And, too, there is again the blessed outlook of being richly recompensed at Christ's return. Then there is the added word that not only should we meet these trials with faith's fortitude, but we should rejoice in them, inasmuch as we are permitted to have fellowship in "the sufferings of Christ." He, too, suffered: sufficient then, for the disciple to be as his Master.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"When he hath tried me." Dear Christian reader, there are no exceptions. God had only one Son without sin, but never one without sorrow. Sooner or later, in one form or another, trial-sore and heavy will be our lot. "And sent Timotheus, our brother . . . to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: That no man should be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto" (1 Thess. 3:2, 3). And again it is written, "We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22). It has been so in every age. Abram was "tried," tried severely. So, too, were Joseph, Jacob. Moses, David, Daniel, the Apostles, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>3. The Ultimate Issue</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">"I shall come forth as gold." Observe the tense here. Job did not imagine that he was pure gold already. "I shall come forth as gold," he declared. He knew full well that there was yet much dross in him. He did not boast that he was already perfect. Far from it. In the final chapter of his book we find him saying, "I abhor myself" (42:6). And well he might: and well may we. As we discover that in our flesh there dwelleth "no good thing," as we examine ourselves and our ways in the light of God's Word and behold our innumerable failures, as we think of our countless sins, both of omission and commission, good reason have we for abhoring ourselves. Ah, Christian reader, there is much dross about us. But it will not ever be thus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"I shall come forth as gold." Job did not say, "When he hath tried me I may come forth as gold," or "I hope to come forth as gold," but with full confidence and positive assurance he declared, "I shall come forth as gold." But how did he know this? How can we be sure of the happy issue? Because the Divine purpose cannot fail. He which hath begun a good work in us "will finish it" (Phil. 1:6). How can we be sure of the happy issue? Because the Divine promise is sure: "The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me" (Ps. 138:8). Then be of good cheer, tried and troubled one. The process may be unpleasant and painful, but the issue is charming and sure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">"I shall come forth as gold." This was said by one who knew affliction and sorrow as few among the sons of men have known them. Yet despite his fiery trials he was optimistic. Let then this triumphant language be ours. "I shall come forth as gold" is not the language of carnal boasting, but the confidence of one whose mind was stayed upon God. There will be no credit to our account - the glory will all belong to the Divine Refiner (Jas. 1:12).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the present there remain two things: first, Love is the Divine thermometer while we are in the crucible of testing "And he shall sit (the patience of Divine grace) as a Refiner and Purifier of silver," etc. (Mal. 3:3). Second, the Lord Himself is with us in the fiery furnace, as He was with the three young Hebrews (Dan. 3:25). For the future this is sure: the most wonderful thing in heaven will not be the golden street or the golden harps, but golden souls on which is stamped the image of God "predestinate[d] to be conformed to the image of his Son!" Praise God for such a glorious prospect, such a victorious issue, such a marvelous goal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i style="text-align: justify;"><script src="https://av1611.com/verseclick/verseclick.js" type="text/javascript"></script>I have taken the liberty to change all Scripture references to the King James Bible, instead of the Revised Version which this book quoted.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>UNION AND COMMUNION</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>THOUGHTS ON THE SONG OF SOLOMON</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>By J. Hudson Taylor</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white;"><b><br /></b></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white;"><b style="text-align: justify;">Chapter Six<br />Unrestrained Communion</b></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white;"><b style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 8:5-14</b></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have now reached the closing section of this book, which, as we have seen is a poem describing the life of a believer on earth. Beginning in Section I. (Song of Songs 1:2-2:7) with the unsatisfied longings of an espoused one - longings which could only be met by her unreserved surrender to the Bridegroom of her soul - we find that when the surrender was made, instead of the cross she had so much feared she found a King, the KING of LOVE, who both satisfied her deepest longings, and found His own satisfaction in her.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The second section (Song of Songs 2:8-3:5) showed failure on her part; she was lured back again into the world, and soon found that her Beloved could not follow her there; then with full purpose of heart going forth to seek Him, and confessing His name, her search was successful, and her communion was restored.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The third section (Song of Songs 3:6-5:1) told of unbroken communion. Abiding in Christ, she was the sharer of His security and His glory. She draws the attention, however, of the daughters of Jerusalem from these outward things to her KING Himself. And, while she is thus occupied with Him, and would have others so occupied, she finds that her royal Bridegroom is delighting in her, and inviting her to fellowship of service, fearless of dens of lions and mountains of leopards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fourth section (Song of Songs 5:2-6:10), however, shows again failure; not as before through worldliness, but rather through spiritual pride and sloth. Restoration now was much more difficult; but again when she went forth diligently to seek her LORD, and so confessed Him as to lead others to long to find Him with her, He revealed Himself and the communion was restored, to be interrupted no more.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fifth section (Song of Songs 6:11-8:4), as we have seen, describes not only the mutual satisfaction and delight of the bride and Bridegroom in each other, but the recognition of her position and her beauty by the daughters of Jerusalem.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And now in the sixth section (Song of Songs 8:5-14) we come to the closing scene of the book. In it the bride is seen leaning upon her Beloved, asking Him to bind her yet more firmly to Himself, and occupying herself in His vineyard, until He calls her away from earthly service. To this last section we shall now give our attention more particularly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It opens, as did the third, by an inquiry or exclamation of the daughters of Jerusalem. There they asked, <i>"Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, etc.?"</i> but then their attention was claimed by the pomp and state of the KING, not by His person, nor by that of His bride. Here they are attracted by the happy position of the bride in relation to her Beloved, and not by their surroundings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,<br />Leaning upon her Beloved?</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is through the bride that attention is drawn to the Bridegroom; their union and communion are now open and manifest. For the last time the wilderness is mentioned; but sweetly solaced by the presence of the Bridegroom, <i>it is no wilderness to this bride</i>. In all the trustfulness of confiding love she is seen leaning upon her Beloved. He is her strength, her joy, her pride, and her prize; while she is His peculiar treasure, the object of His tenderest care. All His resources of wisdom and might are hers; though journeying she is at rest, though in the wilderness she is satisfied, while leaning upon her Beloved.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wonderful, however, as are the revelations of grace and love to the heart taught by the HOLY SPIRIT through the relationship of bride and Bridegroom, the CHRIST of GOD is more than Bridegroom to His people. He who when on earth was able to say, <i>"Before Abraham was, I am,"</i> here claims His bride from her very birth, and not alone from her espousals. Before she knew Him, He knew her; and of this He reminds her in the words:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I raised thee up under the apple tree;<br />There thy mother brought thee forth.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">He takes delight in her beauty, but that is not so much the cause as the effect of His love; for He took her up when she had no comeliness. The love that has made her what she is, and now takes delight in her, is not a fickle love, nor need she fear its change.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gladly does the bride recognize this truth, that she is indeed His own, and she exclaims:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Set me as a seal upon Thine heart, as a seal upon Thine arm:<br />For love is strong as death;<br />Jealousy</i> (ardent love) <i>is cruel</i> (retentive)<i> as the grave;<br />The coals thereof are coals of fire,<br />Which hath a most vehement flame.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The High Priest bore the names of the twelve tribes upon his heart, each name being engraved as a seal in the costly and imperishable stone chosen by God, each seal or stone being set in the purest gold; he likewise bore the same names upon his shoulders, indicating that both the love and the strength of the High Priest were pledged on behalf of the tribes of Israel. The bride would be thus upborne by Him who is alike her Prophet, Priest, and King, for love is strong as death; and jealousy, or ardent love, retentive as the grave. Not that she doubts the constancy of her Beloved, but that she has learned, alas! the inconstancy of her own heart; and she would be bound to the heart and arm of her Beloved with chains and settings of gold, ever the emblem of divinity. Thus the Psalmist prayed, <i>"Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is comparatively easy to lay the sacrifice on the altar that sanctifies the gift, but it requires divine compulsion - the cords of love - to retain it there. So here the bride would be set and fixed on the heart and on the arm of Him who is henceforth to be her all in all, that she may evermore trust only in that love, be sustained only by that power.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Do we not all need to learn a lesson from this? and to pray to be kept from turning to Egypt for help, from trusting in horses and chariots, from putting confidence in princes, or in the son of man, rather than in the living GOD? How the Kings of Israel, who had won great triumphs by faith, sometimes turned aside to heathen nations in their later years! The LORD keep His people from this snare.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bride continues: "<i>The coals thereof are coals of fire,"&nbsp;</i>a very flame of the LORD. [See Jerry's Note]&nbsp; For love of GOD, and GOD is love.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To her request the Bridegroom replies with reassuring words:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Many waters cannot quench love,<br />Neither can the floods drown it:<br />If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,<br />It would utterly be contemned.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The love which grace has begotten in the heart of the bride is itself divine and persistent; many waters cannot quench it, nor the floods drown it. Suffering and pain, bereavement and loss may test its constancy, but they will not quench it. Its source is not human or natural; like the fire, it is hidden with CHRIST in GOD. What <i>"shall separate us from the love of CHRIST? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?. . .Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in CHRIST JESUS our LORD."</i> Our love to GOD is secured by GOD'S love to us. To the soul really rescued by grace, no bribe to forsake GOD'S love will be finally successful. <i>"If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Freed from anxiety on her own account, the happy bride next asks guidance, and fellowship in service with her LORD, on behalf of those who have not yet reached her favoured position.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>We have a little sister,<br />And she hath no breasts:<br />What shall we do for our sister<br />In the day when she shall be spoken for?</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">How beautifully her conscious union with the Bridegroom appears in her expressions. <i>"We have a little sister,"</i> not I have, etc.; <i>"what shall we do for our sister,"</i> etc.? She has now no private relationships nor interests; in all things she is one with Him. And we see a further development of grace in the very question. Towards the close of the last section she recognized the Bridegroom as her Instructor. She will not now make her own plans about her little sister, and ask His acquiescence in them; she will rather learn what his thoughts are, and have fellowship with Him in His plans.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">How much anxiety and care the children of God would be spared if they learned to act in this way! Is it not too common to make the best plans that we can, and to carry them out as best we may, feeling all the while a great burden of responsibility, and earnestly asking the LORD to help us? Whereas if we always let Him be our Instructor in service, and left the responsibility with Him, our strength would not be exhausted with worry and anxiety, but would all be at His disposal, and accomplish His ends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the little sister, as yet immature, may we not see the elect of GOD, given to CHRIST in God's purpose, but not yet brought into saving relation to Him? And perhaps also those babes in CHRIST who as yet need feeding with milk and not with meat, but who, with such care, will in due time become experienced believers, fitted for the service of the LORD? Then they will be spoken for, and called into that department of service for which He has prepared them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Bridegroom replies:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>If she be a wall,<br />We will build upon her a palace of silver;<br />And if she be a door,<br />We will inclose her with boards of cedar.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this reply the Bridegroom sweetly recognizes His oneness with His bride, in the same way as she has shown her conscious oneness with Him. As she says, <i>"What shall we do for our sister?"</i> so He replies, <i>"We will build . . . we will inclose,"</i> etc. He will not carry out His purposes of grace irrespective of His bride, but will work with and through her. What can be done for this sister, however, will depend upon what she becomes. If she be a wall, built upon the true foundation, strong and stable, she shall be adorned and beautiful with battlements of silver; but if unstable and easily moved to and fro like a door, such treatment will be as impossible as unsuitable; she will need to be enclosed with boards of cedar, hedged in with restraints, for her own protection.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bride rejoicingly responds, <i>"I am a wall"</i>; she knows the foundation on which she is built, there is no "if" in her case; she is conscious of having found favour in the eyes of her Beloved. Naphtali's blessing is hers: she is <i>"satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">But what is taught by the connection of this happy consciousness with the lines which follow?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon;<br />He let out the vineyard unto keepers;<br />Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.<br />My vineyard, which is mine, is before me;<br />Thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand,<br />And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The connection is, we believe, one of great importance, teaching us that what she was (by grace) was more important than what she did; and that she did not work in order to earn favour, but being assured of favour, gave her love free scope to show itself in service. The bride knew her relationship to her LORD, and His love to her; and in her determination that He should have the thousand pieces of silver, her concern was that her vineyard should not produce less for her Solomon than His vineyard at Baal-hamon; her vineyard was herself, and she desired for her LORD much fruit. She would see, too, that the keepers of the vineyard, those who were her companions in its culture, and who ministered in word and doctrine, were well rewarded; she would not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn; a full tithe, nay a double tithe, was to be the portion of those who kept the fruit and laboured with her in the vineyard.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">How long this happy service continues, and how soon it is to be terminated, we cannot tell; He who calls His servants to dwell in the gardens, and cultivate them for Him - as Adam of old was placed in the paradise of GOD - alone knows the limit of this service. Sooner or later the rest will come, the burden and heat of the last day will have been borne, the last conflict will be over, and the voice of the Bridegroom will be heard addressing His loved one:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Thou that dwellest in the gardens,<br />The companions hearken to thy voice:<br />Cause Me to hear it.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thy service among the companions is finished; thou hast fought the good fight, thou hast kept the faith, thou hast finished thy course; henceforth there is laid up for thee the crown of righteousness, and the Bridegroom Himself shall be thine exceeding great reward!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well may the bride let Him hear her voice, and, springing forth in heart to meet Him, cry:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Make haste, my Beloved,<br />And be Thou like to a roe or to a young hart<br />Upon the mountains of spices!</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">She no longer asks Him, as in the second section:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Turn, my Beloved, and be Thou like a roe or a young hart<br />Upon the mountains of Bether</i> (separation).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">She has never again wished Him to turn away from her, for there are no mountains of Bether to those who are abiding in CHRIST; now there are mountains of spices. He who inhabits the praises of Israel, which rise, like the incense of spices, from His people's hearts, is invited by His bride to make haste, to come quickly, and be like a roe or young hart upon the mountains of spices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Very sweet is the presence of our LORD, as by His SPIRIT He dwells among His people, while they serve Him below; but here there are many thorns in every path which call for watchful care; and it is meet that now we should suffer with our LORD, in order that we may hereafter be glorified together. The day, however, is soon coming in which He will bring us up out of the earthly gardens and associations to the palace of the great KING. There His people <i>"shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the LAMB, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and GOD shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The SPIRIT and the bride say, Come!. . .<br />Surely I come quickly.<br />Amen; even so, come, LORD JESUS!</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>APPENDIX</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Daughters of Jerusalem</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The question is frequently asked, Who are represented by the daughters of Jerusalem?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">They are clearly not the bride, yet they are not far removed from her. They know where the Bridegroom makes His flock to rest at noon; they are charged by the Bridegroom not to stir up nor awaken His love when she rests, abiding in Him; they draw attention to the Bridegroom as with dignity and pomp He comes up from the wilderness; their love-gifts adorn His chariot of state; they are appealed to by the bride for help in finding her Beloved, and, stirred by her impassioned description of His beauty, they desire to seek Him with her; they describe very fully the beauty of the bride, but, on the other hand, we never find them occupied with the person of the Bridegroom; He is not all in all to them; they mind outward and earthly things.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Do they not represent those who, if not actually saved, are very near it; or, if saved, are only half-saved? who are for the present more concerned about the things of this world than the things of GOD? To advance their own interests, to secure their own comfort, concerns them more than to be in all things pleasing to the LORD. They may form part of that great company spoken of in Rev. 7:9-17, who come out of the great tribulation, but they will not form part of the 144,000, the <i>"firstfruits unto GOD and to the LAMB"</i> (Rev. 14:1-5). They have forgotten the warning of our LORD in Luke 21:34-36; and hence they are not <i>"accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the SON of Man."</i> They have not, with Paul, counted <i>"all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of CHRIST JESUS my LORD,"</i> and hence they do not <i>"attain unto"</i> that resurrection from among the dead, which Paul felt he might miss, but aimed to attain unto.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="text-align: justify;"></span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We wish to place on record our solemn conviction that not all who are Christians, or think themselves to be such, will attain to that resurrection of which St Paul speaks in Phil. 3:11, or will thus meet the LORD in the air. Unto those who by lives of consecration manifest that they are not of the world, but are looking for Him, He will appear <i>"without sin unto salvation."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i><br /></i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[Jerry's Note] Here Hudson Taylor goes on to say: "It is worthy to note that this is the only occurrence of this word "LORD" in this book. But how could it be omitted here?" The word "LORD" is not used at all in the Song of Solomon in the King James Bible. Taylor referred various times to readings in the Revised Version, and must also be referring to another change in that version here as well. Of course, we do not accept any changes or corrections to God's preserved Word, here or elsewhere.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://faithfulmenofgod.blogspot.com/2009/10/union-and-communion-song-of-solomon-by.html" target="_blank">Back to Union And Communion - Introduction</a></b></p>

<p><i style="text-align: justify;">I have taken the liberty to change all Scripture references to the King James Bible, instead of the Revised Version which this book quoted.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>UNION AND COMMUNION</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>THOUGHTS ON THE SONG OF SOLOMON</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>By J. Hudson Taylor</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter Five<br />Fruits Of Recognized Union</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Song of Solomon 6:11-8:4</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second and fourth sections of this book we found the communion of the bride broken; in the former by backsliding into worldliness, and in the latter through slothful ease and self-satisfaction. The present section, like the third, is one of unbroken communion. It is opened by the words of the bride:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I went down into the garden of nuts<br />To see the fruits of the valley,<br />And to see whether the vine flourished,<br />And the pomegranates budded.<br />Or ever I was aware, my soul made me<br />Like the chariots of Amminadib</i> (my willing people).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As in the commencement of Section III., the bride, in unbroken communion with her LORD, was present though unmentioned until she made her presence evident by her address to the daughters of Zion; so in this section the presence of the KING is unnoted until He Himself addresses His bride. But she is one with her LORD as she engages in His service! His promise, <i>"Lo, I am with you alway,"</i> is ever fulfilled to her; and He has no more to woo her to arise and come away; to tell her that His <i>"head is filled with dew,"</i> His <i>"locks with the drops of the night"</i>; or to urge her if she love Him to feed His sheep and care for His lambs. Herself His garden, she does not forget to tend it, nor keep the vineyards of others while her own is neglected. <i>With </i>Him as well as <i>for </i>Him, she goes to the garden of nuts. So thorough is the union between them that many commentators have felt difficulty in deciding whether the bride or the Bridegroom was the speaker, and really it is a point of little moment; for, as we have said, both were there, and of one mind; yet we believe we are right in attributing these words to the bride, as she is the one addressed by the daughters of Jerusalem, and the one who speaks to them in reply.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bride and Bridegroom appear to have been discovered by their willing people while thus engaged in the happy fellowship of fruitful service, and the bride, or ever she was aware, found herself seated among the chariots of her people - <i>her </i>people as well as <i>His</i>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The daughters of Jerusalem would fain call her back:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Return, return, O Shulamite;<br />Return, return, that we may look upon thee.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no question now as to who she is, nor why her Beloved is more than another beloved; He is recognized as King Solomon, and to her is given the same name, only in its feminine form (Shulamite).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some have seen in these words, <i>"Return, return,"</i> an indication of the rapture of the Church; and explain some parts of the subsequent context, which appear inconsistent with this view, as presumptive rather than progressive. Interesting as is this thought, and well as it would explain the absence of <i>reference </i>to the KING in the preceding verses, we are not inclined to accept it; but look on the whole song as progressive, and its last words as being equivalent to the closing words of the Book of Revelation, <i>"Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, LORD JESUS."</i> We do not therefore look upon the departure of the bride from her garden as being other than temporary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bride replies to the daughters of Jerusalem:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>What will ye see in the Shulamite?</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the presence of the KING, she cannot conceive why any attention should be paid to her. As Moses, coming down from the mount, was unconscious that his face shone with a divine glory, so was it here with the bride. But we may learn this very important lesson, that many who do not see the beauty of the LORD, will not fail to admire His reflected beauty in His bride. The eager look of the daughters of Jerusalem surprised the bride, and she says, You might be looking "upon the dance of Mahanaim" - the dance of two companies of Israel's fairest daughters - instead of upon one who has no claim for attention, save that she is the chosen, though unworthy, bride of the glorious KING.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The daughters of Jerusalem have no difficulty in replying to her question, and recognizing her as of royal birth -&nbsp;<i>"O Prince's daughter"</i> - as well as of queenly dignity, they describe in true and Oriental language the tenfold beauties of her person; from her feet to her head they see only beauty and perfection. What a contrast to her state by nature! Once <i>"from the sole of the foot even unto the head"</i> was <i>"but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores"</i>; now her feet are <i>"shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace,"</i> and the very hair of the head proclaims her a Nazarite indeed; <i>"the KING"</i> Himself <i>"is held in the galleries."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">But One, more to her than the daughters of Jerusalem, responded to her unaffected question, <i>"What will ye see in the Shulamite?"</i> The Bridegroom Himself replies to it:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>How fair and how pleasant art thou,<br />O love, for delights!</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">He sees in her the beauties and the fruitfulness of the tall and upright palm, of the graceful and clinging vine, of the fragrant and evergreen citron. Grace has made her like the palm-tree, the emblem alike of uprightness and of fruitfulness. The fruit of the date-palm is more valued than bread by the Oriental traveller, so great is its sustaining power; and the fruit-bearing powers of the tree do not pass away; as age increases the fruit becomes more perfect as well as more abundant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree:<br />He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.<br />Those that be planted in the house of the LORD<br />Shall flourish in the courts of our God.<br />They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;<br />They shall be fat and flourishing.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">But why are the righteous made so upright and flourishing?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>To shew that the Lord is upright;<br />He is my Rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">One with our LORD, it is ours to <i>show forth</i> His graces and virtues, to reflect His beauty, to be His faithful witnesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The palm is also the emblem of victory; it raises its beautiful crown towards the heavens, fearless of the heat of the sultry sun, or of the burning hot wind from the desert. From its beauty it was one of the ornaments of Solomon's, as it is to be of Ezekiel's temple. When our SAVIOUR was received at Jerusalem as the KING of Israel the people took branches of palm-trees and went forth to meet Him; and in the glorious day of His espousals, <i>"a great multitude, which no man"</i> can <i>"number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,"</i> shall stand<i> "before the throne, and before the LAMB, clothed with white robes"</i>; and with palms of victory in their hands shall ascribe their <i>"salvation to our GOD which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the LAMB."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">But if she resembles the palm she also resembles the vine. Much she needs the culture of the Husbandman, and well does she repay it. Abiding in CHRIST, the true source of fruitfulness, she brings forth clusters of grapes, luscious and refreshing, as well as sustaining, like the fruit of the palm - luscious and refreshing to Himself, the owner of the vineyard, as well as to the weary, thirsty world in which He has placed it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The vine has its own suggestive lessons: it needs and seeks support; the sharp knife of the pruner often cuts away unsparingly its tender garlands, and mars its appearance, while increasing its fruitfulness. It has been beautifully written:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The living Vine, Christ chose it for Himself:--<br />God gave to man for use and sustenance<br />Corn, wine, and oil, and each of these is good:<br />And Christ is Bread of life and Light of life.<br />But yet, He did not choose the summer corn,<br />That shoots up straight and free in one quick growth,<br />And has its day, is done, and springs no more;<br />Nor yet the olive, all whose boughs are spread<br />In the soft air, and never lose a leaf,<br />Flowering and fruitful in perpetual peace;<br />But only this, for Him and His is one,--<br />That everlasting, ever-quickening Vine,<br />That gives the heat and passion of the world,<br />Through its own life-blood, still renewed and shed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The Vine from every living limb bleeds wine;<br />Is it the poorer for that spirit shed?<br />The drunkard and the wanton drink thereof;<br />Are they the richer for that gift's excess?<br />Measure thy life by loss instead of gain;<br />Not by the wine drunk, but the wine poured forth;<br />For love's strength standeth in love's sacrifice;<br />And whoso suffers most, hath most to give.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yet one figure more is used by the Bridegroom: <i>"The smell of thy"</i> breath is <i>"like apples,"</i> or rather citrons. In the first section the bride exclaims:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,<br />So is my Beloved among the sons.<br />I sat down under His shadow with great delight,<br />And His fruit was sweet to my taste.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here we find the outcome of that communion. The citrons on which she had fed perfumed her breath, and imparted to her their delicious odour. The Bridegroom concludes his description:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Thy... mouth</i> (is) <i>like the best wine,<br />For my Beloved,<br />That goeth down sweetly</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">- interjects the bride,</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">How wondrous the grace that has made the bride of CHRIST to be all this to her Beloved! Upright as the palm, victorious, and evermore fruitful as she grows heavenward; gentle and tender as the Vine, self-forgetful and self-sacrificing, not merely bearing fruit in spite of adversity, but bearing her richest fruits through it; - feasting on her Beloved, as she rests beneath His shade, and thereby partaking of His fragrance; - what has grace not done for her! And what must be her joy in finding, ever more fully, the satisfaction of the glorious Bridegroom in the lowly wild flower He has made His bride, and beautiful with His own graces and virtues!</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I am my Beloved's,<br />And His desire is toward me,</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">she gladly exclaims. Now it is none of self or for self, but all of Thee and for Thee. And if such be the sweet fruits of going down to the garden of nuts, and caring for His garden with Him, she will need no constraining to continue in this blessed service.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Come, my Beloved, let us go forth into the field;<br />Let us lodge in the villages.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">She is not ashamed of her lowly origin, for she fears no shame: perfect love has cast out fear. The royal state of the King, with its pomp and grandeur, may be enjoyed by and by: now, more sweet with Him at her side to make the garden fruitful; to give to Him all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which she has laid up in store for Him; and best of all to satisfy Him with her own love. Not only is she contented with this fellowship of service, but she could fain wish that there were no honours and duties to claim His attention, and for the moment to lessen the joy of His presence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Oh that Thou wert as my brother,<br />That sucked the breasts of my mother!<br />When I should find Thee without, I would kiss Thee;<br />Yea, and I should not be despised.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Would that she could care for Him, and claim His whole attention, as a sister might care for a brother. She is deeply conscious that He has richly endowed her, and that she is as nothing compared with Him; but instead of proudly dwelling upon what she has done through Him, she would fain that it were possible for her to be the giver and Him the receiver. Far removed is this from the grudging thought, that must so grate upon the heart of our LORD, "I do not think that GOD requires this of me"; or, "Must I give up that, if I am to be a Christian?" True devotion will rather ask to be allowed to give, and will count as loss all which may not be given up for the LORD'S sake - <i>"I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of CHRIST JESUS my LORD."</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This longing desire to be more to Him does not, however, blind her to the consciousness that she needs His guidance, and that He is her true, her only Instructor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I would lead Thee, and bring Thee into my mother's house,</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">That Thou mightest&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>instruct me...<br />I would cause Thee to drink of spiced wine,<br />Of the juice of my pomegranate.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">I would give Thee my best, and yet would myself seek all my rest and satisfaction in Thee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>His left hand should be under my head,<br />And His right hand should embrace me.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">And thus the section closes. There is nothing sweeter to the Bridegroom or to the bride than this hallowed and unhindered communion; and again He adjures the daughters of Jerusalem, in slightly different form:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>That ye stir not up, nor awake My love,<br />Until He</i> (fn. 5) <i>please.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hallowed communion indeed! May we ever enjoy it; and abiding in CHRIST, we shall sing, in the familiar words of the well-known hymn--</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Both Thine arms are clasped around me,<br />And my head is on Thy breast;<br />And my weary soul hath found Thee<br />Such a perfect, perfect rest!<br />Blessed Jesus,<br />Now I know that I am blest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>[Footnote 5]&nbsp;</b>Hudson Taylor&#8217;s Footnote (which we disagree with): The pronoun here should not be "he" as A. V., nor "it" as R.V., but "she".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://faithfulmenofgod.blogspot.com/2024/04/union-and-communion-chapter-six.html" target="_blank">Union And Communion - Chapter Six</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://faithfulmenofgod.blogspot.com/2009/10/union-and-communion-song-of-solomon-by.html" target="_blank">Back to Union And Communion - Introduction</a></b></p>

<p><i style="text-align: justify;">I have taken the liberty to change all Scripture references to the King James Bible, instead of the Revised Version which this book quoted.</i></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>UNION AND COMMUNION</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>THOUGHTS ON THE SONG OF SOLOMON</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>by J. Hudson Taylor</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter Four<br />Communion Again Broken - Restoration</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Song of Solomon 5:2-6:10</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fourth section commences with an address of the bride to the daughters of Jerusalem, in which she narrates her recent sad experience, and entreats their help in her trouble. The presence and comfort of her Bridegroom are again lost to her; not this time by relapse into worldliness, but by slothful self-indulgence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We are not told of the steps that led to her failure; of how self again found place in her heart. Perhaps spiritual pride in the achievements which grace enabled her to accomplish was the cause; or, not improbably, a cherished satisfaction in the blessing she had received, instead of in the Blesser Himself, may have led to the separation. She seems to have been largely unconscious of her declination; self-occupied and self-contented, she scarcely noticed His absence; she was resting, resting alone, --never asking where He had gone, or how He was employed. And more than this, the door of her chamber was not only closed, but barred; an evidence that His return was neither eagerly desired nor expected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yet her heart was not far from Him; there was a music in His voice that awakened echoes in her soul such as no other voice could have stirred. She was still "<i>a spring shut up, a fountain sealed</i>," so far as the world was concerned. The snare this time was the more dangerous and insidious because it was quite unsuspected. Let us look at her narrative:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I sleep, but my heart waketh:<br />It is the voice of my Beloved that knocketh, saying,<br />Open to Me, My sister, My love, My dove, My undefiled:<br />For My head is filled with dew,<br />And My locks with the drops of the night.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">How often the position of the Bridegroom is that of a knocking Suitor outside, as in His epistle to the Laodicean (fn. 4) Church: <i>"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me."</i> It is sad that He should be outside a closed door - that He should need to knock; but still more sad that He should knock, and knock in vain at the door of any heart which has become His own. In this case it is not the position of the bride that is wrong; if it were, His word as before would be, <i>"Arise, and come away"</i>; whereas now His word is, <i>"Open to Me, My sister, My love."</i> It was her <i>condition </i>of self-satisfaction and love of ease that closed the door.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Very touching are His words: <i>"Open to Me, My sister"</i> (He is the first-born among many brethren), <i>"My love"</i> (the object of My heart's devotion), <i>"My dove"</i> (one who has been endued with many of the gifts and graces of the HOLY SPIRIT), <i>"My undefiled"</i> (washed, renewed, and cleansed for Me); and He urges her to open by reference to His own condition:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>For My head is filled with dew,<br />And My locks with the drops of the night.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Why is it that His head is filled with the dew? Because His heart is a shepherd-heart. There are those whom the FATHER has given to Him who are wandering on the dark mountains of sin: many, oh, how many, have never heard the SHEPHERD'S voice; many, too, who were once in the fold have wandered away - far away from its safe shelter. The heart that never can forget, the love that never can fall, must seek the wandering sheep until the lost one has been found: <i>"My FATHER worketh hitherto, and I work."</i> And will she, who so recently was at His side, who joyfully braved the dens of lions and the mountains of leopards, will she leave Him to seek alone the wandering and the lost?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Open to Me, My sister, My love, My dove, My undefiled:<br />For My head is filled with dew,<br />And My locks with the drops of the night.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We do not know a more touching entreaty in the Word of GOD, and sad indeed is the reply of the bride:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?<br />I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">How sadly possible it is to take delight in conferences and conventions, to feast on all the good things that are brought before us, and yet to be unprepared to go out from them to self-denying efforts to rescue the perishing; to delight in the rest of faith while forgetful to fight the good fight of faith; to dwell upon the cleansing and the purity effected by faith, but to have little thought for the poor souls struggling in the mire of sin. If we can put off our coat when He would have us keep it on; if we can wash our feet while He is wandering alone upon the mountains, is there not sad want of fellowship with our LORD?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meeting with no response from the tardy bride, her</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Beloved put in His hand by the hole of the door,<br />And</i> "her" <i>bowels were moved for Him.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">But, alas, the door was not only latched, but barred; and His effort to secure an entrance was in vain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I rose up to open to my Beloved;<br />And my hands dropped with myrrh,<br />And my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh,<br />Upon the handles of the lock.<br />I opened to my Beloved;<br />But my Beloved had withdrawn Himself, and was gone.<br />My soul failed me when He spake;</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When, all too late, the bride did arise, she seems to have been more concerned to anoint herself with the liquid myrrh than to speedily welcome her waiting LORD; more occupied with her own graces than with His desire. No words of welcome were uttered, though her heart failed within her; and the grieved One had withdrawn Himself before she was ready to receive Him. Again (as in the third chapter) she had to go forth alone to seek her LORD; and this time her experiences were much more painful than on the former occasion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I sought Him, but I could not find Him;<br />I called Him, but He gave me no answer.<br />The watchmen that went about the city found me,<br />They smote me, they wounded me;<br />The keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Her first relapse had been one of inexperience; if a second relapse had been brought about by inadvertence she should at least have been ready and prompt when summoned to obey. It is not a little thing to fall into the habit of being tardy in obedience, even in the case of a believer: in the case of the unbeliever the final issue of disobedience is inexpressibly awful:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Turn you at My reproof:<br />Behold, I will pour out My Spirit unto you,<br />I will make known My words unto you.<br />Because I have called, and ye refused;<br />I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded;. . .<br />I also will laugh at your calamity. . .<br />Then shall they call upon Me, but will I not answer;<br />They shall seek Me early, but they shall not find Me.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The backsliding of the bride, though painful, was not final; for it was followed by true repentance. She went forth into the darkness and sought Him; she called, but He responded not, and the watchmen finding her, both smote and wounded her. They appear to have appreciated the gravity of her declination more correctly than she had done. Believers may be blinded to their own inconsistencies; others, however, note them; and the higher the position with regard to our LORD the more surely will any failure be visited with reproach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wounded, dishonoured, unsuccessful in her search, and almost in despair, the bride turns to the daughters of Jerusalem; and recounting the story of her sorrows, adjures <i>them </i>to tell her Beloved that she is not unfaithful or unmindful of Him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my Beloved,<br />That ye tell Him, that I am sick of love.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The reply of the daughters of Jerusalem shows very clearly that the sorrow-stricken bride, wandering in the dark, is not recognized as the bride of the KING, though her personal beauty does not escape notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>What is thy Beloved more than another beloved,<br />O thou fairest among women?<br />What is thy Beloved more than another beloved,<br />That thou dost so charge us?</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This question, implying that her Beloved was no more than any other, stirs her soul to its deepest depths; and, forgetting herself, she pours out from the fulness of her heart a soul-ravishing description of the glory and beauty of her LORD.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>My Beloved is white and ruddy,<br />The chiefest among ten thousand.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(see verses 10-16, concluding with)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>His mouth is most sweet; yea, He is altogether lovely.<br />This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend,<br />O daughters of Jerusalem.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is interesting to compare the bride's description of the Bridegroom with the descriptions of <i>"the Ancient of Days"</i> in Dan. 7:9, 10, and of our risen LORD in Rev. 1:13-16. The differences are very characteristic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Dan. 7 we see the Ancient of Days seated on the throne of judgment; His garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool; His throne and His wheels were as burning fire, and a fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him. The Son of Man was brought near before Him, and received from Him dominion, and glory, and an everlasting kingdom that shall not be destroyed. In Rev. 1 we see the Son of Man Himself clothed with a garment down to the foot, and His head and His hair were white as wool, white as snow; but the bride sees her Bridegroom in all the vigour of youth, with locks <i>"bushy, and black as a raven."</i> The eyes of the risen SAVIOUR are described as <i>"a flame of fire,"</i> but His bride sees them <i>"doves by the rivers of waters."</i> In Revelation <i>"His voice as the sound of many waters. . .and out of His mouth went a sharp twoedged sword."</i> To the bride, His lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh, and His mouth most sweet. The countenance of the risen SAVIOUR was <i>"as the sun shineth in his strength,"</i> and the effect of the vision on John - <i>"when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead"</i><b> -&nbsp;</b>was not unlike the effect of the vision given to Saul as he neared Damascus. But to His bride <i>"His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars."</i> The LION of the tribe of Judah is to His own bride the KING of love; and, with full heart and beaming face, she so recounts His beauties that the daughters of Jerusalem are seized with strong desire to seek Him with her, that they also may behold His beauty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Whither is thy Beloved gone,<br />O thou fairest among women?<br />Whither is thy Beloved turned aside?<br />That we may seek Him with thee?</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bride replies:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>My Beloved is gone down into His garden, to the beds of spices,<br />To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.<br />I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine:<br />He feedeth among the lilies.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Forlorn and desolate as she might appear she still knows herself as the object of His affections, and claims Him as her own. This expression, <i>"I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine,"</i> is similar to that found in the second chapter, <i>"My Beloved is mine, and I am His"</i>; and yet with noteworthy difference. Then her first thought of CHRIST was of her claim upon Him: His claim upon her was secondary. Now she thinks first of His claim; and only afterwards mentions her own. We see a still further development of grace in chapter 7:10, where the bride, losing sight of her claim altogether, says:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I am my Beloved's,<br />And His desire is toward me.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">No sooner has she uttered these words and acknowledged herself as His rightful possession - a claim which she had practically repudiated when she kept Him barred out - than her Bridegroom Himself appears; and with no upbraiding word, but in tenderest love, tells her how beautiful she is in His eyes, and speaks her praise to the daughters of Jerusalem.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To her, He says:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Thou art beautiful, O My love, as Tirzah,</i><br />(the beautiful city of Samaria,)<br /><i>Comely as Jerusalem,</i><br />(the glorious city of the great King,)<br /><i>Terrible</i> (or rather brilliant) <i>as an army with banners.<br />Turn away thine eyes from Me,<br />For they have overcome Me</i>. (See vv. 4-7).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Then, turning to the daughters of Jerusalem, He exclaims:--</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines,<br />And virgins without number.<br />My dove, My undefiled is but one;<br />She is the only one of her mother;<br />She is the choice one of her that bare her.<br />The daughters saw her, and blessed her;<br />Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her,</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">saying,</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,<br />Fair as the moon,<br />Clear as the sun,<br />And terrible as an army with banners?</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: white;"></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus the section closes with communion fully restored; the bride reinstated and openly acknowledged by the Bridegroom as His own peerless companion and friend. The painful experience through which the bride has passed has been fraught with lasting good, and we have no further indication of interrupted communion, but in the remaining sections only joy and fruitfulness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>[Footnote 4]</b>&nbsp;The Church of Popular Opinion, as pointed out by the Rev. Charles Fox in an address at Keswick, as the Church of Philadelphia is the Church of Brotherly Love.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://faithfulmenofgod.blogspot.com/2024/04/union-and-communion-chapter-five.html" target="_blank">Union And Communion - Chapter Five</a></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://faithfulmenofgod.blogspot.com/2009/10/union-and-communion-song-of-solomon-by.html" target="_blank">Back to Union And Communion - Introduction</a></b></p>

The outline of it is taken from one who will never complain of me, for to the great loss of the Church she has left these lower choirs to sing above. Miss Havergal, last and loveliest of our modern poets, when her tones were most mellow, and her language most sublime, has been caught up to swell the music of heaven. Her last poems are published with the title, &#8220;Under His Shadow,&#8221; and the preface gives the reason for the name. She said, &#8220;I should like the title to be, &#8216;Under His Shadow.&#8217; I seem to see four pictures suggested by that: under the shadow of a rock, in a weary plain; under the shadow of a tree; closer still, under the shadow of His wing; nearest and closest, in the shadow of His hand. Surely that hand must be the pierced hand, that may oftentimes press us sorely, and yet evermore encircling, upholding, and shadowing.&#8221;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Under His Shadow,&#8221; is our afternoon subject, and we will in a few words enlarge on the Scriptural plan which Miss Havergal has bequeathed to us. Our text is, <i>&#8220;He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide <b>under the shadow</b> of the Almighty.&#8221;</i> The shadow of God is not the occasional resort, but the constant abiding-place, of the saint. Here we find not only our consolation, but our habitation. We ought never to be out of the shadow of God. It is to dwellers, not to visitors, that the Lord promises His protection. <i>&#8220;He that <b>dwelleth </b>in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty:&#8221;</i> and that shadow shall preserve him from nightly terror and ghostly ill, from the arrows of war and of pestilence, from death and from destruction. Guarded by Omnipotence, the chosen of the Lord are always safe; for as they dwell in the holy place, hard by the mercy-seat, where the blood was sprinkled of old, the pillar of fire by night, the pillar of cloud by day, which ever hangs over the sanctuary, covers them also. Is it not written, <i>&#8220;In the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion, in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me&#8221;</i>? What better security can we desire? As the people of God, we are always under the protection of the Most High. Wherever we go, whatever we suffer, whatever may be our difficulties, temptations, trials, or perplexities, we are always <i>&#8220;under the shadow of the Almighty.&#8221;</i> Over all who maintain their fellowship with God the most tender guardian care is extended. Their heavenly Father Himself interposes between them and their adversaries. The experience of the saints, albeit they are all under the shadow, yet differs as to the form in which that protection has been enjoyed by them, hence the value of the four figures which will now engage our attention.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>I. We will begin with the first picture which Miss Havergal mentions, namely, the rock sheltering the weary traveller:</b> <i>&#8220;The shadow of a great rock in a weary land&#8221;</i> (Isaiah 32:2).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Now, I take it that this is where we begin to know our Lord&#8217;s shadow. He was at the first to us <i>a refuge in time of trouble</i>. Weary was the way, and great was the heat; our lips were parched, and our souls were fainting; we sought for shelter, and we found none; for we were in the wilderness of sin and condemnation, and who could bring us deliverance, or even hope? Then we cried unto the Lord in our trouble, and He led us to the Rock of ages, which of old was cleft for us. We saw our interposing Mediator coming between us and the fierce heat of justice, and we hailed the blessed screen. The Lord Jesus was unto us a covering for sin, and so a covert from wrath. The sense of divine displeasure, which had beaten upon our conscience, was removed by the removal of the sin itself, which we saw to be laid on Jesus, who in our place and stead endured its penalty.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The shadow of a rock is remarkably cooling, and so was the Lord Jesus eminently comforting to us. The shadow of a rock is more dense, more complete, and more cool than any other shade; and so the peace which Jesus gives passeth all understanding, there is none like it. No chance beam darts through the rock-shade, nor can the heat penetrate as it will do in a measure through the foliage of a forest. Jesus is a complete shelter, and blessed are they who are <i>&#8220;under His shadow.&#8221;</i> Let them take care that they abide there, and never venture forth to answer for themselves, or to brave the accusations of Satan.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As with sin, so with sorrow of every sort: the Lord is the Rock of our refuge. No sun shall smite us, nor, any heat, because we are never out of Christ. The saints know where to fly, and they use their privilege.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">&#8220;When troubles, like a burning sun,</div><div style="text-align: center;">Beat heavy on their head,</div><div style="text-align: center;">To Christ their mighty Rock they run,</div><div style="text-align: center;">And find a pleasing shade.&#8221;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is, however, something of awe about this great shadow. A rock is often so high as to be terrible, and we tremble in presence of its greatness. The idea of littleness hiding behind massive greatness is well set forth; but there is no tender thought of fellowship, or gentleness: even so, at the first, we view the Lord Jesus as our shelter from the consuming heat of well-deserved punishment, and we know little more. It is most pleasant to remember that this is only one panel of the four-fold picture. Inexpressibly dear to my soul is the deep cool rock-shade of my blessed Lord, as I stand in Him a sinner saved; yet is there more.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>II. Our second picture, that of the tree, is to be found in the Song of Solomon 2:3:</b> <i>&#8220;As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my Beloved among the sons. I sat down under His shadow with great delight, and His fruit was sweet to my taste.&#8221;</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here we have not so much refuge from trouble as special <i>rest in times of joy</i>. The spouse is happily wandering through a wood, glancing at many trees, and rejoicing in the music of the birds. One tree specially charms her: the citron with its golden fruit wins her admiration, and she sits under its shadow with great delight; such was her Beloved to her, the best among the good, the fairest of the fair, the joy of her joy, the light of her delight. Such is Jesus to the believing soul.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The sweet influences of Christ are intended to give us a happy rest, and we ought to avail ourselves of them; <i>&#8220;I sat down under His shadow.&#8221;</i> This was Mary&#8217;s better part, which Martha well-nigh missed by being cumbered. That is the good old way wherein we are to walk, the way in which we find rest unto our souls. Papists and papistical persons, whose religion is all ceremonies, or all working, or all groaning, or all feeling, have never come to an end. We may say of their religion as of the law, that it made nothing perfect; but under the gospel there is something finished, and that something is the sum and substance of our salvation, and therefore there is rest for us, and we ought to sing, <i>&#8220;I sat down.&#8221;</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Dear friends, is Christ to each one of us a place of sitting down? I do not mean a rest of idleness and self-content, - God deliver us from that; but there is rest in a conscious grasp of Christ, a rest of contentment with Him as our all in all. God give us to know more of this! This shadow is also meant to yield perpetual solace, for the spouse did not merely come under it, but there she sat down as one who meant to stay. Continuance of repose and joy is purchased for us by our Lord&#8217;s perfected work. Under the shadow she found food; she had no need to leave it to find a single needful thing, for the tree which shaded also yielded fruit; nor did she need even to rise from her rest, but sitting still she feasted on the delicious fruit. You who know the Lord Jesus know also what this meaneth.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The spouse never wished to go beyond her Lord. She knew no higher life than that of sitting under the Well-beloved&#8217;s shadow. She passed the cedar, and oak, and every other goodly tree, but the apple-tree held her, and there she sat down. &#8220;Many there be that say, who will show us any good? But as for us, O Lord, our heart is fixed, our heart is fixed, resting on Thee. We will go no further, for Thou art our dwelling-place, we feel at home with Thee, and sit down beneath Thy shadow.&#8221; Some Christians cultivate reverence at the expense of childlike love; they kneel down, but they dare not sit down. Our Divine Friend and Lover wills not that it should be so; He would not have us stand on ceremony with Him, but come boldly unto Him.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Let us be simple with Him, then,</div><div style="text-align: center;">Not backward, stiff or cold,</div><div style="text-align: center;">As though our Bethlehem could be</div><div style="text-align: center;">What Sinai was of old.&#8221;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Let us use His sacred name as a common word, as a household word, and run to Him as to a dear familiar friend. Under His shadow we are to feel that we are at home, and then He will make Himself at home to us by becoming food unto our souls, and giving spiritual refreshment to us while we rest. The spouse does not here say that she reached up to the tree to gather its fruit, but she sat down on the ground in intense delight, and the fruit came to her where she sat. It is wonderful how Christ will come down to souls that sit beneath His shadow; if we can but be at home with Christ, He will sweetly commune with us. Has He not said,<i> &#8220;Delight thyself also in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart&#8221;?</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In this second form of the sacred shadow, the sense of awe gives place to that of restful delight in Christ. Have you ever figured in such a scene as the sitter beneath the grateful shade of the fruitful tree? Have you not only possessed security, but experienced delight in Christ? Have you sung,</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I sat down under His shadow,</div><div style="text-align: center;">Sat down with great delight;</div><div style="text-align: center;">His fruit was sweet unto my taste,</div><div style="text-align: center;">And pleasant to my sight&#8221;?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is as necessary an experience as it is joyful: necessary for many uses. The joy of the Lord is our strength, and it is when we delight ourselves in the Lord that we have assurance of power in prayer. Here faith develops, and hope grows bright, while love sheds abroad all the fragrance of her sweet spices. Oh! get you to the apple-tree, and find out who is the fairest among the fair. Make the Light of heaven the delight of your heart, and then be filled with heart&#8217;s-ease, and revel in complete content.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>III. The third view of the one subject is, - the shadow of his wings, - a precious word.</b> I think the best specimen of it, for it occurs several times, is in that blessed Psalm, the sixty-third, verse seven: <i>&#8220;Because Thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of Thy wings will I rejoice.&#8221;</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Does not this set forth our Lord as <i>our trust in hours of depression</i>? In the Psalm now open before us, David was banished from the means of grace to a dry and thirsty land, where no water was. What is much worse, he was in a measure away from all conscious enjoyment of God. He says, <i>&#8220;Early will I seek Thee. My soul thirsteth for Thee.&#8221;</i> He sings rather of memories than of present communion with God. We also have come into this condition, and have been unable to find any present comfort. <i>&#8220;Thou hast been my help,&#8221;</i> has been the highest note we could strike, and we have been glad to reach to that. At such times, the light of God&#8217;s face has been withdrawn, but our faith has taught us to rejoice under the shadow of His wings. Light there was none; we were altogether in the shade, but it was a warm shade. We felt that God who had been near must be near us still, and therefore we were quieted. Our God cannot change, and therefore as He was our help He must still be our help, our help even though He casts a shadow over us, for it must be the shadow of His own eternal wings. The metaphor is, of course, derived from the nestling of little birds under the shadow of their mother&#8217;s wings, and the picture is singularly touching and comforting. The little bird is not yet able to take care of itself, so it cowers down under the mother, and is there happy and safe. Disturb a hen for a moment, and you will see all the little chickens huddling together, and by their chirps making a kind of song. Then they push their heads into her feathers, and seem happy beyond measure in their warm abode. When we are very sick and sore depressed, when we are worried with the care of pining children, and the troubles of a needy household, and the temptations of Satan, how comforting it is to run to our God, - like the little chicks run to the hen, - and hide away near His heart, beneath His Wings. Oh, tried ones, press closely to the loving heart of your Lord, hide yourselves entirely beneath His wings! Here awe has disappeared, and rest itself is enhanced by the idea of loving trust. The little birds are safe in their mother&#8217;s love, and we, too, are beyond measure secure and happy in the loving favour of the Lord.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>IV. The last form of the shadow is that of the hand, and this, it seems to me, points to power and position in service</b>. Turn to Isaiah 49:2:&nbsp;<i>&#8220;And He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His hand hath He hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in His quiver hath He hid me.&#8221;</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This undoubtedly refers to the Saviour, for the passage proceeds: - <i>&#8220;And said unto Me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent My strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely My judgment is with the Lord, and My work with My God. And now, saith the Lord that formed Me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and My God shall be My strength. And He said, It is a light thing that Thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth.&#8221;</i> Our Lord Jesus Christ was hidden away in the hand of Jehovah, to be used by Him as a polished shaft for the overthrow of His enemies, and the victory of His people. Yet, inasmuch as it is Christ, it is also all Christ&#8217;s servants, since as He is so are we also in this world; and to make quite sure of it, we have the same expression in the sixteenth verse of the fifty-first chapter, where, speaking of His people, He says, <i>&#8220;I have covered thee in the shadow of Mine hand.&#8221;</i> Is not this an excellent minister&#8217;s text? Every one of you who will speak a word for Jesus shall have a share in it. This is where those who are workers for Christ should long to be, - &#8220;in the shadow of His hand,&#8221; to achieve His eternal purpose. What are any of God&#8217;s servants without their Lord but weapons out of the warrior&#8217;s hand, having no power to do anything? We ought to be as the arrows of the Lord which He shoots at His enemies; and so great is His hand of power, and so little are we as His instruments, that He hides us away in the hollow of His hand, unseen until He darts us forth. As workers, we are to be hidden away in the hand of God, or to quote the other figure, <i>&#8220;in His quiver hath He hid me:&#8221;</i> we are to be unseen till He uses us. It is impossible for us not to be known somewhat if the Lord uses us, but we may not aim at being noticed, but, on the contrary, if we be as much used as the very chief of the apostles, we must truthfully add, &#8220;though I be nothing.&#8221; Our desire should be that Christ should be glorified, and that self should be concealed. Alas! there is a way of always showing self in what we do, and we are all too ready to fall into it. You can visit the poor in such a way that they will feel that his lordship or her ladyship has condescended to call upon poor Betsy; but there is another way of doing the same thing so that the tried child of God shall know that a brother beloved or a dear sister in Christ has shown a fellow-feeling for her, and has talked to her heart. There is a way of preaching, in which a great divine has evidently displayed his vast learning and talent; and there is another way of preaching, in which a faithful servant of Jesus Christ, depending upon his Lord, has spoken in his Master&#8217;s name, and left a rich unction behind. Within the hand of God is the place of acceptance, and safety; and for service it is the place of power, as well as of concealment. God only works with those who are in His hand; and the more we lie hidden there, the more surely will He use us ere long. May the Lord do unto us according to His word, &#8220;I have put My words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of My hand.&#8221; In this case we shall feel all the former emotions combined: awe that the Lord should condescend to take us into His hand, rest and delight that He should deign to use us, trust that out of weakness we shall now be made strong, and to this will be added an absolute assurance that the end of our being must be answered, for that which is urged onward by the Almighty hand cannot miss its mark.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">These are mere surface thoughts. The subject deserves a series of discourses. Your best course, my beloved friends, will be to enlarge upon these hints by a long personal experience of abiding under the shadow of the Almighty. May God the Holy Ghost lead you into it, and keep you there, for Jesus&#8217; sake!</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div align="center">For more chapters of this wonderful book:</div><div align="center"><br /></div><div align="center">Chapter Three - Under The Apple Tree</div><div align="center"><b><br /><a href="http://faithfulmenofgod.blogspot.com/2007/12/till-he-come.html" target="_blank">Till He Come - by Charles Spurgeon</a></b></div></div></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is from two different passages in J. Vernon McGee's <i>Thru The Bible Commentary</i>, and portrays how the laws concerning a freed servant choosing to stay with his master out of love and devotion for him and for his bride is a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ choosing to go to the cross for us, out of love to us, His bride.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A Freed Servant Choosing To Remain With His Master - by J. Vernon McGee</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Law Concerning Master and Servant Relationships (Exodus 21:1-6)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Exodus 21 we come to social legislation. This part of the Law is an important issue at this time because the Israelites had been slaves in Egypt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing</i> [Exod. 21:1&#8211;2].</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These two verses clearly state that the Israelites could never permanently make one of their own brethren a slave.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master&#8217;s, and he shall go out by himself.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever</i> [Exod. 21:3&#8211;6].</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This remarkable law states that if a man is a slave, after seven years he can go free. If he was married when he became a slave, he can take his wife with him. If he married while a slave, that is, if he married a woman who was already a slave of his master, at the end of seven years he could go free, but his wife would still belong to the master. He would be free but his wife would not. He could, however, if he loved his wife and master, decide to stay of his own free will. If he decides to stay, his master is to bore his ear lobe through with an awl signifying that he will serve his master forever.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a beautiful picture of the Lord Jesus Christ. He came to this earth and took upon Himself our humanity. And we were all slaves of sin. He could have gone out free. He could have returned to heaven, to His position in the Godhead, without going through the doorway of death. He did not have to die upon the cross. But He willingly came down to earth and took upon Himself our humanity. <i>&#8220;And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross&#8221;</i> (Phil. 2:8).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Psalm 40:6&#8211;8 goes on to say, <i>&#8220;Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.&#8221;</i> This passage refers to Christ, because Hebrews 10:5&#8211;9 tells us that it does. It was fulfilled when our Lord came to this earth. <i>&#8220;Wherefore when he cometh into the world</i> [speaking of Christ], <i>he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me</i> [it was not only his ear that was &#8220;digged,&#8221; or bored through with an awl, but God gave Him a body which He will have throughout eternity]: <i>in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God. Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.&#8221;</i> Christ was <i>&#8220;made like unto His brethren.&#8221;</i> He chose not to go out free without us. He could have left this earth without dying, but He said, &#8220;I love My Bride. I love the sinner.&#8221; So He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross so that He could redeem us from the slavery of sin. What a picture this is of Christ &#8212; placed right here after the giving of the Ten Commandments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Theme: A Messianic Psalm Predicting The Crucifixion Of Christ (Psalm 40:6-9)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now the following is quoted in the Epistle to the Hebrews:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest</i> [Ps. 40:6&#8211;9].</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a marvelous psalm that follows the preceding one which reveals the frailty of man.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>&#8220;Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened.&#8221;</i> Now notice how this is quoted in Hebrew. 10:5, <i>&#8220;Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me.&#8221;</i> Now, wait a minute. Is this misquoted? Critics of the Bible say, &#8220;Oh, here is an error, a contradiction in the Bible. In Psalm 40:6 it says, <i>&#8216;&#8230; mine ears hast thou opened &#8230;&#8217;</i>; and in Hebrews it says, <i>&#8216;&#8230; a body hast thou prepared me.&#8217;</i> &#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Holy Spirit is the author of the Bible. He wrote the Old Testament and the New Testament. He wrote both Psalms and Hebrews, and He has a perfect right to change His own writing. When He does, there is always a good reason.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now let&#8217;s consider the background. In Exodus 21 there is a law concerning servants and masters. If a man became a slave to another man, at the end of a certain period of time he could go free. Suppose during that period he met another slave, a woman, they fell in love and married and had children. When it was time for the man to go free, he could leave, but his wife and children could not go with him because she was a slave. What could this man do? He could decide that because he loved his master and his wife he would not leave. <i>&#8220;Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever&#8221;</i> (Exod. 21:6).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The psalmist is referring to this custom when he says, <i>&#8220;mine ears hast thou opened.&#8221;</i> When the Lord Jesus came to this earth, did He have His ear thrust through with an awl? No, He was given a body. He took upon Himself our humanity. He identified Himself with us and He became a servant. And He became a sacrifice. <i>&#8220;Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire&#8221;</i> &#8212; God did not delight in all the animal offerings in the Old Testament, but they pointed to the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now notice what Isaiah says on this subject. <i>&#8220;The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back&#8221;</i> (Isa. 50:5). This verse is prophesying the humiliation of the Servant (Christ) who would come to earth. When the Lord Jesus came down to this earth and went to the cross, His ear wasn&#8217;t <i>&#8220;opened&#8221;</i> or &#8220;digged&#8221;; He was given a body, and that body was <i>nailed </i>to a cross. My friend, He has taken a glorified body with nail prints in it back to heaven, and He will bear those nail prints and scars throughout eternity that you and I might be presented without spot or blemish before Him. You see, He did more than have His ear bored through with an awl; He gave His body to be crucified because He loved us and would not return to heaven without us.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">My friend, this is a marvelous messianic psalm that reveals the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ because He loved us.</p>
