Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.</p><p> Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates. Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:</p><div><h4>Modern Language Association</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mla.org/style">http://www.mla.org/style</a></p><h4>The Chicago Manual of Style</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html</a></p><h4>American Psychological Association</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://apastyle.apa.org/">http://apastyle.apa.org/</a></p></div><h5>Notes:</h5><ul class="citationnotes"><li> Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers. Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content. However, the date of retrieval is often important. Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.</li><li> In addition to the MLA, Chicago, and APA styles, your school, university, publication, or institution may have its own requirements for citations. Therefore, be sure to refer to those guidelines when editing your bibliography or works cited list.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><div class="label-citation"><div class="icon-citation"> <button class="copy-citation"> <i class="fas fa-copy"></i> </button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="articleWrapper" id="articleWrapper-945857"> <span class="document-id" data-val="1G23486500030"></span><h1 class="doctitle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseExample2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="multiCollapseExample2"

should be pointed out. The colony was very active in the events leading up to the Revolution, and remained the main British base during much of the war. Nearly one-third of approximately three hundred battles and engagements took place on New York soil. The border warfare sustained by Loyalist and Indian raiders from Canada is recalled by many landmarks, particularly in the Mohawk Valley. These are the most apparent reasons. A less self-evident one is this: New Yorkers have shown an exceptional interest in preserving their colonial and Revolutionary history, perhaps partly because of their not being diverted by the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a> interest that predominates in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/south">the South</a>.</p><p>About 2,800 historic markers were erected in the thirteen years following the first appropriation of state funds for this purpose in 1926. The program was not controlled, typographical and historical errors were common, and proper records were not established. A new historic marker program, managed by the New York State Museum, was established in the 1960s, and the museum published a 129-page guide giving the text and location of approximately 139 large historical markers put up since 1960. The pocket-sized <i>Historical Area Markers in New York State</i> is available from the New York State Museum, which is located in Albany, New York on <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/madison-avenue">Madison Avenue</a> across the plaza from the State Capitol Building.

The Dutch trading post of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/fort-nassau">Fort Nassau</a> was built in 1614 on an island that now is part of the Albany seaport. Ten years later the first settlers arrived and built Fort Orange. The patroonship of Rensselaerswyck was established in 1630. Centered on Fort Orange, this vast tract straddled the Hudson and was settled by Dutch, Germans, Danes, Norwegians, Scots, and other nationalities. In 1652 the new director general of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-netherland">New Netherland</a> ordered the village of Beverwyck laid out around Fort Orange, and modern Albany got its name when the British took over in 1664. Transition of the colony from one European government to another occurred peacefully, Dutch settlers retaining their language, customs, and local institutions as their leaders—Van Rensselaers, Schuylers, Gansevoorts—mingled with Clintons, Yateses, and Livingstons. Rensselaerswyck became the Manor of Rensselaer and was the only "English" manor to survive the colonial era.</p><p>Albany has several important sites from the colonial and Revolutionary period. At the foot of State Street is the place where <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/henry-hudson">Henry Hudson</a> landed and where Fort Orange was built. A few blocks up the hill, at the other end of State Street, stood Fort Frederick, the objective of Burgoyne in 1777. At Lodge and Pine Streets is a marker pointing out that near here was the colonial hospital that treated the wounded from Saratoga in 1777, having previously received those from the 1758 attack on Ticonderoga. The body of Lord George Augustus Howe, killed in the latter battle, is said to lie beneath the vestibule floor of St. Peter's <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/protestant-denominations/episcopal-church">Episcopal Church</a> on State Street. This building dates from 1859 but contains important items going back to its origins in 1715.</p><p>The home of Colonel Philip Van Rensselaer preserves much of the quality and character dating from its construction in 1787. Located between First and McCarthy Avenues on 5231/2 South Pearl Street, it is operated by the state-chartered Historic Cherry Hill Association and is open most of the year. Phone: (518) 434-4791; website: www.historiccherryhill.org. Ten Broeck Mansion was built in 1798 by the militia general and Patriot politician Abraham Ten Broeck (1734–1810). Located at 9 Ten Broeck Place, it is furnished in the federal period and is open on a limited schedule. The mansion serves as the headquarters for the Albany County Historical Association. Phone: (518) 436-9826; website: www.tenbroeck.org.</p><p>The First Church in Albany (Dutch Reformed) on North Pearl Street at Clinton Square was organized in 1642 and has a pulpit dating from 1656, said to be the oldest in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/united-states">United States</a>. Sites associated with the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/albany-congress">Albany Congress</a> of 1754 have been destroyed by streets and buildings of downtown Albany, and both old churches were rebuilt after the Revolution. Across the bridge from Albany is Fort Crailo in Rensselaer.</p><p>Located at the corner of Clinton Avenue and Broadway is the Quackenbush House (c. 1730). It is the former home of Colonel Hendrique Quackenbush, who led Albany's Fifth Military Regiment against Burgoyne's army at Saratoga in 1777. Burgoyne was held prisoner at Quackenbush House for a short time after the battle of Saratoga. Privately owned, it is the oldest intact structure in the city of Albany, and is presently an upscale restaurant. Alongside the Quackenbush House is the Albany Visitor Center, wherein visitors can see a variety of maps and drawings of Albany during the American Revolution period.

Its master, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/philip-john-schuyler">Philip John Schuyler</a> (1733–1804), served the revolutionary cause in a number of capacities. A statue of a stern-faced Philip Schuyler in full general's regalia is located in front of City Hall on Eagle Street.</p><p>Philip was born into the fourth generation of the New York Schuylers. His mother was a Van Cortlandt, he married a Van Rensselaer, and one of his daughters married the eighth patroon of the Manor of Rensselaer. Another daughter married <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/alexander-hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>.</p><p>In 1763, when his father's estate finally was settled, thirty-year-old Philip Schuyler inherited thousands of acres in the Mohawk and Hudson Valleys. In addition, from his Uncle Philip he inherited the old Schuyler homestead where he had spent much of his childhood. This brick <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/ancient-history-middle-ages-and-feudalism/manor-house">manor house</a>, known as the Flats, built in 1666 and only slightly altered in three centuries, stood until burned in 1962 under mysterious circumstances (perhaps as a Halloween prank; the cause has never been determined) just as plans had been made to protect and restore it. The foundations remain (south edge of Watervliet on First Street), archaeology continues to yield important finds on both white and Indian settlements, and a nature trail has been put in near the site along the river. The Schuyler Flats Archeological District was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. In 2002 the town of Colonie, which owns the area, created the Schuyler Flatts Cultural Park. Philip also inherited lands in the Saratoga Patent, and here he built his country mansion at the place later called Schuylerville. (See under saratoga national historic park.)</p><p>Schuyler had an excellent education, was commissioned a captain at the start of the Seven Years' War, and gained a reputation as a logistician. In 1761 he started building a mansion on a gentle slope that rose from the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/hudson-river">Hudson River</a> just south of Albany's communal pasturing grounds. General John Bradstreet loaned him carpenters from British army units camped in the vicinity. While slaves and off-duty soldiers started putting up the mansion, Schuyler went to London with Bradstreet to help the latter settle his War Office accounts and to buy items for his own new house. He named his home the Pastures.</p><p>When completed in 1762 the Schuyler Mansion was a Georgian structure of rose-red brick, a building material much favored by the New York Dutch. (Salvaged brick from the Flats, mentioned above, has been used in the restoration of the Herkimer Home.) With a full basement, two stories, and a large attic with dormer windows, the house is 63 feet wide by 48 feet deep. The double-hip roof is enclosed by a wooden parapet of "Chinese" fretwork and is surmounted by twin chimneys. Detracting from the house's original lines is a six-sided vestibule leading to the front door, a tasteless addition of later years (the date not known). Four large rooms (almost 20 by 20 feet) are on each floor, arranged in the common plan of center-hall houses. The halls are 20 feet wide.</p><p>Furnishings and decorations of the Schuyler Mansion are particularly noteworthy. The state of New York purchased the building a little more than a century after it had passed out of possession of the family. Public funds were used to restore the building itself, but Schuyler descendants and private benefactors contributed furniture, furnishings, and other eighteenth-century treasures. Others contributed some $20,000 for purchase of period pieces before the mansion was opened to the public in 1917. The state has published a handsome book, <i>Schuyler Mansion: A Critical Catalogue of the Furnishings and Decorations</i>, by Anna K. Cunningham (1955). This admirable work includes 114 photographs of items in the collection, from paintings to jewelry, and is available through Willis Monie Books in Cooperstown, New York. Phone: (800) 322-2995.</p><p>The home you see today is fundamentally as Philip Schuyler and his many important guests knew it. The Pastures became unofficial headquarters of Patriot political and military affairs in the North. Schuyler was prominent in events leading to the Revolution, having been elected to the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/continental-congress">Continental Congress</a> in 1775 (again in 1777 and 1779–1780). He was military commander of the Northern Department until relieved of that post shortly before the battles of Saratoga. In October 1778 he was cleared of charges of incompetence in repelling Burgoyne's offensive, having meanwhile had "Gentleman Johnny" as a prisoner-guest at the Pastures. In April 1779 he resigned his commission as major general but held public office continuously until 1798. His daughter Elizabeth married <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/alexander-hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> at the Pastures, and Lafayette was a guest at the wedding. Visitors on other occasions included Washington, Franklin, Von Steuben, Rochambeau, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/benedict-arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>.</p><p>Schuyler Mansion is in the southern section of modern Albany at 32 Catharine Street. It is open to the public at specified hours.

Route 5S. A Catholic shrine was erected in 1930 to 1931 at the place where Father Isaac Jogues and other French Jesuit priests were martyred in the 1640s. Honoring the first North American saints, the shrine is on 600 landscaped acres and provides fine views of the Mohawk Valley.

Forts Clinton and Montgomery were captured by the British after a difficult march from Stony Point and a dangerous double envelopment astride Popolopen Creek. Most of the landmarks of this important and interesting operation are preserved within New York's newest historic park, the Fort Montgomery State Historic Site. The outer redoubt of Fort Clinton is in good condition, though a zoo now occupies the site of the main work, and only traces of other fortifications remain here. The site of Fort Montgomery, on the other hand, is free of modern encroachments. The outlines and foundations of this important river fortification have survived. Interpretive signs or an audio tour guide the visitor past the remains of the fort, the powder magazine, and the North Redoubt. There are also occasional Revolutionary War reenactments. Phone: (845) 786-2701, ext. 226.</p><h3><a id="BeekmanArms"><b>Beekman Arms</b> </a></h3><p><b>Beekman Arms,</b> Rhinebeck, mid-Hudson Valley. In about 1700 a two-room stone tavern was built where the Kings Highway crossed the Sepasco Indian trail, 60 miles south of Albany on the east side of the Hudson. The spot is now the intersection of U.S. 9 and N.Y. 308, at the center of Rhinebeck, and the tavern has evolved through two and a half centuries into a large modern inn. Its name comes from the fact that Henry Beekman sold the land on which this, "America's Oldest Operating Inn," was built. The present stone walls of the central portion date from an expansion in 1769. Oak beams measuring 8 by 12 inches support the first floor, which has planks 14 inches wide and 1.5 inches thick. In emergencies the tavern became a community fortress, with field artillery firing from the first floor and noncombatants being sheltered in the large cellar. General Montgomery lived in the inn before marching to his fate in Canada in 1775. Washington and many of his senior officers used the building during the Revolution.</p><p>The Beekman Arms retains a great deal of its eighteenth- and nineteenth-century character inside, where some original structural features can still be seen.

Phone: (518) 686-7109. Although many sites associated with the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/battle-bennington">Battle of Bennington</a> are in Vermont, the battlefield itself is in New York.</p><p>"Gentleman Johnny" Burgoyne met so little resistance as he moved along <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-champlain">Lake Champlain</a> toward the head of the Hudson Valley in 1777 that he became overconfident. He fatally underestimated the ability of the Patriots to organize an effective resistance. But Burgoyne could see that he would have to live off the country now that his 185-mile-long line of communications with his Canadian bases was being overtaxed. He particularly needed horses to move his artillery and wagons, and to mount the 250 Brunswick dragoons. Inaccurate intelligence convinced him that the Continentals had a large number of horses as well as other military stores at Bennington.</p><p>Piling blunder on blunder, Burgoyne selected the Brunswickers to form the nucleus of this eight-hundred-man expedition, because these were the people who most needed the horses. Their commander, Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Baum, spoke no English, and since one purpose of the operation was to win Loyalist support in the areas overrun, Philip Skene, Loyalist proprietor of some 60,000 acres around modern Whitehall (then called Skenesboro), was sent along as "public affairs advisor." In addition to his own dragoons and other Germans totaling 374 officers and men, Baum had fifty British marksmen and three hundred or so Loyalists, Canadians, and Indians. By 13 August his expedition had reached Cambridge, about 20 miles by road from Bennington, Vermont.</p><p>In the few weeks before this operation, however, the Patriots had become sufficiently aroused to start taking action. The present state of Vermont, a wilderness claimed by New York, Massachusetts, and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-hampshire">New Hampshire</a> in colonial times, had been known since 1763 as the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-hampshire">New Hampshire</a> Grants and was sparsely populated. When the Vermont Council of Safety asked for help, New Hampshire and Massachusetts both said they lacked the necessary funds. The wealthy John Langdon, a Patriot of New Hampshire, allegedly stepped forward in this crisis to offer his personal fortune and credit and to nominate "our friend Stark" as commander of the forces to be raised.</p><p>John Stark accepted a commission as a brigadier general from New Hampshire on 17 July and quickly raised a force of about 1,500. The colorful and temperamental hero of Bunker Hill had resigned his commission as a colonel of the Continental army about four months earlier because Congress would not promote him. The "rustic Achilles" agreed to quit sulking in his tent and take the field only when assured that he would be independent of Congressional orders.</p><p>When Stark arrived with his brigade at Manchester, Vermont (about 26 miles by road north of Bennington), from which point he intended to attack the flank and rear of Burgoyne's forces in the Hudson Valley, he ran into trouble. A fat major general from Massachusetts, one of the officers previously promoted over Stark's head, was there with orders from Congress to take command of all <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-england">New England</a> militia raised for the emergency. This individual also had orders from General Schuyler to send Stark's brigade to join the main army on the Hudson. John Stark flat refused. General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/benjamin-lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a> tried to make Stark see that such insubordination could be disastrous to the Patriot cause, but when reasoning accomplished nothing, Lincoln showed the character and good sense not to give up in disgust. He reported this problem to Congress, but then proceeded to treat Stark as an ally and to fall in with Stark's strategic notions. Lincoln agreed to his plan of operating against the enemy's flank and rear, and he urged Schuyler to modify his own plans accordingly.</p><p>Ironically, Stark's insubordination resulted in his being located, completely by accident, at the very place toward which the enemy raiders were headed: Bennington.</p><p>Seth Warner and his Green Mountain Regiment had reassembled at Manchester after their defeat at Hubbardton, Vermont. Here they remained temporarily when Stark moved on to Bennington, some 25 miles south, where he was joined by Vermont's troops, some militia from the Berkshires, and the Stockbridge Indians.</p><p>Having camped in Cambridge overnight, Baum resumed his advance on the morning of 14 August, a Thursday. When Stark heard that Indians were ravaging the area around Cambridge, he had sent a two-hundredman detachment there to chase them off, but on the evening of 13 August he learned that enemy regulars in strength were following the Indians. He therefore ordered Warner to move his men immediately to Bennington. Baum's scouts, meanwhile, reported that the militia force in Bennington was much larger than expected, so the German commander reported back to Burgoyne that he would advance cautiously.</p><p>The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/battle-bennington">Battle of Bennington</a> started around 9:00 the morning of Thursday, 14 August 1777 at St. Croix, or Sancoick's Mill, about 12 miles from Bennington, Vermont, on modern Route 67 and 67A (roughly the route Baum was marching). Stark held the bulk of his forces at a crossing of the Walloomsac about 4 miles from town while detachments carried out a delaying action. Baum advanced slowly, and finally decided he had better request reinforcements. When he reached the point where the road crossed the Walloomsac, he secured this critical area with troops on both sides of the river and started deploying the rest of his force in small defensive detachments.</p><p>With the idea of establishing a position he could hold until reinforcements arrived, Baum made the fundamental error of scattering his forces. On the Bennington side of the river about 150 of his men, most of them Loyalists, constructed a hasty fortification that became known as the Tory Redoubt. On the other side of the crossing were about seventy-five regulars. Camp followers found and occupied a log cabin between the Tory Redoubt and the river crossing, and other cabins on either side of the river were occupied by Loyalists and Canadians. On the side of a hill overlooking the crossing from the north (his direction of advance), Baum placed 200 officers and men in a position that became known as the Dragoon Redoubt. On top of this hill the Indians encamped. Back along the road to Sancoick's Mill, about 1,000 yards from the vital crossing, Baum posted fifty German infantrymen and some Loyalists to guard his rear. To keep the Americans from infiltrating along the right (north) bank of the river to the crossing site, a detachment of fifty jaegers was posted between the Dragoon Redoubt and the river.</p><p>The next day, Friday, 15 August, was so rainy that both sides were content to remain inactive, particularly because both were waiting for their reinforcements to arrive. About 350 of Seth Warner's men left Manchester on Friday morning and made camp that night about two hours' march from Stark's bivouac. Lieutenant Colonel Breymann started marching to Baum's relief on Friday morning with about 650 slow-moving German grenadiers, chasseurs, riflemen, and two cannon. But when he went into camp that night he had covered only 8 miles, and he did not reach the battlefield until 4:30 the next afternoon.</p><p>Stark, meanwhile, had reconnoitered the enemy positions and formulated the plan of attack so dear to the hearts of military amateurs—the double envelopment. Splitting his forces into three columns, he planned to have two of these loop wide around the enemy's flanks to join in an attack on his rear, while he himself led the main body in the middle. The rain stopped around noon on Saturday 16 August, and at 3 p.m. the Patriots launched their attack. Two hours later, after what Stark in his report called "the hottest [action] I ever saw in my life—it represented one continued clap of thunder," the first part of the battle was over, and the Patriots had possession of the field. They were preparing to loot the enemy camps when, to their considerable consternation, Breymann's relief column was reported to be only 2 miles away. Breymann had reached Sancoick's Mill around 4:30, half an hour before Baum fell mortally wounded and resistance in the Dragoon Redoubt had collapsed. But because of the phenomenon known as "acoustic shadow," no sound of battle had been heard at Sancoick's Mill, only 4 miles distant. Breymann's troops realized too late that they had marched into a hornets' nest. Warner's Green Mountain Regiment arrived just in time to play the leading role in this final action, which lasted until dark. The Germans then withdrew, leaving Breymann's 2 cannon. Stark reported the capture of 4 cannon (Baum had only 2), 2 brass drums, 250 sabres, 4 ammunition wagons, and several hundred stand of arms. Enemy casualties numbered about 200 dead on the field (others, including Baum, died of wounds) and around 700 prisoners. Only 9 of the 374 Germans of Baum's force returned to Burgoyne's army. Stark reported the loss of 30 of his command killed and 40 wounded, although the generally accepted figure is 40 Americans killed and wounded.</p><p>This was one victory the Patriots badly needed. It did much to set the stage for Burgoyne's greater defeat at Saratoga.</p><p>Bennington Battlefield State Park encompasses about 276 acres of wooded terrain, and at the battlefield's entrance there is a marker. A map for the entire area is available onsite, and three stone memorials can be found at the top of the hill, in addition to various markers that indicate battlefield positions. From the entrance on the highway a tourist winds up a narrow road through second-growth woods, circles a grassy hill, and can park near the top. This is the site of the Dragoon Redoubt, where the fiercest fighting took place, and there is an excellent map showing troop movements and positions. But even with a good mental picture of what happened at Bennington, it is difficult for visitors to orient themselves. The landmarks of the action are not readily identifiable from this observation point. If a person leaves it and walks back up the road and to the northwest, through a vista cut in that direction can be seen the hill where the Indian auxiliaries of Baum's were positioned on the eve of the battle. Having seen this, one gets a somewhat clearer picture of the total action and can locate the route by which Colonel Moses Nichols enveloped Baum's position. However, until the site is developed further, a visitor will not be able to visualize the action at the Tory Redoubt and the position of the jaegers on the southern slope of the hill below the Dragoon Redoubt. (Sites associated with Stark's approach to the battlefield are covered under bennington and vicinity, vermont.)</p><p>Leaving Bennington Battlefield State Park and driving west and north to Cambridge for 10 miles, a tourist will find landmarks of the German advance. Initially, the route is through ugly vestiges of the mill operations that developed in modern times along the Walloomsac River. The site of Breymann's defeat is indicated by a highway marker a little less than a mile west of the entrance to the battlefield park, but there is nothing else to see here except a run-down industrial plant, railroad tracks, and evidence of economic distress. Exactly 2 miles farther west on N.Y. 67 is a highway marker on the left (south) side indicating that St. Croix Church was here, so this is in the vicinity of Sancoick's Mill, where the action started on 14 August (above). The visitor who continues north on N.Y. 22 toward Cambridge (a fine highway through scenic country), will pass the place where Patriot militia skirmished with Baum's advance guard. (Historical marker is on the right [east] of the road .35 mile north of the N.Y. 67-22 road junction, 4 miles south of Cambridge.)</p><p>On entering the village of Cambridge, a visitor will learn from a marker on the left (west) that this is the route of the Great <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/northern-war">Northern War</a> Trail, along which the Indians took their captives from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-england">New England</a> to Canada from about 1650 to 1700. Other than an open space at the junction of N.Y. 22 and 327 in Cambridge that was a militia training ground, there are no Revolutionary War sites to see in this attractive little place where Baum camped before marching toward Bennington. (See bennington under Vermont for the site of Baum's death of wounds and his burial. Here also the landmarks associated with the Patriot advance to the battlefield may be found.)</p><h3><b>Boyd-Parker Memorial</b></h3><p><b>Boyd-Parker Memorial,</b> site of Little Beard's Town, or Genesee. <i>See</i>sullivan-clinton expedition.</p><h3><a id="BushHomesteadPutnamsHeadquarters"><b>Bush Homestead (Putnam's Headquarters)</b> </a></h3><p><b>Bush Homestead (Putnam's Headquarters),</b> Port Chester, also known as the Bush-Lyon Homestead.

On Switzer Hill, near Fonda, overlooking the Mohawk River, the ancient home-stead of the much-dreaded Loyalist soldiers John and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/walter-butler">Walter Butler</a> remains standing despite almost two centuries of local indifference to its historic and architectural significance. The simple frame house built in 1742 by "Old" <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/walter-butler">Walter Butler</a> has survived the modifications of successive farmer-owners, who masked its cherry paneling and hand-hewn beams with lath and plaster, made rambling additions, and covered its clapboard siding with asbestos shingle. The magnificent view over the Mohawk to the west from the 700-foot hill remains virtually unspoiled.</p><p>"Old" Walter Butler and his son John were among <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/sir-william-johnson">Sir William Johnson</a>'s most valuable subordinates, and their landholdings in the Mohawk Valley—7,800 acres—approached his in magnitude. But the Butlers earned their position in history by military duty far from their comfortable home fires. John spent much of his youth at the exposed outpost of Fort Ontario, where his father was commandant, and he was fifty-three years old when, in the summer of 1778, he led Loyalist and Indian raiders almost 200 miles through the wilderness from Niagara to attack the Wyoming Valley settlement in Pennsylvania. "Young" Walter, John's son and "Old" Walter's grandson, was known as one of the brightest young men in the valley when he was studying law in Albany on the eve of the Revolution. He turned out to be equally talented as a man of military action.</p><p>Among the many Loyalists who fled to Canada, John and Walter Butler were the most effective leaders of the raids that subsequently ravaged the Mohawk Valley. Young Walter was captured at the Shoemaker House in 1777 while on one of the boldest missions of the war. Sentenced to death but reprieved because of the intercession of several Patriots, including Philip Schuyler, he escaped to Canada. (There he helped a former neighbor, as outlined in the article on fort frey.) After leading the famous raid on Cherry Valley, Major Walter Butler played a key role in the operations of Major Ross in 1781 (see johnstown) and was killed in the rear-guard action on West Canada Creek.</p><p>Colonel <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-butler">John Butler</a> was active in establishing a settlement of Loyalists in Canada, where he was given 5,000 acres and a pension. Until his death at the age of seventy-one he held important public offices.</p><p>The Butler estate was confiscated by the Patriots during the Revolution and later bought by John Fonda. In 1834 his widow and son Jelles sold it to <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/henry-wilson">Henry Wilson</a>, whose family occupied the house and farmed the land through the 1940s. For a few years the house remained unoccupied and neglected until bought by Mrs. Eleanore Rockwell in 1959. Extensive restoration of the interior has been completed. When what was believed to be a post-Revolution addition to the back of the house was taken off, an 1826 penny was found, which confirmed the suspicion and eliminated the "saltbox" character of the house. In late 1971, after Mrs. Rockwell's death, her daughter Cynthia moved into Butlersbury with her family. Among the first guests were several busloads of Canadians revisiting the homes of their Loyalist ancestors. Butlersbury has had new owners since that time, and remains privately owned.</p><p>The house is reached from Fonda by driving east about 100 yards and turning north on Switzer Hill Road. At .75 mile, turn right on Old Trail and go 100 yards to Walter Butler Lane on the right. The house is visible on the left (east) side of this short, dead-end road, about 100 yards away. Casual tourists will find the site is well worth visiting for the view. Since ownership is in private hands, tours are not available, but information is available by contacting the Montgomery County Department of History and Archives.

During the period 1580 to 1666 they had approximately sixteen villages known as Indian castles, but all except Auriesville were burned in 1666. The four built to replace these were again destroyed in 1693, and the Mohawks were greatly reduced in numbers. The survivors then planned a separate castle for each clan, and these were in existence from 1700 until 1775, when the Mohawks took the British side in the American Revolution and were finally driven from the valley. Sites of the last three Indian castles are at Fort Hunter (Wolf), Fort Plain (Turtle), and Indian Castle (Bear).</p><p>The other Iroquois tribes had castles to the west, most of which were destroyed by the Sullivan-Clinton Expedition of 1779.</p><h3><a id="CherryValley"><b>Cherry Valley</b> </a></h3><p><b>Cherry Valley,</b> Otsego County. Walter Butler and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/north-american-indigenous-peoples-biographies/joseph-brant">Joseph Brant</a> owe their negative reputation as Loyalist and Indian raiders primarily to the fact that they were such good military leaders. They collaborated in a raid on this strategically important settlement and surprised the ineptly commanded garrison ignorant of frontier warfare. The 700 Loyalists and Indians killed some 30 noncombatants and 15 soldiers in an action (11 November 1778) lasting about four hours. The raiders took 71 prisoners but released most of them the next day.</p><p>A memorial was erected in the Cherry Valley cemetery on the 100th anniversary of the massacre, and the local museum, at 49 Main Street, has items of historical interest and information on walking tours of historic Cherry Valley.

The first <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/robert-livingston">Robert Livingston</a> (1654–1728) reached America in 1673, and by 1686 had by purchase and grant acquired 160,000 acres on the east side of the Hudson. His third son, also named Robert, was bequeathed 13,000 acres in the southwest corner of the Manor of Livingston. This Robert II built Clermont around 1730. His son, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/british-and-irish-history-biographies/robert-iii">Robert III</a>, married Margaret Beekman in 1742, and when the British in their raid of 1777 burned Clermont it was this vigorous lady who undertook immediately to rebuild the mansion. North and south wings were added in 1800.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/robert-livingston">Robert Livingston</a> IV, statesman and diplomat of the Revolutionary era, retired to Clermont in 1804 after negotiating the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/louisiana-purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> in his capacity as minister to France. Here, in addition to work in progressive agriculture, he pursued his earlier interest in steam navigation. He and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/science-and-technology/technology-biographies/robert-fulton">Robert Fulton</a> produced the first practical steamboat, which was named for the Livingston home and which made a record-setting run up the river to this place.</p><p>The steep-pitched roof and dormers of Clermont date from 1878. The state now owns the house with 500 acres, and restoration has been completed. In 1973 it was designated a National Historic Landmark, and the site is a key element to the Hudson River National Landmark District, which was established in 1990. Clermont is the most important of the many structures associated with the remarkable Livingston family, and a local organization, Friends of Clermont, provides tours and maintains an informative website on the house and grounds.

Here, at the main entrance to the Hudson Highlands east of the river and a few hundred yards south of the junction of the Old <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/west-point">West Point</a> Road and the Old Albany Post Road in 1777, the Patriots established a camp and supply center. A few months later (9 October) the small guard detachment was routed by a British force under Governor <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/william-tryon">William Tryon</a>, and the base was destroyed. Maps of Robert Erskine thereafter indicated "Burnt Barracks" at this place on Canopus Hollow Road, but the Patriots reoccupied the area in 1781. This and other Patriot camps in the vicinity have been excavated by the New York Historical Society.</p><h3><a id="CrownPointReservationAndCampsite"><b>Crown Point Reservation and Campsite</b> </a></h3><p><b>Crown Point Reservation and Campsite,</b> 739 Bridge Road on the west end of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-champlain">Lake Champlain</a> Bridge. In 1609 Champlain visited this site in his voyage of discovery, and his battle with the Iroquois took place either in this area or at Ticonderoga, about 12 miles farther south. Recent research reveals that the French built a fort across the lake on the Vermont side at Chimney Point before starting the construction of Fort St. Frédéric at Crown Point in 1731. The latter was an outpost for the protection of Canada and also a forward base for their own raids on English settlements. At the approach of Amherst's expedition in 1759 the French garrison blew up their fort and retreated to Canada. (See also ticonderoga.)</p><p>The English started building a large fort a short distance inland from demolished Fort St. Frédéric, but with French power in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/north-america">North America</a> almost immediately thereafter broken (1763), the plans for making Fort Crown Point a major fortification were curtailed. A fire in 1773 virtually destroyed the outpost, and when Seth Warner occupied the place two years later (after the capture of Ticonderoga) he found a pathetic little garrison of nine men and some camp followers.</p><p>During the remainder of the Revolution, Crown Point was important only as an outpost for Ticonderoga. It figured in Arnold's naval operations (see valcour island) and as a post on the British line of communications in 1776 and 1777.</p><p>Now split by the highway leading to the great bridge across Lake Champlain but not disfigured by these modern developments, Crown Point Reservation and Campsite is a picturesque state park. The ruins of the French and English forts are classified as National Historic Landmarks. The French did a thorough job of blowing up Fort Frédéric, which had never been fully developed anyhow: the design was faulty and the construction work had been unsatisfactory. Part of the ruins are fenced off, but the ramparts of this star fort remain.</p><p>The English fort, only a few hundred feet away, is a ruin of exceptional beauty and interest. A narrow footpath leads around the top of the ramparts, an earthen mound rising some 30 feet in places from a moat. Portions of this moat were blasted from rock. Inside these high earthen walls are the ruins of two large masonry barracks, their gray walls rising from a green carpet of grass. A spring feeds a rock pool within the parade ground. One would hope that the site will be preserved as a picturesque ruin (like the Loire River chateau of Chinon, where <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/french-history-biographies/joan-arc">Joan of Arc</a> entered the pages of history).</p><p>Across the highway is the campsite. In addition to the vestiges of other fortifications, monuments, historic markers, and a replica of the French trading post, this park includes the Champlain Memorial Lighthouse (1909). On the side facing the lake is a particularly fine bronze by Rodin: a life-size head of a woman symbolizing La France.</p><p>The sites are closed during the winter months.

Since 1913 incorporated in the town of Beacon, Fishkill Landing was an outpost of the Continental army's defensive system in the Hudson Highlands. Nearby Fishkill Village was a main supply base. In laying plans for letting the British capture the strategic works at West Point, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/benedict-arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> found pretexts for weakening its garrison by detaching troops to the Fishkill area for guard duty and to cut wood. In relatively recent years the last vestiges of earthworks have been obliterated, but the site of "Fort Hill" is indicated by a marker on U.S. 9 at the county line.</p><p>Mount Beacon (1,640 feet) was once accessible by a renowned inclined railway from 1902 until the railway's closing in 1975. At a point 1 mile by trail to the summit was a signal station during the Revolution, and there rests a 27-foot high monument erected to honor militiamen who were in charge of the beacon fires. The trail continues 2 miles to South Beacon Peak (1,635 feet). Mount Beacon is accessible to hikers, and plans for another railway are continually being proposed.</p><h3><a id="FishkillVillage"><b>Fishkill Village</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fishkill Village,</b> near intersection of U.S. 9 and I-84, in southwest Dutchess County. About 5 miles road distance east of Fishkill Landing (now part of Beacon) and lying pleasantly in the lap of a plain near the foot of the mountains, as Benson Lossing described it, the village of Fishkill is rich in Revolutionary War associations. In 1775 it comprised only a dozen or so houses, a tavern, two churches, and a schoolhouse, although Dutch settlers had been in the area since the start of the century. Wiccopee Pass, just south of the village, was fortified early in the war, with three artillery battery positions there from 1776 to 1783 and a lookout point nearby as the signal relay station to Washington's headquarters in Newburgh. In relatively recent years the last vestiges of earthworks have been obliterated, but the site of "Fort Hill" is indicated by a marker on U.S. 9 at the county line. Barracks and storehouses were constructed in Fishkill, and the place became the principal military depot for the Continental army.</p><p>When the British overran the lower Hudson Valley, Fishkill was crowded with refugees. The New York Provincial Congress was in session here during the period 5 September 1776 to 11 February 1777, after being run from New York City to White Plains and before moving on to Kingston. The ambulatory legislators met in the First Reformed, or Dutch, Church, which also served as a prison. A famous inmate of the prison was Enoch Crosby, the model used by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/james-fenimore-cooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a> for his character Harvey Birch in <i>The Spy, A Tale of the Neutral Ground</i>.</p><p>The Dutch Church, 1153 Main Street, dates from 1731, and the exterior of stuccoed stone and brick has been little changed. The interior was radically altered in 1854, and it was after this date that most of the village's surviving houses were built. Phone: (845) 896-9836.</p><p>Trinity <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/protestant-denominations/episcopal-church">Episcopal Church</a>, Main Street, east of Route 9, was built around 1769. It was a hospital during the Revolution. Except for removal of the upper part of the tall steeple, which became necessary in 1803 because it was structurally unsound, the exterior of the small frame church is unaltered. Of special architectural interest is its curious cornice. (The hollow concave molding known as cavetto is used rather than the more usual cymatium—a practice common in Etruscan architecture.) Phone: (845) 896-9884.</p><p>Because of its association with Fishkill Landing, where a ferry was established in 1743 and where Hudson River traffic stopped, the village of Fishkill was an unusually important stop on the Albany Post Road, or King's Highway. On U.S. 9 about 1.3 miles south of Fishkill is an old red stone marker inscribed "66 Miles to N. York." Although the Albany Post Road dates from 1703, when an act of the colonial assembly started its construction, the more than forty milestones were not set up until after 1797. About half have survived, having been reset in concrete with protective coverings, and can be discovered at various points. The stone markers were erected on the order of the new nation's first postmaster, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/benjamin-franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, to assist mail carriers in navigation.</p><p>The Derick Brinkerhoff House, about 3 miles east of Fishkill at the junction of N.Y. 52 and 82, is where Washington stayed whenever he came through. The house is still owned by a family descendant, Todd Brinkerhoff. Across the street, a blue marker was erected to show the Abraham Brinkerhoff store site. Visible from the Derick Brinkerhoff House is a large marker, the Lafayette Memorial informing visitors that the major general lay there many weeks recuperating from a near-fatal fever. Upon his recuperation, subsequent victory over Cornwallis in 1781, and return to France, Lafayette sent, as a token of his gratitude, a large French-made punch bowl. That bowl now rests in the Madam Brett Homestead, 50 Van Nydeck Avenue, in Beacon. The Madam Brett Homestead, maintained and shown by the Melzingah Chapter of the <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/social-organizations/private-organizations/daughters-american-revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a>, is the oldest building (c. 1709) in Dutchess County.

Colonial and Revolutionary War forts were located at this critical point along the Hudson-Champlain route. From a contour map one can see why: Fort Ann is at the mouth of a defile through which troops moving south along Wood Creek from Skenesboro (now Whitehall) would debouch into flatter country for the rest of their march to the Hudson. The British built a fort here in 1757. The next year about five hundred men under <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/israel-putnam">Israel Putnam</a> and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/robert-rogers">Robert Rogers</a> were sent by Abercromby to observe French activity around Ticonderoga. They were returning to Fort Edward from around Skenesboro when they were ambushed in the area of modern Kanesville, about a mile northwest of Fort Ann. Putnam was wounded, taken prisoner, and cruelly treated before being sent to Montreal and eventually exchanged.</p><p>A delaying action against Burgoyne's invasion in 1777 was fought on 8 July in the gorge about three-quarters of a mile north of Fort Ann (mentioned earlier). Colonel Pierce Long had fallen back with his 150-man rear guard, and at Fort Ann he was reinforced by about 400 New York militia under Colonel Henry Van Rensselaer. Having fewer than 200 men, the commander of the British advance guard decided to stop and wait for reinforcements. Van Rensselaer and Long sallied forth about 10:30 a.m. One Patriot column crossed to the east bank of the creek (now the barge canal) and threatened the British flank and rear as the other attacked the mouth of the defile. Hard-pressed, the British shifted their position from the bottom of the narrow gorge (now widened out and deforested) to the sharp, 500-foot-high ridge to the north (on the left as one drives from Fort Ann toward Whitehall). The Patriots broke off the engagement after two hours of fierce fighting because their ammunition was running out and the war whoops of enemy reinforcements were heard in the distance. It was later revealed (during the investigation of Burgoyne's operations) that these "Indian war whoops" all emanated from one British captain advancing alone after his troops refused to follow him into the battle.</p><p>Although it may be difficult to find, a marker indicating "Battle Hill" is located about one-half mile past the bank on U.S. Route 4. There is a railroad intersection on the right and a large rock cut on the left. Just into the rock cut is the marker. Ownership of the actual battlefield is in flux and a highway runs through it, but visitors can get a sense of the grounds where this significant confrontation took place.

The town of Fort Edward is located near the Hudson River's end on Route 197. Prior to the 1700s, the Indians named this area the Great Carrying Place because the river's end forced them to portage their canoes over to Lake Champlain. Fort Edward, briefly the third-largest city in British <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/north-america">North America</a>, was the site of British works built in 1709, 1731, 1755, and 1757. The famous rangers of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/robert-rogers">Robert Rogers</a> were based here during the colonial wars. The 40-acre site of these early forts and the ranger camps is on Rogers Island, joined to today's village of Fort Edward by N.Y. Route 197. Natural and man-made changes in the Hudson River have vastly altered the island's configuration since colonial times, portions of the original island having become part of the mainland and vice versa. Rogers Island, although still privately owned (at this writing the state is negotiating a purchase) was opened to the public in July 2001. The site is primarily devoted to history of the Seven Years' War and features a visitors center that is open daily from June through August. Admission is free. In September an annual Seven Years' War encampment is presented. Phone: (518) 747-3693; website: www.fortedwardnewyork.net.</p><p>If one goes south on U.S. 4 and N.Y. Route 197 through the village of Fort Edward and passes under the railroad, there is a marker on the right (west) that says that the northeast bastion of the old fort was near there. The marker is encompassed within the grounds of the Anvil Inn Restaurant. Continue straight (not bearing left on the highway) and take the first right onto Old Fort Street. On the right (north) is a marker indicating that the low ground there was part of the old moat. Continue a few hundred feet to the dead end at the river, opposite Rogers Island, and there is a boulder with a plaque attached marking the site of Fort Edward, 1775.</p><p>If the traveler retraces their route and continues south on the highway, just to the west of U.S. 4 and 0.1 mile beyond the junction with N.Y. 197 is the Old Fort House Museum. Built in 1772 by Patrick Smyth, it was constructed in part with timbers from the ruined Fort Edward. In 1777 Benedict Arnold arrested Smyth and removed him from his home for being a Loyalist. At various historic junctures, the house was used by Generals Schuyler, Arnold, Washington, Burgoyne, and Stark. The two-story white structure has been restored and is a regional museum with Indian relics, furniture, glass, models, and dioramas. It is open to the public daily from June to August, on weekends from September to October, and year-round by appointment.

The episode has been so distorted that the facts will never be certain, but the following outline may be considered reasonably accurate: McCrae was captured by a small patrol of Burgoyne's Indians and killed when another patrol appeared with orders from her Loyalist fiancé to bring word from her. McCrae's captor, a Huron named Le Loup but better known in legend as the Wyandotte Panther, presumably expected a reward for his young female prisoner, and in a fit of rage he ended the argument with the other Indian leader by shooting her. McCrae's scalp was identified by her fiancé in the British camp, and another prisoner filled in what details she could of the episode. Then the propagandists and mythmakers took over.</p><p>A marker in front of a privately owned dwelling just north of the high school states that it is the Jane McRae House, supposedly the place of her capture. However, the actual place of her capture was just behind this dwelling, at what used to be Sara McNeil's house. A marker of the actual site where McRae was killed can be found just south of the high school. A highway marker says "The graves of Duncan Campbell and Jane McCrae are just within and to the left of this gateway." Enclosed by a high iron fence, the graves are easy to spot as one drives into the large cemetery. The white stone on McCrae's grave was erected in 1852 by a niece when the remains were moved from their second burial place (in Fort Edward). Her age is given erroneously as seventeen; she probably was twenty-six years old at her death. About 2.2 miles south of the bridge one crosses when leaving Fort Edward on U.S. 4 is the marked site of McCrae's first grave (on the west side of the highway). A Patriot camp was here when the famous atrocity occurred.</p><p>Another legend of some renown is connected with Union Cemetery. The story is that Duncan Campbell of Inverawe, major of the Forty-second Regiment of Foot, better known as the Royal Highlanders, or Black Watch, had witnessed a murder but had sworn to keep his knowledge secret. When he later learned that the victim was his own cousin, he still held fast to his oath, whereupon the cousin's ghost appeared in a dream and said, "Farewell, Inverawe, till we meet at Ticonderoga." Campbell tried to rise above his superstitions as his regiment moved on Ticonderoga in 1758 with Abercromby's expedition, but on the eve of battle he is said to have resigned himself to death. He was mortally wounded and died nine days later, 17 July, at Fort Edward. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/english-literature-19th-cent-biographies/robert-louis-stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a> knew the story, which was famous in Scottish history, and while spending six months at Saranac Lake (1887–1888) he used it for his ballad "Ticonderoga." The poet errs in the concluding lines: "He sleeps in the place of the name, / As it was doomed to be." At Ticonderoga is a monument to the Black Watch that mentions the above episode. But Campbell does not sleep at Ticonderoga; he sleeps beneath an interesting old brown headstone next to Jane McCrae.</p><p>For reference and information on these and other sites, contact the Fort Edward Historical Association listed previously in this section.</p><h3><a id="FortFrey"><b>Fort Frey</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Frey,</b> Mohawk Valley. On N.Y. Route 5, exactly a mile west of the junction of N.Y. Route 10 in Palatine Bridge, a state marker identifies the Frey House. Just west of this sign, on the south side of the highway, is the start of a private road that winds 0.3 mile to the house. It is privately owned (1971) but can be viewed from the outside.</p><p>Typically Palatine, this long, stone, story-and-a-half house with a gable roof was built in 1739 on the site of a log cabin erected in 1689 by Hendrick Frey, a Swiss. British military posts were located here in 1702 to 1713 and 1755 to 1763.</p><p>Hendrick Frey died shortly before the Revolution, but his three sons were active in the war. The most famous, John, was born in the Frey House in 1740 and became chairman of the Tryon County Committee of Safety and major of the Palatine Regiment, Tryon County Militia Brigade. His brothers, Bernard and Philip, became officers on the British side. John was wounded at Oriskany, narrowly escaping death before going to Canada as a prisoner. From the surviving Frey papers it is known that he was well treated. Major Frey's old neighbor, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-butler">John Butler</a> of Butlersbury, saw that he got the best medical attention available and better food than was the normal lot of prisoners, and on one occasion Butler prescribed an issue of port wine to speed Frey's recovery. When John Frey finally was exchanged, John Butler lent him 20 guineas to get home. When Montgomery County was formed from Tryon County in 1784, John Frey became its first sheriff. He was state senator for twenty years and helped write <i>Annals of Tryon County</i>.</p><p>Bernard Frey served in Butler's Rangers, was promoted to captain in 1780, and settled in Niagara, upper Canada. He was killed during the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/war-1812">War of 1812</a>.</p><p>Philip served as an ensign in the Eighth Foot during the Revolution. A surveyor and an attorney, he later returned to the Mohawk Valley and practiced law not far from his birthplace.</p><h3><a id="FortHerkimerChurch"><b>Fort Herkimer Church</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Herkimer Church,</b> 2 miles east of Mohawk on N.Y. Route 5S. Construction of this building was started by Palatine settlers about 1730 to replace a log church of 1723, but work was not finished when the Seven Years' War started in 1754 and the walls formed the center of colonial Fort Herkimer. (Another Fort Herkimer, dating from 1775, was the wooden blockhouse that had fallen into ruin and was the site of the Revolutionary War's Fort Dayton. See german flats.) The present structure, altered and enlarged in 1812, dates from 1767. Johan Herkimer (also spelled "Herchheimer" and "Erghemer"), father of Revolutionary War General Nicholas Herkimer, and twelve others established a trading post here after emigrating from the Rhenish Palatinate around 1722, and an inscription on the church indicates that he built it in 1767.</p><p>During the Revolution the church was part of a stockaded fort, and here settlers were saved on Sunday, 13 September 1778, from a raid by Loyalists and Indians that ravaged their property in the neighborhood. They had been warned by Adam Helmer, who detected the raiders and stayed ahead of their fastest runners in a dramatic 22-mile race to the settlements.</p><p>Later the walls were raised 10 feet to convert the structure from fort to church, and a pitched roof and cupola were added. A picturesque graveyard adjoins the church. The site is open for special occasions and is used for Revolutionary War reenactments.

Here the remains of Fort Franklin (earthworks and barracks) are in the hands of a private owner. In the days of the Revolution, American and French troops made several attempts to capture Fort Franklin. When the British abandoned it at the close of the war, they threw guns into wells and buried others. Some of these have been recovered and placed in spots overlooking the harbor.

Queen Anne ordered construction of a chapel here in 1712 "for my Mohawk Indians." The chapel is gone, some of its cut stone having been used in 1820 for the lock of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/erie-canal">Erie Canal</a> on Schoharie Creek, but the stone parsonage has survived. Still standing as a testimonial to ancient American craftsmanship is the Dutch Barn (dating from about 1730). Fort Hunter is under the jurisdiction of the New York State Military Museum.

Route 67 joins N.Y. Route 5. This is the third home of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/william-johnson">William Johnson</a>, built in 1749 when his personal fortunes had prospered because of his success as an Indian agent and militia colonel in King George's War (1744–1745). Both of his earlier homes have been lost—the small frame building in which he lived near Fort Hunter when he first came to America and the stone house called Mount Johnson, in the area of modern Amsterdam, where he lived during the years 1742 to 1749. When Johnson moved on to Johnson Hall in 1763 (see johnstown), Fort Johnson was taken over by his son, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/sir-john-johnson">Sir John Johnson</a> (1749–1774).</p><p>It was during his years at Fort Johnson that Sir William won his baronetcy, gained further fame for his management of Indian affairs, and enlarged his personal estate. During the Seven Years' War (1754–1763) the house was fortified—a palisade was erected, artillery positions were built in the vicinity, and a small garrison was installed. The name Fort Johnson dates from this period. (The French had put a price on Johnson's head.)</p><p>Fort Johnson is now a museum maintained by the Montgomery County Historical Society. Phone: (518) 843-0300. Much of the interior woodwork is original, and the house is furnished with a number of pieces that belonged to Sir William. In the attic the hand-hewn, wood-pegged roof timbers are visible, and the construction discredits the myth that it supported a roof of lead sheets (allegedly melted by the Patriots for bullets); the best evidence appears to indicate that wooden shakes were used. Some authorities also challenge the theory that Sir William sent to London for this lead-sheet roofing, interior paneling, hardware, and other fittings and furnishings. But Fort Johnson does have the architectural distinction of departing from the Dutch tradition in the Mohawk Valley and being the first <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/ancient-history-middle-ages-and-feudalism/manor-house">manor house</a> of the English style in the region.</p><p>The house is open for tours Wednesday through Sunday from May to September.</p><h3><a id="FortKlockRestoration"><b>Fort Klock Restoration</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Klock Restoration,</b> N.Y. Route 5, is about 2 miles east of St. Johnsville. Of exceptional charm, architectural distinction, and appeal for the casual tourist as well as for serious historical conservationists, Fort Klock deserves to be better known. The large, L-shaped, fortified trading post was built on the bank of the Mohawk in 1750. Its native limestone walls are 2 feet thick and loopholed on all sides. One unique feature is a spring that still flows from the cellar's solid stone floor to form a large pool.</p><p>Fort Klock is one of the few surviving fur-trading centers in the Mohawk Valley, and its military and trade room displays a beaver skin, a bark canoe, and the goods that Johannes Klock used for barter. The equipment of colonial troops is also exhibited, reflecting the house's changed role when the Revolution came and its master at that time, John Klock, was on the Tryon County Committee of Safety. (The Klock family retained possession of its ancestral home for almost two centuries and held annual reunions there until recent years.)</p><p>Other restored and furnished rooms are a large dining room, a bedroom, and a spinning and weaving room. The kitchen has a sink made from native limestone and a door arrangement through which heavy logs for the fireplace could be dragged by a horse or ox. Several outbuildings have been restored on the site, including a schoolhouse, blacksmith shop, and Dutch barn, forming an attractive setting for the main house.</p><p>The Battle of Klock's Field took place on 19 October 1780 just east of Fort Klock. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/sir-john-johnson">Sir John Johnson</a>'s raiders had annihilated one Patriot force earlier in the day at Stone Arabia and were making their way from the present Nelliston westward along the King's Highway (now the railroad tracks). Late in the afternoon they were spotted by the pursuing militia force on the opposite bank of the Mohawk. While militia general Robert Van Rensselaer dined with Governor George Clinton at Fort Plain, his troops improvised a crossing and forced the enemy to turn and fight. Attacking at about sunset, the right flank units under Robert McKean and Chief Louis (with about sixty Oneidas) routed a jaeger company and some Indians under <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/north-american-indigenous-peoples-biographies/joseph-brant">Joseph Brant</a>, but the Loyalists and British regulars held their main position. Van Rensselaer refused to let his men renew the assault, and his officers subsequently charged him with incompetence. He was cleared by a court of inquiry.</p><p>Fort Klock was filled with neighborhood families during this action. One of the militia defenders dropped a British officer from the saddle with a long shot, the horse galloped up to the fort, and the officer's camp kettle became a Klock family heirloom.</p><p>Fort Klock is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday from May to October, and is maintained by the Fort Klock Historic Restoration Committee.

Old Fort Niagara is administered by the Old Fort Niagara Association. Phone: (716) 745-7273. The site is an approved National Historic Landmark in the area of French exploration and settlement. The fortified barracks built by the French in 1726 is the heart of the elaborately restored frontier fortress that figured prominently in four distinct periods of American history. This "French castle" is furnished in the period of the Seven Years' War. It includes the trade room, sleeping quarters, council chamber, military kitchen, prison, dungeon, Jesuit chapel, and gun deck. The "Gate of the Five Nations" features a drawbridge operated by chains, windlasses, and stone counterweights. The British redoubts of 1770 are stone blockhouses with walls 5 feet thick on which cannon are mounted. During the summer months costumed staff play the roles of the British garrison.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/sir-william-johnson">Sir William Johnson</a> temporarily assumed command of the British column advancing on Niagara when British General Prideaux was killed in action, and so he had the honor of receiving the surrender of the French post in 1759. During the Revolution, when Johnson's retainers and clansmen from the Mohawk Valley remained loyal to the crown, they used Niagara as their base for bloody raids back into their home territory. The British did not relinquish this post until 1796, thirteen years after the American Revolution ended. In 1813 they recaptured Niagara from the Americans, giving it up after the end of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/war-1812">War of 1812</a>.</p><p>The site is now visited by hundreds of thousands annually and has a particular charm for children.</p><h3><a id="FortOntario"><b>Fort Ontario</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Ontario,</b> 1 East Fourth Street, on <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-ontario">Lake Ontario</a> at the mouth of Oswego River, opposite the city of Oswego. Phone: (315) 343-4711. The name "Oswego" occurs often in Revolutionary War accounts of fighting on the northwestern frontier. Strategically located on the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/great-lakes">Great Lakes</a> waterway and at the end of the Mohawk Valley-Wood Creek-Lake Oneida-Oswego River route from the Hudson Valley at Albany, the British fort was the base for Loyalist-Indian raids into New York and the point of departure for St. Leger's abortive invasion of 1777. (See fort stanwix.) In modern Oswego, just across the river from Fort Ontario, is a stone monument marking the site of Fort Oswego, established by the British in 1726 to 1727 as protection for their fur agents. The Pontiac Boulder at West First and Oneida Streets marks the site of Pontiac's submission to Sir <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/william-johnson">William Johnson</a> in July 1765.</p><p>Fort Ontario State Historic Site preserves the ramparts of the fort built in 1755 about a quarter of a mile from the Fort Oswego just mentioned. Montcalm destroyed this new fort (1756); the British rebuilt it in 1759 and used it as a base for the capture of Fort Niagara and Montreal. But Oswego continued to be a frontier post. "Old" Walter Butler was Sir William Johnson's representative "at the difficult outpost at Oswego" in the early 1740s and was still there in the early 1750s, his sons being there with him much of the time. (See butlersbury.)</p><p>When the Mohawk Valley Loyalists were forced to flee in the summer of 1775, they went to Oswego and there made contact with the British authorities they would serve so well during the Revolution. In 1777 the British abandoned Fort Ontario, and the next year it was partially burned by Continental troops. In 1782 the British reoccupied the post and rebuilt its defenses, holding the fort until forced to leave in 1796 under the terms of the Jay Treaty.</p><p>In the War of 1812 the British captured Fort Ontario and demolished it. Work on restoring it was done during the periods 1839 to 1844 and 1863 to 1872, and in 1946 Fort Ontario became a State Historic Site. Most of the buildings a tourist sees there today are from 1839 to 1844, when the existing scarp wall and casements were built. But the ramparts are original. A museum depicts the ups and downs of Fort Ontario and this strategic site.

A fortification covering half an acre and built around a stone farmhouse in 1776, it was an important Patriot base during the Revolution. A raid by Joseph Brant in 1780 killed sixteen people in the village and took sixty prisoners. General Robert Van Rensselaer operated from Fort Plain later in 1780 while coping unsuccessfully with Sir John Johnson's raiders at Stone Arabia and Fort Klock. Colonel Marinus Willett had his valley headquarters here in 1781 to 1783, when the place was called Fort Rensselaer. From here he conducted some of the final, successful operations of the Revolution.

Colonel William ("Tangier") Smith, so called for his early career in the North African city of that name on the Strait of Gibraltar, came to America with his family in 1686. He acquired large holdings patented in 1693 as the Manor of St. George, and "Tangier" Smith subsequently became the first chief justice of New York. Soon after his death at the manor house near the first family burial ground in modern Setauket, a new manor house was built at Mastic.</p><p>When the British occupied Long Island in 1776 they fortified the new house by constructing a 90-foot-square earthwork on the higher ground a little over 100 feet to the west and building a stockade that incorporated this work, the manor house, and another structure. Three barracks within this stockade housed the garrison of Fort St. George.</p><p>This became an important British base, the earthwork commanding an inlet into Great South Bay (it survives only as the name of a Fire Island community, Old Inlet), and on the land side Fort St. George was a stronghold in a region where the British gathered valuable supplies (see long island).</p><p>In a predawn surprise attack on 23 November 1780 the fort fell quickly to a small force of Continental troops led by Major Benjamin Tallmadge. Having crossed the sound from Fairfield, Connecticut two days earlier and been delayed by a severe storm, the raiders destroyed much of the fort, seized a supply vessel, burned forage at Coram as they withdrew to their boats at <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/judaism/judaism/mount-sinai">Mount Sinai</a>, and returned to Fairfield with about two hundred prisoners. Tallmadge's only loss was one man wounded, and he received commendations from Washington and the Congress for his feat.</p><p>The Manor of St. George is now a 127-acre public park and museum, after having been in the Smith family for over 260 years. Eugenie Annie Tangier Smith, the last lineal descendant, died in 1954 and is buried near the manor house with many of those who shared her remarkable heritage. The existing house, a large frame structure, was built in 1810. It is the third on this location, and contains some furniture saved from the fire that destroyed its Revolutionary War predecessor. Part of the house is open to visitors. Thousands of original documents were preserved by the Smiths and were not generally available to scholars until after 1954. Among those exhibited in the museum room are a letter written by General Nathaniel Woodhull shortly before his death as a British prisoner, letters from Robert R. Livingston and George Clinton, and two deeds of 1691 signed by Indians.</p><p>The trace of the British fort (which may be on the site of one built two years earlier) was clearly revealed after a severe drought in 1957. Archaeologists have learned that grass has a distinctive growth pattern on topsoil that has been disturbed, and an aerial photograph taken in 1957 shows the outline of the fort.</p><p>As recently as 1928 one authority on Long Island historic homes was able to write that the Manor of St. George was still in a picturesque area of fields and forests little changed since the Revolution. It is now reduced to the status of a large park hemmed in by real-estate developments. The view over Great South Bay remains virtually unspoiled.

Here a 1-mile portage between the headwaters of the Mohawk River and Wood Creek made the site strategically important on the natural route between the upper Hudson Valley and the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/great-lakes">Great Lakes</a>. (See fort ontario.) It also was a frontier post where Iroquois and white leaders held several historic conferences. Starting in 1725 the British kept the site fortified, and in 1758 General John Stanwix built a fort to replace two earlier ones. With the French threat from Canada eliminated in the Seven Years' War, the British fort was abandoned in 1760. Eight years later Sir William Johnson met here with two thousand Indians to negotiate the famous Treaty of Fort Stanwix. In addition to strengthening the British alliance with the Iroquois, Sir William and the Indians agreed to a new boundary that opened vast areas of central New York, western Pennsylvania, and the future states of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/west-virginia">West Virginia</a> and Kentucky to white settlers. (The earlier Proclamation Line of 1763 is now followed by the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/blue-ridge">Blue Ridge</a> Parkway. See this heading under both north carolina and virginia.)</p><p>In June 1776 a detachment of Continental troops under Colonel Elias Dayton started rebuilding the fort. For a while it was called <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/fort-schuyler">Fort Schuyler</a>, but the older name clung, and the place continued to be known as Fort Stanwix.</p><p>In August 1777 Colonel Peter Gansevoort (1749–1812), a native of Albany and only twenty-eight years old at the time, defended Fort Stanwix with an exceptionally able second in command, Lieutenant Colonel Marinus Willett (1740–1830), and 550 troops. The besiegers under British Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger (1737–1789) numbered about 2,000; about half of these were Indians under Joseph Brant, another 350 were British and German regulars, and the rest were Loyalists and Canadian auxiliaries. Among the Loyalist units were Sir John Johnson's Royal Greens and Colonel John Butler's Rangers, most of them natives of the Mohawk Valley.</p><p>An American relief column was ambushed 5 miles short of Fort Stanwix at Oriskany and driven back, but this strategic victory for the British turned out to be the doom of St. Leger's operation. His Indian allies had been recruited with the understanding that they would have lots of looting and scalping but little if any serious fighting. Badly decimated at Oriskany, they came back to find that Willett had made a bold sortie with 250 men and systematically cleaned out the undefended camps of the Indians and the Loyalists.</p><p>Willett and another officer slipped out of the fort and reported to General Schuyler at Stillwater (about 11 miles below Saratoga) that Fort Stanwix could not hold out much longer without assistance. Benedict Arnold led eight hundred Continentals to the relief of Stanwix, and news of his approach was enough to send St. Leger's Indians packing. The British commander then had to accept the fact that his expedition was a failure and withdraw to Canada. The heroic defense of Fort Stanwix saved the Mohawk Valley from being invaded and contributed to the greater triumph at Saratoga (see saratoga national historical park).</p><p>A controversy has raged over whether the first <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/military-affairs-nonnaval/stars-and">Stars and Stripes</a> flown by ground forces in battle was raised over Fort Stanwix or someplace else. One positive historical gain from this regional controversy is that the Rome Historical Society has been active in bringing about the establishment of the Fort Stanwix National Monument. The National Parks Service reconstructed Fort Stanwix in the center of downtown Rome at the corner of North James Street and Erie Boulevard.

A highway marker at this point identifies the house built in 1750 by Peter Wagner (or Waggoner), Patriot leader and lieutenant colonel of the Palatine Regiment during the Revolution. Privately owned, the original, two-story stone house has a much larger and unattractive frame house built onto its eastern end. The 1750 house, though long empty and neglected, remains reasonably sound structurally, for the time being.</p><h3><a id="GardinersIsland"><b>Gardiner's Island</b> </a></h3><p><b>Gardiner's Island,</b> between the eastern forks of Long Island. An anchorage "where even the largest ships can ride out a storm," as Major Baurmeister of the Hessian forces reported to his superior in Hesse-Cassel (<i>Revolution in America</i>, p. 368), Gardiner's Bay and the island are mentioned frequently in naval operations of the Revolution. The place became particularly important for the British when the French fleet was at Newport. Robert David Lion Gardiner, sixteenth "lord of the manor" of Gardiner's Island, successfully fought efforts to turn it into a national monument; he died in 2004. Today the 3,300-acre island remains private and is an important breeding ground of the osprey, an <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/environmental-studies/endangered-species">endangered species</a>. Currently the family is divided between holding on to the island or deeding it to the Nature Conservancy or the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts-28">federal government</a>. Lion Gardiner, first owner of the manor, established in 1639, lies in the Old Burying Ground, East Hampton, Long Island.</p><h3><a id="GermanFlats"><b>German Flats</b> </a></h3><p><b>German Flats,</b> Mohawk Valley. This designation is usually applied to the entire 10-mile stretch of Palatine settlements that extended, generally on the south side of the Mohawk, to the place now called Herkimer. The latter was the site of Fort Herkimer, erected in the early part of the Seven Years' War and rebuilt in 1776 to 1777 as Fort Dayton. (Two miles to the east was the Fort Herkimer Church of the Revolution.) Some old maps limit the name German Flats (spelled "Flatts" in the original documents) to the spot that is now Herkimer.</p><p>The principal reason for encouraging the settlement of Palatines in this region was to provide a buffer against the Iroquois west of the more heavily populated, eastern portion of the Mohawk Valley. German Flats consequently got more than its share of attention from the Indians and Loyalists during the Revolution. The most devastating raid came in September 1778 (authorities disagree as to the precise day), when Joseph Brant and Captain William Caldwell moved against the settlements from Unadilla with 450 Indians and Loyalists. Lieutenant Adam F. Helmer was the sole survivor of a four-man reconnaissance patrol sent out to watch for the expected raid.</p><p>A highway marker on N.Y. Route 5S just west of the Shoemaker House indicates where Helmer entered the valley to spread the warning, and a plaque on a boulder at Fort Herkimer Church commemorates this hero. (Walter D. Edmonds has immortalized this American marathon in the novel <i>Drums Along the Mohawk</i>.) The settlers had time to gather for protection at Fort Dayton and Fort Herkimer Church. The raiders spared women and children and killed only three men, but inflicted tremendous property damage. Colonel Peter Bellinger said in his report that 63 homes, 57 barns, and 4 mills were burned by the enemy and more than 700 head of livestock captured.</p><p>German Flats was raided again in the fall of 1780 when Sir John Johnson withdrew up the valley from his operations in the Schoharie Valley. Small bands of Indians destroyed property in the settlement in early 1781. On 6 August 1781 the settlement of Shell's Bush, 5 miles north of Fort Dayton, was surprised by sixty Indians and Loyalists under Donald McDonald. Most of the Patriots, who had been working in the fields, ran for Fort Dayton, but John Christian Shell (or Schell) made it to his blockhouse with his wife and six sons. They suffered no casualties in successfully defending their position against a determined enemy attack, and McDonald was dragged inside and taken prisoner as he tried to force the door with a crowbar.</p><h3><a id="Glen-SandersHouse"><b>Glen-Sanders House</b> </a></h3><p><b>Glen-Sanders House</b> (Glen Sanders Mansion, Scotia Mansion), just across the Mohawk River from the Schenectady Stockade in Scotia, on N.Y. 5. Erected in 1713 using stone and other material from a house built in 1658 nearer the river, this large historic structure has recently been restored after having been vacant for many years. Its furnishings were moved long ago to <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/colonial">Colonial Williamsburg</a>, Virginia. The historic mansion was originally the home of Alexander Glen, a Scot who bought land here in 1655 and became the first permanent white settler in the Mohawk Valley. Because of Glen's enlightened policies toward the Indians, his house was spared by French and Indian raiders. Scotia was the name Glen gave the settlement in the seventeenth century, and it survives as the name of this suburb of Schenectady.</p><p>The Glen Sanders Mansion, as it is now called, has had several additions to the original structure and is an upscale restaurant inn. It is plainly visible at the western end of the Great Western Gateway Bridge at 1 Glen Avenue.

The best landmark to watch for here is the lock of the state barge canal. Sir William Johnson built a frame house here in 1766 for his daughter Mary and her husband, Guy Johnson, a nephew of Sir William. This burned in 1774, and the central section of the present stone house was built that same year. Guy succeeded his father-in-law as superintendent of Indian affairs on Sir William's death in July 1774, and exactly a year later fled to Canada with about two hundred Rangers and some Indians; he lived in Guy Park only five months. Colonel Guy Johnson was successful in winning all but two tribes of the Iroquois, the Oneidas and Tuscaroras, entirely to the British side at the outbreak of the Revolution. He has been described as "a short, pursy man, of stern countenance and haughty demeanor." Much more the politician than the field soldier, he spent almost two years with the British army around New York City and then operated from Niagara without personally accompanying any of the raiding parties sent out from there. (He was not at the Battle of Newtown [see newtown battlefield state park], as some authorities have said.) In March 1782 he was succeeded by Sir John Johnson as superintendent general and inspector general of the Six Nations. After the war he went to England, where he died at about forty-eight years of age.</p><p>Guy Park lost much of its Georgian character in 1848 when the roof and cornice were reconstructed, and most of the interior woodwork dates probably from this remodeling. Ten years later the massive central section was given two-story wings, and Guy Park does not meet the criteria for selection as a National Historic Landmark. It is, however, a state-owned historic site, and it houses the current office of the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce. It is open on weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Phone: (518) 842-8200.</p><p>A highway marker on N.Y. 5 just west of Guy Park says that the Daniel Claus House was nearby. (Its site is about a mile west of Guy Park.) Claus was the other son-in-law of Sir William. He and Ann lived in the stone house on the bank of the Mohawk that had been Sir William's home during the years 1742 to 1749; they called the place Williamsburg during their occupancy. (This structure survived in ruins until the 1920s; no trace now remains.)</p><h3><a id="HaynesLemuelHouse"><b>Haynes (Lemuel) House</b> </a></h3><p><b>Haynes (Lemuel) House,</b> South Granville. Home of one of the most prominent <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/african-americans">African Americans</a> of the early republic, this house is on the National Register of Historic Places. Haynes, born in 1753 to a black father and white mother, was indentured as a servant until the age of twenty-one. Demonstrating a precocious intelligence, Haynes became a popular lay sermonizer while still a teenager. He served in the Massachusetts militia during the Revolution, seeing action during the siege of Boston. Near the end of the Revolution he was called to the Middle Granville Congregational Church, becoming probably the first black minister of a predominately white congregation in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/united-states">United States</a>. In 1785 he became the first known ordained African American minister when the Congregational Church recognized his calling. He served mostly white congregations for the next forty years in Connecticut and Vermont, becoming a well-known poet, abolitionist, and Federalist. In 1822 he moved to South Granville and served as minister of the Congregational Church there until his death in 1833. The house is still a private residence, but visitors are welcome to drive by Parker Hill Road off of N.Y. 149; the Haynes House is the second on the right.</p><h3><b>Herkimer</b></h3><p><b>Herkimer,</b> Mohawk Valley. <i>See</i>fort dayton site.</p><h3><a id="HerkimerHome"><b>Herkimer Home</b> </a></h3><p><b>Herkimer Home,</b> 200 State Route 169, Little Falls, Mohawk Valley on N.Y. 5S, 3 miles east of Little Falls between Thruway Exits 29 and 30. Descriptive literature and photographs cannot do justice to this site. Should you come into great wealth and want to build a family mansion, by all means see this one before you get too far along with your plans.</p><p>Nicholas Herkimer (1728–1777) was to the Patriot element of the Mohawk Valley what Sir William Johnson's heirs were to the Loyalists. He was born near the present town of Herkimer a few years after his family came to America from the Rhenish Palatinate of modern Germany. By the start of the Revolution he had become the most successful landowner in the Mohawk Valley. The term "farmer-trader" is sometimes used to describe his occupation. Perhaps this is as close as modern Americans can come in tagging Herkimer, but he personally did little farming, and "trader" hardly connotes the large scope of his entrepreneurial activities.</p><p>When the Revolution came to the Mohawk Valley and the Johnsons and Butlers took refuge in Canada, Nicholas Herkimer emerged as the most powerful figure in the Whig leadership. His support naturally was strongest among the Palatines in German Flats. In July 1777, as general of the local militia, Herkimer led about four hundred troops to Unadilla for a conference with former neighbor Joseph Brant (see indian castle church). This chief of the Mohawks had temporarily fallen out with Guy Johnson, Sir William's successor as superintendent of Indian affairs, and was in a mood to bargain with the Patriots. But the conference failed, and only Herkimer's cool handling of the situation kept it from degenerating into a battle.</p><p>Later in the year, when he led the militia to the relief of Fort Stanwix, General Herkimer's better judgment was shaken by the dissension of impetuous subordinates. His patriotism as well as his martial ardor assailed by these lesser men, Herkimer put himself at the head of the column and marched into a skillfully planned ambuscade. Then, despite a shattered thigh, he personally directed the defensive battle that eventually saved his force from total annihilation at Oriskany. Eleven days later, after an ineptly performed amputation, he called for the family Bible, read to his assembled family in a clear voice, and died. He is buried in the family cemetery adjoining the home.</p><p>There is no other mansion in the Mohawk Valley that so typifies the Germanic style as does this structure. The wide central hall of the two-story brick house is typical of the colonial architecture one finds in all regions. Also typical are the two rooms on one side of this hall. But the German influence is seen on the other side of the central hall, upstairs as well as downstairs, where instead of the expected two rooms are single rooms running the depth of the house. Centered in the outside wall is a large fireplace, built shallow to reflect the maximum heat. The great hall on the ground floor was what we might tritely call the family room today, and the corresponding chamber upstairs was the guest room. The inside dimensions of this room, if one allows for the 2-foot thickness of the outer walls, are about 36 by 23 feet.</p><p>Native pine paneling in this house gives a mellow feeling that is lacking in the more elegant colonial mansions of the Georgian style. Dragon's blood stain on the upper floor paneling is as vivid as when it was applied more than two centuries ago.</p><p>General Herkimer built this house in 1764 on land given to him by his father, but it did not remain in the family long after his death. The <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/erie-canal">Erie Canal</a> was dug through the backyard of the house, and one owner converted the house into a tavern. Partitions were slapped up to make three rooms out of those great chambers, plaster was smeared on the paneling, and all sorts of other disfigurations were made in the name of commercial enterprise. Then a railroad was put through the backyard, and the tavern keeper went out of business. Now the canal has been filled in and the tracks are silent. The New York State Historic Trust has restored the Herkimer Home and developed the 160-acre tract that surrounds it.</p><p>The site is open mid-May through October, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.

Behind it, on slightly higher ground and also visible from the highway, are the graves of many Mohawks and several early white settlers.</p><p>The church is on the site of Upper Castle, largest of the last three Castles of the Mohawk Indians and home of Sir William Johnson's principal Indian ally, King Hendrick, uncle of Joseph and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/molly-brant">Molly Brant</a>. Legend has it that Molly started her liaison with Sir William here, but this is not documented. It is known, however, that she returned to the village after his death in 1774. In August 1777 Molly sent her brother Joseph the intelligence that brought about the Battle of Oriskany. A month later she fled to Canada.</p><p>Joseph Brant contributed the land and Sir William put up the money for the church. The entire bill of materials is carefully itemized in the published papers of Sir William. In addition to the timber, stone, nails, paint, plastering, miscellaneous hardware, and a church bell, 80 gallons of rum were budgeted for the project. But the early-American programmers proved to be as fallible as their counterparts today, and an additional 10 gallons and 3 quarts of rum had to be furnished before the job was completed (<i>Sir William Johnson Papers</i>, VII, pp. 666-668).</p><p>Indian Castle Church is the only surviving structure of the Mohawk Castles.

Established in 1760 by Sir William Johnson (1715–1774) as the capital of his vast frontier domain, Johnstown has many important landmarks of the colonial and Revolutionary era.</p><p>William Johnson, first baronet of New York, reached the Mohawk Valley in 1737 at the age of twenty-two to manage the estate of his uncle. He quickly revealed talents that made him an outstanding frontier leader. In 1755 all five of the colonies sending troops to northern New York for the expedition against Crown Point commissioned him a major general. At <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-george">Lake George</a> he defeated a force of French professionals and Indians and was made a hereditary baronet of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/british-empire">British Empire</a>. General Sir William Johnson succeeded to command of the expedition that took Fort Niagara in 1759, and the next year aided Amherst in taking Montreal. As superintendent of Indian affairs north of the Ohio and colonel of the Six Nations, he kept the Iroquois from joining Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763, and negotiated the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.</p><p>For about the last ten years of his life Sir William was in ill health, and in 1774 he died suddenly at Johnson Hall a few hours after making a long address at an Indian council there. Only fifty-nine years old at this time, he left three children from his union in 1739 with a seventeen-year-old indentured servant named Catharine Weisenburg. These children—Ann, John, and Mary—were baptized in their mother's name. But Sir William refers to her in his will as "my beloved wife," a wedding ring engraved with the date "1739 June 26" was found in his grave, and the College of Heralds—which is quite particular in matters of legitimacy—recognized his son John's title as second baronet of New York.</p><p>Sir William had eight children by the first of his two "Indian wives" who moved into Johnson Hall after Catharine's death, and in maintaining the intimate relations with the Iroquois for which his services to the crown were so valuable, he undoubtedly sired others. But when his reputation as a "squaw man" became bruited about the coffeehouses of London and prompted an official inquiry, he replied simply that the rumors of his numerous progeny had been grossly exaggerated. (The first "housekeeper" was the famous Mary, or "Molly," Brant, sister of the noted Mohawk Joseph Brant.)</p><p>Although Sir William had been dead a year when the American Revolution came to the Mohawk Valley, his dynasty remained a strong Loyalist force. His son had inherited the title and the wealth. His two daughters had married Sir William's principal lieutenants, kinsman Guy Johnson and Daniel Claus. The two Indian mistresses were nieces of Chief Hendrick of the Mohawks, a circumstance which gave the Johnsons "dynastic" ties with the Iroquois. Hundreds of Highland Scots brought to settle Sir William's domain were a further source of Loyalist support.</p><p>In the summer of 1775 the principal Loyalists of the valley left for Canada to join the British and organize themselves to reestablish loyal government along the Mohawk by force of arms. Sir John Johnson (1742–1830) had to stay behind temporarily. For one thing, his wife was expecting a baby. Also, Sir John had duties to perform as a judge and as major general of the militia. When the Patriots learned that he was in correspondence with Royal Governor Tryon and was arming his retainers, they marched to Johnson Hall (January 1776) for a showdown. General Philip Schuyler forced Johnson to disband his personal army, to give up three Highlanders as hostages, and to put himself on parole to await orders from Congress. About four months later, after his life had been threatened, Johnson buried his family silver in the cellar of Johnson Hall, his papers in another place, and fled with 170 of his tenants to Montreal, abandoning his wife and the hostages.</p><p>The first and greatest battle between the Loyalist exiles and their Mohawk Valley kinsmen and former neighbors was at Oriskany in August 1777. The next spring Sir John led a raid that took the Johnstown settlements by surprise. With four hundred Loyalist Rangers and two hundred Indians under Joseph Brant he had sailed up Lake Champlain to Crown Point, had gone up Lake George, and then had marched overland to continue up the Sacandaga River (now a great reservoir). Killing, burning, taking prisoners, and evacuating families of his Loyalist officers, Johnson destroyed much of Johnstown, and Brant's Indians raided as far south as the Mohawk. After five days, and without meeting the expected Patriot attack, Johnson retraced his steps to Crown Point.</p><p>On this first raid Sir John recovered his papers and silver, forty-two pieces of the latter being entrusted to as many of his soldiers and all arriving safely. All but four pieces of the Johnson silver were later put aboard a ship for England and lost in a storm. Sir Colpoys Johnson, the eighth baronet of New York, has a small bowl and salver from this salvaged collection. Sir John's recovered papers had been ruined by dampness.</p><p>In the fall of 1780 Johnson and Brant joined forces at Unadilla to ravage the Schoharie Valley. They descended to Fort Hunter and laid waste settlements on both sides of the Mohawk as far up as Fort Plain before the Patriots were able to muster any effective resistance. On 19 October there was fighting in Stone Arabia and near Fort Klock. The raiders then withdrew safely westward to Onondaga Lake (at modern Syracuse) and continued to the site of Fort Ontario.</p><p>The Battle of Johnstown was fought on 25 October 1781. Joseph Brant had been ravaging the upper Mohawk since the early part of that year, and in October a force of 570 Loyalists and 130 Indians under Major <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/north-american-indigenous-peoples-biographies/john-ross">John Ross</a> had raided to within 12 miles of Schenectady without meeting any real resistance. Sir John was supposed to invade the valley from the direction of Crown Point, but Ross decided to withdraw to Johnstown when this support did not materialize. Colonel Marinus Willett commanded the militia that followed Ross. The weather had been bad for several days, and troops on both sides were tired and wet when the battle started about midafternoon on a dark and gloomy day. The British line was formed generally along the present Johnson Avenue, near Johnson Hall. The Patriots attacked from the southeast, their base being the fortified jail that still stands on South Perry Street. In the early phase of the battle, Patriot militia broke under the attack of Ross's Indians, some seventeen being killed as they tried to escape across Cayadutta Creek near Johnson Hall, and others not stopping until they reached the safety of Old St. John's Church and Fort Johnstown (the stockaded jail). The enemy line then stood fast against an attempt by a reinforcement of one hundred Massachusetts levies to envelop it from the hill about 500 yards to the northeast of Johnson Hall. Ross then maneuvered to counterattack, capturing a small cannon and stripping its ammunition before it could be retaken, and probably would have annihilated the Patriot force if darkness had not fallen early that day.</p><p>Foolish claims have been made that the Revolution already was over because Cornwallis had surrendered a few days earlier at Yorktown and that the Battle of Johnstown was fought only because the news had not arrived there. Although there were no more major military operations, the Revolution lasted for two more years.</p><p>Today's visitor to Revolutionary War sites in the Mohawk Valley will find historic Johnstown a good place to establish a base for several days. The glove factories, textile mills, and other modern commercial enterprises have made Johnstown and adjoining Gloversville an unattractive specimen of urban development, but the informed sightseer will find more here than he can properly appreciate in a short visit. The following attractions, starting with one of our most important and interesting national landmarks, are all within walking distance in today's Johnstown.</p><p><b><i>Johnson Hall</i></b> State Historical Site. On Johnson Avenue just north of its junction with West State Street (N.Y. 29). Completely restored and authentically furnished by state authorities, this white frame mansion stands in a wooded park of some 19 acres. Guided tours are provided May through October. Phone: (518) 762-8712.</p><p>Giving nearby Fort Johnson to his son, Sir William built Johnson Hall in 1763. The two-story structure of Georgian Colonial style has a full basement, where the kitchen is located, and an attic. Wooden blocks grooved to simulate stone are used for the siding, as in the central section of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/mount-vernon">Mount Vernon</a>. Samuel Fuller, builder of several other well-known landmarks in the Mohawk Valley, gave Johnson Hall particularly handsome architectural touches in its rooflines, heavy dentiled cornices under the eaves (those added over the windows have, fortunately, been removed), and in the finely detailed little entrance porch.</p><p>The floor plan follows the tradition of large central halls upstairs and down, with two rooms on each side. Sir William's study, where he died, is at the head of the cellar stairs on the ground floor, and above it is "Molly Brant's Room." The gigantic upper hall is reproduced in a delightful animated model in the basement museum depicting "a musical evening at Johnson Hall in 1772." With taped music of the period and narrative, the visitor sees Sir William and an assortment of guests playing various instruments as the "faithful housekeeper" Molly Brant sits surrounded by young children. At one point a door opens slightly and briefly to reveal the grinning faces of children in their nightclothes.</p><p>The two stone blockhouses were built in 1764 not only for defense but also to provide additional quarters, storage space, office, and study. Only one is original, and it was connected by a narrow underground passageway to the basement. In 1855 this tunnel had to be filled in because it was a safety hazard.</p><p>A scale model of the entire complex of buildings around Johnson Hall in Sir William's day is among the exhibits in the blockhouse. A large council house (30 by 100 feet) stood about 300 yards west-southwest of the mansion. The much-reproduced painting by E. L. Henry in 1903 of an Indian council being held between the blockhouses on the back steps of Johnson Hall is wrong in this last detail (although accurate in architectural matters). The painter also has western Indians in his picture, not Sir William's Iroquois.</p><p><b><i>Lost Grave of Sir William Johnson</i>.</b> A large stone behind new St. John's Church in the center of Johnstown marks the rediscovered grave of the city's founder. He had built St. John's on this site in 1772, and two years later his body was laid to rest beneath the chancel floor. In 1836 the old church burned, and in 1840 the new St. John's was built in a slightly different location. The grave was rediscovered by accident (this same year, 1840), somebody having noticed that dirt kicked into a small hole in the surface of the ground here disappeared into a cavity below. The local Masonic lodge, which Sir William had founded, recovered the remains and reburied them in 1866.</p><p>One item of particular historic interest came to light at this time: on Sir William's finger was a wedding ring engraved with the date "1739 June 26." It was a woman's ring enlarged to fit his finger, and the date is that of his union with Catharine Weisenburg. This ring disappeared in 1964, was rediscovered in 1971 (in a Bennington, Vermont, warehouse), and is now exhibited in the cellar museum of Johnson Hall. The search continues for Catharine's grave and her marriage license.</p><p>Another item found in Sir William's grave was the lead ball carried in his left hip from his victory at Lake George. It is privately owned and not on exhibit.</p><p><b><i>Tryon County Courthouse</i>.</b> In the center of the city (West Main between Melcher and William Streets) is the colonial courthouse built in 1772 and still in use. Johnstown became a county seat in this year, and until then the village had comprised only about a dozen houses located a mile away from Johnson Hall. The opening of the first term of court was announced by ringing an improvised device in the cupola that has never been replaced: a large bar of iron bent to form a triangle. The courthouse is a low structure of brick with an interesting cupola. Except for one four-year period, it has been in constant use as a courthouse. Among those said to have argued cases there are Alexander Hamilton and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/aaron-burr">Aaron Burr</a>, but this is not documented.</p><p><b><i>Other Historic Sites</i>.</b> The Colonial Cemetery on West Green Street contains the graves of Revolutionary War veterans. Fort Johnstown, now the county jail, was built by Sir William in 1772 and fortified by a stockade and two blockhouses; Washington inspected it in 1783. Burke's Tavern, at West Montgomery and South William Streets, was moved to this location in 1788 and is used by the DAR for meetings; it is almost a duplicate of the Miller House in White Plains. The site of Johnson's Free School (1764) is on West Main Street between Market and William Streets. The Drumm House at the intersection of State, William, and Green Streets, near the Colonial Cemetery, is erroneously identified by a state marker as dating from 1763 and being the home of schoolmaster Edward Wall (or Wahl). On this lot was a small frame building used as a church before Old St. John's was built (1772). An official map of 1784 shows an empty lot here, and the Drumm House, moved onto the lot in 1840, has no historical significance other than as an illustration of mythmaking.</p><p>St. Patrick's Lodge, No. 4, Free and Accepted Masons, now housed in the Masonic Temple built in 1925 on Perry between East Main and East Green Streets, was founded by Sir William in 1766. The silver jewelry insignia of the officers, furnished by Sir William, are still in the possession of the lodge; those taken away by Sir John when he fled to Canada in 1776 were returned after his death in 1830.</p><p>For further information on guided and self-guided tours of Johnstown, contact the following: Fulton County Regional Chamber of Commerce, phone: (518) 725-0641; Bob Gould, phone: (518) 762-8309; the Johnstown Historical Society, 17 North William Street, phone: (518) 762-7076.

No structures have been preserved, but a good view of the site is provided at Stony Point.</p><h3><a id="Kingston"><b>Kingston</b> </a></h3><p><b>Kingston.</b> Here at the principal rendezvous of the Esopus Indians, a fort was established by Dutch traders in 1615. Settlers from Albany arrived in 1653 to live near the protection of Fort Esopus, and in 1661 their village was chartered as Wiltwyck. The present name was bestowed in 1669 by the English governor in honor of his family home in Berkshire. Having had serious Indian troubles from the start, Kingston was a particular target of Indian and Loyalist raids in the early years of the Revolution because it was a center of Patriot sentiment in a region where Loyalism was strong. On the other hand, Kingston became notorious as a Loyalist prison.</p><p>During the period 19 February to 7 October 1777 the New York provincial government met at Kingston, having fled ahead of the British invaders from Manhattan to White Plains to Fishkill. At Kingston the first state constitution, primarily the work of John Jay, was adopted and the first state officials took office. General George Clinton was inaugurated as governor in the courthouse on whose site the present Ulster County Courthouse was built in 1818, and he is buried with other Revolutionary War veterans in the graveyard adjoining the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/protestant-denominations/dutch-reformed-church">Dutch Reformed Church</a>.</p><p>The Senate House, at Clinton Avenue and North Front Street, is the important historic landmark in Kingston. It is a one-story house of rock-cut limestone with a rear wall of Holland brick, built about 1676 by Colonel Wessel Ten Broeck. Around 1751 it was acquired by Abraham Van Gaasbeek, who made the south room available to the newly elected state senate. Reconstructed after the British raid on 16 October 1777 (see below), the house continued to be a residence until acquired by the state in 1887 from the Ten Broeck family. Now open year-round to the public from April through October (Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.), it is furnished with items of the colonial period that belonged to early settlers in the region. The adjoining museum (built in 1927) is devoted to regional history and features the paintings of Kingston's <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/john-vanderlyn">John Vanderlyn</a> (1775–1852). Phone: (845) 338-2786.</p><p>The British sailed up the Hudson after defeating George Clinton in the vicinity of Bear Mountain, and on 16 October 1777 burned almost every building in Kingston. The government fled to nearby Marbletown and then to Hurley, but the Council of Safety had been meeting in the Conrad Elmendorf Tavern, which survives at 88 Maiden Lane as a privately owned structure. The only house to be entirely spared by the British, the Van Steenbergh House, has survived at <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a> facing Franklin Street, and is also a private home.

The short portage to the north into Lake Champlain was dominated by Ticonderoga. From the southern end of the lake, now Lake George Village, the Great Carrying Place extended over about 10 miles to Fort Edward on the Hudson River.</p><p>In December 1775 the "Noble Train of Artillery" started south from Ticonderoga along Lake George on its 300-mile trip to the Boston lines. In 1777 Burgoyne made the serious mistake of not using Lake George as the route for his entire invasion force. Instead he sent only his heavy artillery and supplies along the lake, and moved the rest of his expedition from Whitehall (then Skenesboro) along Wood Creek to Fort Edward. The distance was only 22 miles, but the Patriots so obstructed his way that he took twenty days to make the trip.</p><p>Two months later the Americans attacked Burgoyne's overextended line of communications. Colonel <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-brown">John Brown</a> had some success in a surprise attack on Ticonderoga; then he moved south on Lake George in captured boats to surprise the British post at Diamond Island. Unfavorable winds slowed his advance, a paroled Loyalist warned the enemy of his approach, and Brown lacked the artillery firepower to attack the British breastworks, so he withdrew after a short bombardment of the island. Located south of Diamond Point and about 3 miles above Lake George Village, Diamond Island is now owned by the state and has a large stone monument dedicated to the armies that passed by between 1666 and 1777.</p><p>The Lake George Association was organized in 1885 to protect the lake's natural state, and what <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/thomas-jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> called "the most beautiful body of water I ever saw" remains remarkably unspoiled.

In September 1755 William Johnson won his baronetcy (becoming Sir William) by defeating French baron Dieskau. Two days after winning this Battle of Lake George Johnson established <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/fort-william-henry">Fort William Henry</a> a short distance away to control the portage between the lake and the Hudson River. In March 1757 the new fort easily beat off a French attack, but five months later the garrison surrendered after holding out for almost a week against a well-organized and much larger force under Montcalm. Many hundreds of the Americans were massacred when Montcalm's Indians got out of control and violated the French leader's honorable surrender terms.</p><p>The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/fort-william-henry">Fort William Henry</a> Corporation (phone: [518] 668-3081), formed in 1953, has reconstructed the fort. A museum displays objects found in archaeological investigations, and there are exhibits with taped explanations. Guided tours, military drills, musket and cannon firing, bullet molding, and the hourly showing of a thirty-minute film, <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>, are among the daily attractions during the summer season.

The site of Fort Gage is more difficult to find. It figures in literature of the Seven Years' War (young General Lord George Howe was there just before his death), it is plotted on the U.S. Geological Survey map of the region (Glens Falls quadrangle, 1:62,500), and it is identified in the WPA <i>Guide</i> as "Fort Gage Park." But the fort was never more than a fieldwork and was only very briefly occupied, and now there is nothing to find in the ground and not much more to see. The location is the sandy hill behind cabin number 7 of the Fort Gage Motel, just west of U.S. 9 at its junction with U.S. 9N (0.9 mile south of the entrance to Fort William Henry). Within living memory it has never been part of a park.</p><p>Bloody Pond is alongside U.S. 9 on the east, just 1.4 miles south of the Fort Gage site (junction of U.S. 9N) and about 3 miles south of the village of Lake George. It is 0.4 mile past Bloody Pond Road (do not be diverted by this promising name). There is a marker noting the pond's name with the date 1755 listed on it. The pond fills to an impressive size—about an acre—during the rainy season, but much of the time it is a stagnant puddle. Digging during a drought failed to reveal evidence that it had been filled with the bodies of men killed in the "Bloody Morning Scout" (see below).</p><p>Slightly more than a mile farther south on U.S. 9 is the grave of Colonel Ephraim Williams, just west of the highway. He and the elderly Chief Hendrick were killed in an ambuscade near this point the morning of Johnson's victory at Lake George. His will, made shortly before he led his regiment to join Johnson, left his property to a township on condition that its name be changed to Williamstown and a free school be established. The latter (in 1793) became Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts.</p><p>One of the handsome bronze markers indicating the route of Knox's "Noble Train of Artillery" from Ticonderoga to the Boston area is west of the highway, about midway between Bloody Pond and Williams's grave.</p><p>See lake george for other related sites.</p><h3><b>Livingston Manor</b></h3><p><b>Livingston Manor.</b> <i>See</i>clermont.</p><h3><a id="LongIsland"><b>Long Island</b> </a></h3><p><b>Long Island.</b> The western end of the 120-mile-long island settled in 1636 by Dutch farmers is part of New York City, and the Revolutionary War sites in Brooklyn (Kings County) and Queens boroughs are listed under the former heading.</p><p>The British controlled the entire island after their victory on 27 August 1776 over the Patriot army in what is known generally as the Battle of Long Island but should perhaps be called the Battle of Brooklyn. Long Island was an important source of supplies for the British—cattle, vegetables, hay, salt, and firewood—and the numerous windmills (several of which survive) were commandeered for grinding grain and pumping water. The island was also an important base for amphibious raids across Long Island Sound into Connecticut and for naval operations (see gardiner's island). Active Patriot operations on the island, "whaleboat warfare" in the Sound, dramatic intelligence work centered around Raynham Hall, and the highly successful Patriot raids to Fort St. George and Sag Harbor are remembered today by the physical remains at many historic landmarks.</p><p>The cultural and architectural treasures of Long Island deserve special notice. Many are in a remarkably fine state of preservation; others are disappearing as these words are written. The region is unusual also in that its historic and preservationist organizations have been especially effective. The Long Island Historical Society (in Brooklyn; see under new york city) and Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities (in Setauket; see end of this section) have long been venerated by Americans with a serious interest in our heritage. Because up-to-date information on historic sites on Long Island is available from these organizations, the author will here identify only the major landmarks.</p><p>The town of Southold covers most of the north fork at the top of Long Island. As the earliest settled portion of the island it is rich in structures of great architectural importance, although many are badly neglected. At the far tip of the island (and a longer drive than it might appear) is Orient Point. Conspicuous near the ferry slip is the great ghost of the Orient Point Inn, used by British troops during the Revolution and (expanded and raised to four stories) as a famous hotel until 1967. Gardiner's Island and Bay may be seen from this area. The ferry trip from Orient Point to New London, Connecticut can be enjoyable and historically profitable in conveying an impression of what Long Island Sound might have been like in the days of "whaleboat warfare" and British raids along the Connecticut coast.

On a hill overlooking this ancient crossing place is an attractive historical park preserving landmarks of the battlefield where a Patriot force was wiped out on 22 July 1779. Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant had retreated toward the ford with captured cattle, booty, and a few prisoners after raiding the village of Minisink, about 25 miles to the east. His 90 Indians and Loyalists were pursued by 150 militia, most of them from around Goshen. The impetuous Patriots had divided their force, sending an advance party ahead to cut the raiders off at the ford, when they discovered that Brant had safely crossed the river and circled back to cut off their retreat to Goshen. Brant skillfully set up an ambush, cut off a third of the Patriot force from the main body on the hill, and then attacked the latter with superior strength. Around dusk, when the defenders were running out of ammunition, Brant found a weak point and penetrated their position. In the massacre that followed, forty-five Goshen men and a number of others were killed.</p><p>In an attractive area developed by the Sullivan County Division of Public Works are marked the two places where the critical action took place at the end of the battle. From a large parking and picnic area a visitor climbs a paved path for about 100 yards to a small plateau where an interesting monument to the battle was erected in 1830. A recorded narrative is provided. About 100 yards to the southwest is a large boulder, "Sentinel Rock," where the Indians made their breakthrough. (Brant saw that the Patriot defender of this point had been killed, and he exploited the opportunity.) About 100 yards west of the old monument is a ledge called Hospital Rock, where Lieutenant Colonel (Doctor) Benjamin Tusten and seventeen other wounded were slaughtered.

If approaching on N.Y. 97 from the east, continue past the junction of the Old Minisink Ford Road to the junction of Route 168, just mentioned. (The old road is passable and picturesque, joining Route 168 about 0.1 mile from N.Y. 97 and 0.7 mile below the park entrance.)</p><p>N.Y. 97 is along the general trace of the historic Old Mine Road that was built by early colonists along the Minisink Indian route from the Hudson River (around Kingston) to the Delaware (at Port Jervis), then up the Delaware through Minisink Ford and the Delaware Water Gap. The name "Old Mine Road" comes from legends that Dutch prospectors from the Hudson Valley used it to reach copper and silver deposits in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a>. It may have the distinction of being the first Indian trail on the east coast to evolve into a true road; by 1756 it was traveled by wagons and stagecoaches.

Washington made Continental troops available for this operation. Major General John Sullivan was selected to lead the expedition, and his orders from Washington were brutal: "total destruction and devastation" of the Iroquois settlements and "the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible" to be held as hostages for future good behavior of the surviving Indians.</p><p>In accordance with the strategic plan, Sullivan's 2,500 troops were joined at Tioga (now Athens, Pennsylvania) by 1,500 who had come south under Brigadier General James Clinton from the Mohawk Valley.</p><p>Against the advice of Walter Butler the Indians insisted on making a stand at Newtown, which was only some 15 miles up the Chemung River from the starting point of Sullivan's expedition at Tioga. But here the Indians had found a good place for an ambuscade, and they made elaborate preparations, taking advantage of the time provided by Sullivan's dilatory efforts to get his expedition moving. An elaborately camouflaged breastwork of logs was built along a ridge parallel to the river. Its left flank was anchored on the slope of a steep hill, and the right flank was protected by a defile. After delivering a devastating surprise fire from this position, the defenders planned to sally forth from both flanks and annihilate the Rebel column.</p><p>At about 11 a.m. Sullivan's advance guard approached Newtown, and the Virginia riflemen of Dan Morgan's Rangers detected the trap. Morgan's three companies of riflemen were attached to the veteran brigade of General Enoch Poor, and these troops worked their way skillfully through difficult terrain onto the hill the Indians thought would protect their left flank. They were followed by Clinton's division. The Rebel artillery meanwhile took up a position to enfilade the enemy breastworks—that is, to deliver a sweeping fire from one end to the other. The guns opened up and Poor's reinforced brigade charged with the bayonet at about the same time, throwing the defenders into confusion and causing a great many of the Indians to flee in panic. The Loyalists, the fifteen regulars of the British Eighth Regiment, and many of Brant's Indians put up a determined defense, however. Colonel John Reid's Second New Hampshire Regiment on the flank of Poor's column was hit on three sides by a counterattack that would have wiped it out if Colonel Henry Dearborn had not turned back with his Third New Hampshire Regiment and two of Clinton's New York regiments to support Reid.</p><p>While this was going on, the brigades of General William Maxwell and Edward Hand, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> and Pennsylvania Continentals, had moved along the river-bank and were on the enemy's other flank. Now outnumbered more than five to one, the defenders withdrew only with difficulty. Sullivan's pursuit was not vigorous, and he therefore threw away his opportunity to annihilate the disorganized enemy force. Casualty reports of this action are unreliable, but Sullivan apparently lost only three men killed, and the enemy had about thirty killed.</p><p>This was the only pitched battle of Sullivan's expedition, which proceeded to carry out a ruthless devastation of forty Iroquois towns. During the next two years the Iroquois struck back with greater ferocity and frequency than ever. Sullivan had brought back no hostages.</p><p>A portion of the battlefield has been preserved in the 330-acre park, where traces of the earthworks may be seen on high ground overlooking the Chemung River. Newtown Battlefield State Park features a Living History Center and is the sight of large-scale Revolutionary War reenactments.

It is a common misconception that the American Revolution ended with the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown in October 1781. Actually, hostilities continued for another eighteen months, and the greatest crisis in <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/george-washington">George Washington</a>'s personal leadership came while his army was in its last cantonment here at New Windsor.</p><p>Steuben laid out the great camp that held six to eight thousand officers and men during the winter of 1782 to 1783. The troops built some seven hundred huts, each of which accommodated two squads, using trees immediately adjacent to the site. A causeway across Beaver Dam Swamp connected separated portions of the camp. Then a large structure of rough-hewn logs was erected as an all-purpose assembly hall. Originally dubbed "the Temple of Virtue," it was inaugurated with boisterous enthusiasm that "disrobed it of its mantle of purity," as Benson Lossing puts it (<i>Field Book</i>, II, p. 118). It became known simply as the Temple, then as the Public Building.</p><p>It was used for religious services, for Masonic meetings, and for other assemblies. Here on 15 March 1783 Washington appeared unexpectedly before a tense group of his officers and delivered a dramatic appeal to their sense of duty and patriotism that killed the so-called Newburgh Conspiracy. This was a movement of disgruntled officers to coerce Congress into meeting their demands for long over-due pay and allowances and for a life pension.</p><p>In mid-June 1783 most of Washington's troops headed home after learning that Congress was granting them furloughs until the peace treaty was signed and they could be permanently discharged. Their eight months in the Hudson Highlands had been particularly onerous because of shortages in rations and clothing; they were ready to go, and the authorities were happy to be rid of them. On 2 September an auction was held in the Temple to sell off the camp buildings. One of the officers' huts has survived, having been moved a few miles to become somebody's war-surplus home and then having been rescued in 1934 and moved back to the cantonment area.</p><p>In a well-qualified sentence that brooks no paraphrasing, the New York State authorities say, "it stands today as the only known existing wooden camp structure built by Revolutionary soldiers." The Temple was demolished soon after its sale, but a representation of the building now stands on the site.</p><p>The New Windsor Cantonment is open to the public from Wednesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. from mid-April through October. Groups are welcome year-round by appointment. There are drills, demonstrations, and museum exhibits (including of Freemasonry of the colonial era); the 120-acre site includes a picnic area.

Most of the 22-acre Battery Park, which includes Castle Clinton National Monument, sits on landfill and has no Revolutionary War associations. In 1693 the British built a fort on the rocky island where Fort Clinton was subsequently constructed (1808–1811). In 1870 the shoreline was moved out to incorporate the present Battery Park with the island. State Street, along the northeastern edge of the park, marks the original waterfront, where a line of cannon faced the harbor in the Dutch and English periods. In August 1775 <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-lamb">John Lamb</a>'s artillery company, which included Alexander Hamilton, began hauling the British guns up Broadway to the Common (today's City Hall Park) for safekeeping. This provoked a broadside from the man-of-war <i>Asia</i>, which spurred the ongoing exodus of New York's residents. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/charles-lee">Charles Lee</a>'s forces completed the capture of the heavy guns when he arrived to fortify the city in February 1776.</p><p>Looking south from Battery Park into New York Harbor, one can see the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/statue-liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>, which was dedicated in 1886 as a gift to the United States from France, the ally whose backing ensured the American victory in the Revolutionary War. Closed after 9/11, the statue was reopened to the public in August 2004. This renowned monument sits on the 12-acre Liberty Island and offers panoramic views from its crown that rank among the finest in the world.</p><h3><a id="BeekmanHouseSite"><b>Beekman House Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>Beekman House Site,</b> 51st Street and First Avenue. A tablet on Public School 135 indicates the site of Mount Pleasant, the home of James Beekman, erected in 1763 and used during the British occupation of New York as headquarters for Generals Howe, Clinton, and Carlton in turn. Tradition holds that Nathan Hale was kept in the Beekman greenhouse overnight before his execution on 22 September 1776. The house was demolished in 1874.</p><h3><a id="BowlingGreen"><b><a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/bowling-green">Bowling Green</a></b> </a></h3><p><b><a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/bowling-green">Bowling Green</a>,</b> an elliptical park at the south end of Broadway near Battery Park, just north of the United States Custom House, which now houses the National Museum of the American Indian. The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/stamp-act">Stamp Act</a> Riot of 1765 began on the Common and culminated at Bowling Green, where the mob pounded on the gates of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/canadian-political-geography/fort-george">Fort George</a> (now the site of the Custom House), which contained the royal governor's residence. The rioters burned the lieutenant governor's effigy and carriage on the green, using the fence for kindling. On 9 July 1776, after a public reading of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/declaration-independence">Declaration of Independence</a> on the Common, the crowd marched to Bowling Green and pulled down the gilded lead statue of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/british-and-irish-history-biographies/george-iii">George III</a> erected six years earlier. The mob also hacked off the crowns on the iron gate around the green. The gate is New York's first designated City Landmark. Most of the statue was reportedly made into bullets, but the horse's tail and bridle have survived and are in the museum of the New-York Historical Society. The site is now occupied by the statue of Mayor Abraham de Peyster (1691–1695).</p><h3><a id="CentralPark"><b><a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/central-park">Central Park</a></b> </a></h3><p><b><a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/central-park">Central Park</a>.</b> The 843 acres of Central Park are what Bruce Bliven has called "a tidied up sample of what the whole island used to be like." Conservationists see it as a significant inspiration of the nation's park movement. In one corner can be found the vestiges of McGown's Pass.</p><p>In 1850 a press campaign launched by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/william-cullen-bryant"><a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/william-cullen">William Cullen</a> Bryant</a> and backed by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/washington-irving">Washington Irving</a> and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/historians-us-biographies/george-bancroft">George Bancroft</a> persuaded the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts-11">city government</a> to acquire the land. It was then located north of the built-up area, which ended at 42nd Street, and was an unsightly wasteland where squatters raised pigs and goats near their shanties. A largely African American settlement, Seneca Village, covered the area from 81st to 89th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. It was demolished in 1857, and the following year an army of unemployed went to work carrying out the design of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/frederick-law-olmsted">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> (who also designed Brooklyn's Prospect Park) and Calvert de Vaux. The work involved the movement of a billion cubic feet of earth, which explains the degree to which the colonial topography was "tidied up." Central Park is enclosed between 59th Street and 110th Street, bordered on the west by Central Park West and on the east by Fifth Avenue.</p><h3><a id="CityHallPark"><b>City Hall Park</b> </a></h3><p><b>City Hall Park,</b> between Park Row and Broadway at City Hall. The park was originally part of the Common, also known as the Fields. In the colonial period, City Hall stood at Wall and Nassau Streets, today the site of Federal Hall National Memorial. The Fields is where the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/stamp-act">Stamp Act</a> protesters gathered in 1765 and where, by some accounts, the first blood of the Revolution was shed on 11 August 1766, when residents clashed with British soldiers who had cut down the first Liberty Pole. The various structures that occupied the Fields are marked today by plaques and architectural footprints. These include the soldiers' barracks, the Liberty Pole, and the provost prison, called the Bridewell, all of which are located to the west of City Hall.</p><p>A statue of Nathan Hale faces the front of City Hall's east wing, but he was executed elsewhere. (See hale execution site.) To the east of City Hall stood the New Gaol, a jail for debtors, which the British used, along with the Bridewell, to confine American <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/international-law/prisoners-war">prisoners of war</a>. There is also a plaque in honor of Isaac Barre, who proclaimed in Parliament that the colonists were the "<a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/sons-liberty">Sons of Liberty</a>."</p><p>New York patriots met in the Fields on 6 July 1774 and decided to send delegates to the first Continental Congress. Alexander McDougall presided, Alexander Hamilton spoke against British coercion, and the occasion became known in history as the Meeting in the Fields.</p><p>Almost exactly two years later the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/declaration-independence">Declaration of Independence</a> was read in the fields to the troops in Washington's presence.</p><h3><a id="ColumbiaUniversityKingsCollege"><b><a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/columbia-university">Columbia University</a> (King's College)</b> </a></h3><p><b>Columbia University (King's College).</b> At the southeast corner of Park Place and West Broadway a tablet indicates the site of King's College during the period 1755 to 1857. The college occupied an area now bounded by Murray, Barclay, Church, and Chapel Streets. Used as a prison during the British occupation (1776–1783), the college reopened in 1784 as Columbia. It moved to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/madison-avenue">Madison Avenue</a> and 49th Street in 1857, and to its current location, at 116th Street and Broadway, in 1897.</p><h3><a id="DyckmanHouseDyckmanHousePark"><b>Dyckman House, Dyckman House Park</b> </a></h3><p><b>Dyckman House, Dyckman House Park,</b> Broadway at 204th Street. The Dyckman House site was once part of a 300-acre Dutch Colonial farm which served as the Patriot bivouac after the Battle of Harlem Heights in 1776 and as a British camp for the rest of the war. One of the fifty Hessian log huts found at another British camp in northern Manhattan has been reconstructed in the garden, where a well and replica of a smokehouse are also to be seen among the boxwood hedges, fruit trees, and grape arbor of the restored farmyard.</p><p>The house itself is of fieldstone, brick, and wood. The southern wing probably dates from 1725, but most of the house was built around 1785 by William Dyckman, grandson of a Westphalian immigrant, and his descendants gave the property to the city in 1915. Members of the family have since helped in caring for the house. The restored garden and eight furnished rooms of the house are open to the public. The Relic Room contains artifacts gathered from the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/fort-washington">Fort Washington</a> battlefield: bullets, cannonballs, explosive shells, guns, bayonets, a uniform, and even a tattered American flag. Although recent construction has resulted in some unexpected closings, under normal circumstances Dyckman House Park is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Phone: (212) 304-9422.</p><h3><a id="FederalHallNationalMemorial"><b>Federal Hall National Memorial</b> </a></h3><p><b>Federal Hall National Memorial,</b> Wall and Nassau Streets. The site of the old City Hall has been occupied since 1842 by a Greek Revival structure that is now Federal Hall National Memorial. Here the Stamp Act Congress convened in 1765, Congress sat during the period 1785 to 1790, and the first United States Congress was called (4 March 1789). Washington was inaugurated on the balcony of the old building, and the Departments of State and War, as well as the Treasury and the Supreme Court, were created within its walls. The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/bill-rights">Bill of Rights</a> was adopted here by Congress. In 1790 Philadelphia had its turn as the seat of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts-28">federal government</a>, and the old City Hall fell into ruin. The memorial now exhibits documents and artifacts interpreting the role of old City Hall in early American history.</p><h3><b>Fields</b></h3><p><b>Fields,</b> Meeting in the. <i>See</i>city hall park.</p><h3><a id="FortAmsterdamSite"><b>Fort Amsterdam Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Amsterdam Site.</b> Now occupied by the United States Custom House, below Bowling Green at the foot of Broadway. After taking <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> from the Dutch in 1664, the British built Fort George on the same spot, and it became the focus of American anger during the Stamp Act riot in 1765. The lieutenant governor, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/cadwallader-colden">Cadwallader Colden</a>, duped New Yorkers by secretly transferring the newly arrived stamps from the British ship to the fort. The rioters threatened to storm the fort, and Colden was prepared to fire on the crowd, but a compromise was reached, and the stamps were moved to City Hall. When <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/charles-lee">Charles Lee</a> fortified the city in 1776 he had the northern wall of the fort torn down and pointed cannons at the interior to prevent the British from using it as a stronghold, as they had in 1765.</p><h3><a id="FortTryonPark"><b>Fort Tryon Park</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Tryon Park.</b> In a 62-acre park of wooded hills on the north end of Manhattan Island overlooking the Hudson, the stone ramparts of Fort Tryon occupy the site of a redoubt where American Patriots put up their most effective resistance before surrendering <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/fort-washington">Fort Washington</a>. The earthworks on the 250-foot hill were manned by Colonel Moses Rawlings and 250 Maryland and Virginia riflemen supported by three small cannon of the Pennsylvania Artillery. An outpost was located on Cock Hill, about a mile north in what is now Inwood Hill Park.</p><p>About three thousand German troops under General Knyphausen crossed Kings Bridge and attacked Rawlings in two columns. Because of the rugged, wooded terrain, the narrow front that did not enable them to deploy into their normal linear formations, and the effective American defenses, the Germans made very slow headway and sustained heavy casualties. Margaret Corbin became America's first battlefield heroine by replacing her mortally wounded husband and helping keep his gun in action until she herself was severely wounded. The traffic circle and roadway next to the park are named for her, and she is honored by a bronze tablet mounted on the exterior of the fort. (She is buried at West Point.)</p><p>On the site of the American earthworks the British built Fort Tryon. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/john-d-rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a> Jr., bought the estate that became Fort Tryon Park and presented it to the city in 1933. A residence on the site of the fort was demolished, and the hilltop now provides a magnificent view of the Hudson, the East River, and Manhattan.</p><h3><a id="FortWashington"><b>Fort Washington</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Washington</b> and related landmarks. The <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/george-washington">George Washington</a> Bridge (between 178th and 179th Streets) crosses the Hudson between Forts Washington and Lee (in New Jersey), almost completely obliterating those two works. But between West 147th Street and the Bronx are many surviving landmarks of the great military disaster suffered by the Americans in November 1776.</p><p>On 16 November 1776 the British and Germans attacked in strong columns from the north, east, and south to wipe out the bypassed pocket of American resistance on the high ground in northern Manhattan. From McGown's Pass in today's Central Park came two thousand men under Lord Hugh Percy. About eight hundred Americans under Lieutenant Colonel Lambert Cadwalader opposed them in the three defensive lines established before the Battle of Harlem Heights. These are marked by tablets on Broadway at 147th, 153rd (wall of Trinity Cemetery), and 159th Streets.</p><p>Another British attack was from the east across the Harlem River against the defenses of Laurel Hill (192nd Street). On the lawn of George Washington High School at 192nd Street and Audubon Avenue, a boulder at the foot of the flagpole bears a large bronze tablet that reads: "In grateful remembrance of the Patriot Volunteers of the Pennsylvania Flying Camp led by Colonel William Baxter … who, with many of his men, fell while defending this height, 16 November 1776, and was buried near this spot." Baxter's position was later the site of the British Fort George, but his troops occupied only field fortifications when he was attacked by the elite Black Watch and overrun after a spirited defense. Highbridge Park, leading down to the Harlem River from Laurel Hill Terrace, between 181st and 188th Streets, displays the steep terrain the British ascended during the attack. The Forty-second Highlanders dropped down the river to make a diversion about where the foot of 152nd Street is now located. The defenders rushed reinforcements to meet this threat from the converging British columns (Lord Percy having resumed his advance), and heavy fighting took place around Trinity Cemetery. Inside the cemetery, in the southeastern corner (east of Broadway), a bronze tablet on a small boulder marks this middle line of defense and points out the remains of an earthen fort.</p><p>Meanwhile, the main attack was taking place to the north against the works later called Fort Tryon.</p><p>From Fort Lee, across the river, Washington watched helplessly as almost 3,000 of his best officers and men were taken prisoner. Washington also lost a large quantity of valuable matériel, including about 150 cannon.</p><p>The British built on the sites of the main American works, Fort Washington becoming Fort Knyphausen, Rawlings's redoubt becoming Fort Tryon, and the Laurel Hill works becoming Fort George. Archaeologists have identified the sites of many other American, British, and German positions on Washington Heights and in the area eastward to the Harlem River. Along the Bronx side are the sites of eight numbered forts.</p><p>The site of Fort Washington, chosen because it is the highest natural point on Manhattan (265 feet), is marked by a flagpole in Bennett Park, on Fort Washington Avenue between 183nd and 185th Streets. The battle is commemorated by a marble monument with a granite tablet and bronze letters, built into the wall of rock to the left of the park's entrance. Granite blocks in the ground at the center of the park indicate where part of the fort's walls once stood, but the 4 acres of ground inside the fort extended well beyond the edges of the park. Between Fort Washington and Bennett Avenues, Colonel Robert Magaw Place honors the commander of the fort, as does the plaque on the Fort Washington Collegiate Church on the corner at 181st Street.</p><h3><a id="FrauncesTavern"><b>Fraunces Tavern</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fraunces Tavern,</b> lower Manhattan, 54 Pearl Street at Broad Street. "A 1970 conjectural restoration of [the] earliest 18th century structure remaining in Manhattan" is how this landmark has been characterized by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings (1964) puts it in the "Other Sites Considered" category, commenting that "it will be considered in more detail in the study of architecture." Authorities agree, however, that Fraunces Tavern is the oldest surviving building in Manhattan and that—"conjectural restoration" or not—it is a particularly fine specimen of <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/architecture/georgian-architecture">Georgian architecture</a>. Historically, it is remembered primarily as the place where Washington said farewell to his senior officers on 4 December 1783 at the end of the American Revolution.</p><p>The basic structure of 1719 now known as Fraunces Tavern was built by Stephen (Etienne) De Lancey, a wealthy merchant, as an elegant town house on land he got as a wedding present from his father-in-law, Stephen Van Cortlandt, in 1700. The latter had acquired the land about 1671 and built a cottage in which he lived after his marriage to Gertrude Van Rensselaer. So the site of Fraunces Tavern has as much historical interest as the structure itself.</p><p>In 1737 the De Lanceys moved to Broadway and converted their former home into an office and warehouse. The magnificent drawing room, now known as the Long Room (741 square feet), was leased to <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing-biographies/henry-holt">Henry Holt</a>, who staged pantomimes and America's first puppet show where New York's colonial elite had so recently been entertained. The building was offered for sale in 1759, but it was not until 1762 that a buyer, "Black Sam" Fraunces, was found.</p><p>Fraunces had been a caterer at nearby Bowling Green since coming to New York seven years earlier from the French <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/caribbean-political-geography/west-indies">West Indies</a>. He bought the property for £2,000, converted it into a tavern, and called it the Queen's Head. All this happened as the last Seven Years' War ended and the movement toward the American Revolution started developing. The Long Room became popular for social and political meetings not only because of the prime location of the tavern but also because it was the most spacious and elegant public hall available.</p><p>When Van Cortlandt built his cottage on this site it fronted on a canal (now Broad Street) and was on the East River shore. Pearl Street derives its name from the abundance of "pearly shells" scattered here in colonial times. The Whitehall Ferry slip to which Washington walked in 1783 was only two long blocks away. The site is in the middle of today's Whitehall Street, about halfway between Pearl Street and the present ferry landings.</p><p>"Black Sam" Fraunces leased his tavern a few years after establishing it, and he devoted himself to running a wax museum in the city. In 1770 he took over personal management of the tavern. Five years later, on the eve of the Revolution, he gave up the wax museum and tried to sell the tavern, obviously planning to direct his entrepreneurial talents elsewhere. But he could not find a buyer, which is why the name Fraunces ended up being immortalized in American history. After the Revolution he was rewarded by Congress and commended for his kindness toward American prisoners in the city's notorious jails and for his covert assistance to the cause. After Washington's famous farewell in the Long Room Fraunces again undertook to sell the tavern. In 1785 he succeeded, getting $250 (£50) less than he had paid twenty-three years earlier. When Washington returned to New York in 1789 as president, Fraunces became his steward. Moving with Washington to Philadelphia in this same capacity, Fraunces died there in 1795 and is buried in St. Peter's Churchyard of Christ Church.</p><p>Although listed in the New York census of 1790 as white (with a slave in his household), Fraunces probably was of mixed race.</p><p>Restoration of Fraunces Tavern has been functional as well as architectural, its public dining room on the first floor carrying on the tradition of "Black Sam." The Sons of the Revolution bought the three-and-a-half-story building in 1904 and completed the initial restoration in 1907. In 1970 the Long Room was stripped to expose its hand-hewn beams and masonry walls, where patches of the original plaster still showed tufts of the red cowhair binding. The restored room is open to the public, ribbon cutting having been performed by a young descendant of Stephen De Lancey. Throughout the large building are paintings, furnishings, relics, and exhibits that preserve the spirit of the Revolution. The first floor is an upscale restaurant; a museum/gift shop is on the second and third floors. The museum's summer hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday. The hours from October through April are 12 to 5 p.m. except on Saturday, when the museum remains open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Phone: (212) 304-9422.</p><h3><a id="GoldenHill"><b>Golden Hill</b> </a></h3><p><b>Golden Hill,</b> "Battle" of. On 19 January 1770 a force of thirty to forty British soldiers used bayonets to quell a riot involving citizens armed with swords and clubs. The disturbance climaxed a series of protests against the Assembly's support of the Quartering Acts of 1765 and 1774. Several rioters were seriously wounded on Golden Hill, and the action has therefore been called "the first significant fighting of the American Revolution." The site is marked by a tablet at William and John Streets, where once a golden field of wheat grew on a hill.</p><h3><a id="GovernorsIsland"><b>Governors Island</b> </a></h3><p><b>Governors Island.</b> So called because in 1698 the assembly set it aside for the benefit of the royal governors, it was fortified in 1776 by Colonel <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/william-prescott">William Prescott</a>'s regiment. These were the famous diggers of Bunker Hill, but their works on Governors Island were not attacked, and the position was abandoned after the American defeat on Long Island. Governors Island, at the mouth of the East River, helped screen the American retreat to Manhattan on the night of 29 August. Castle William was built on Governors Island at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and the old well on the east side is among the few surviving vestiges of the Revolutionary War works.</p><h3><a id="GracieMansion"><b>Gracie Mansion</b> </a></h3><p><b>Gracie Mansion.</b> The mayor's residence. This fine example of Georgian architecture is in <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/carl-schurz">Carl Schurz</a> Park. (See horn's hook.) It was built during the years 1770 to 1774, first owned by Jacob Walton, bought by Archibald Gracie in 1798, and restored. Information about tours of the interior is available from the Gracie Mansion Conservancy, at (212) 570-4751. Excursion boats provide good views of the mansion's exterior.</p><h3><a id="Greenwich"><b>Greenwich</b> </a></h3><p><b>Greenwich</b> (Village). Before the Revolution two rows of wooden houses belonging mostly to prominent families fronted on Greenwich Street, which was close to the Hudson. Today, an iron bollard, where boats once tied up, marks the old shoreline on the sidewalk in front of the Ear Inn, a nineteenth-century pub on Spring Street between Greenwich and Washington streets. The waterfront has been moved out several hundred yards. When General Israel Putnam and his aide, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/aaron-burr">Aaron Burr</a>, rescued 3,500 American troops by marching them from New York City to Harlem Heights after the Kips Bay invasion on 15 September 1776, their route passed through Greenwich and Chelsea, which were then suburbs. Today there are no Revolutionary War landmarks of significance. Greenwich (pronounced "gren-itch") Village, as this section of the city is called, is a redundancy, for "wich" means "village."</p><h3><a id="HaleExecutionSite"><b>Hale Execution Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>Hale Execution Site.</b> The twenty-one-year-old Nathan Hale of Connecticut stepped forward after no other captain in Knowlton's Rangers would volunteer for the mission of spying on the British. He was captured while returning to his own lines on Harlem Heights. Being in civilian clothes and having incriminating papers on his person, he (like John André) was executed as a spy. As was later the case with André, his death was much lamented by friend as well as foe. His final words were "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country."</p><p>While the site of his hanging on 22 September 1776 has been a matter of controversy, the best evidence suggests that he died in the vicinity of Third Avenue and 66th Street, where the Dove Tavern was located and near the British artillery park. A plaque on the Chatham apartments on Third Avenue at East 65th Street calls this the "probable" site and refers the reader to the New-York Historical Society's website, www.nyhistory.org, for further details. The statue of Hale in City Hall Park; a plaque on the Beekman condominium apartments on First Avenue and East 51st Street (where Hale was probably held overnight in the Beekman greenhouse); a plaque inside and one on the outside of the Yale Club (on Vanderbilt Avenue, west of Grand Central Terminal) have all added to the uncertainty about the execution site. Similarly, a tablet on a meatpacking plant at the southeast corner of First Avenue and 46th Street claimed that Hale was hanged nearby. That plaque came down when the building was demolished along with many others to make way for the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/united-nations/united-nations">United Nations</a> complex.</p><h3><a id="HarlemHeights"><b>Harlem Heights</b> </a></h3><p><b>Harlem Heights,</b> Battle of. Although the site of this early American victory, on 16 September 1776, has long since been covered by some of the world's most exclusive urban development, many of the most important landmarks can be found. American forces had retreated from southern Manhattan to Harlem Heights, the high ground along the Hudson north of modern 125th Street.</p><p>Here they started work on three defensive lines, and before dawn on 16 September Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton led a reconnaissance to find out what the British were doing. With his elite force of 120 Connecticut Rangers, Knowlton made contact near a slight rise still discernable on 106th Street between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive. After a half-hour firefight Knowlton withdrew when threatened with envelopment by the Forty-second Regiment of Scottish Highlanders, the famous Black Watch.</p><p>Skirmishing to the rear in good order, the Americans followed approximately the route now marked by Claremont Avenue and dropped into the valley called the Hollow Way, about where the 125th Street subway station is located. Two British light-infantry regiments pursued to a hill near present-day Grant's Tomb.</p><p>Washington left the Morris-Jumel Mansion and reached the advanced American posts near West 135th Street as Knowlton fought his delaying action. An aide reported that the Rangers were doing well and suggested they be reinforced. The commander in chief was considering this when a familiar tune floated from the enemy position—the call sounded by fox hunters at the end of a successful chase!</p><p>Washington decided that the moment had come to undertake an offensive action. The plan was for one small force to advance directly against the British around the area of Grant's Tomb while a larger body made an envelopment to trap the British. It was working beautifully, the British charging forward from the hill, when unidentified officers in the enveloping wing prematurely gave the order to fire. The British quickly started withdrawing, the Americans pursued, and Washington sent in reinforcements.</p><p>Generally along today's 120th Street the heaviest fighting took place in a buckwheat field. A bronze bas-relief at the Columbia School of Engineering, at Broadway near 118th Street, claims to mark the site of the battle. It is about where the artillery on the British right flank was located after these two 3-pounders had been dragged forward 3 miles by hand. The guns and a company of jaegers may have saved the British from annihilation, but a shortage of ammunition forced another withdrawal. After a brief delaying action along 111th Street, the British made a final stand about where the day's events had started, on 106th Street. Not wanting to fight a major battle, Washington ordered a withdrawal at about 2 p.m.</p><p>Success in this skirmish lifted American morale at a time when this was badly needed, and some historians have seen the victory as a turning point in the war. American casualties were about thirty killed and one hundred wounded or captured. Among the dead was the gallant Knowlton, one of Washington's most promising young officers.</p><h3><a id="HollowWay"><b>Hollow Way</b> </a></h3><p><b>Hollow Way.</b> The valley along the bottom of which today's 125th Street runs east from the Hudson to Morningside Avenue was known as the Hollow Way.

A little hill here is crowned with the Fort Clinton Monument—a cannon on a flat boulder to which a plaque is fixed. The marker says the high ground commanded McGown's Pass and was occupied by the British from 15 September 1776 to 21 November 1783.</p><p>The Post Road passed between two steep hills here before descending abruptly to Harlem Plains (into the present lake, Harlem Meer, in this corner of Central Park). McGown's Pass was therefore what modern tacticians call "critical terrain," and it figures prominently in contemporary accounts of the war in Manhattan. To protect the American retreat after the British invasion at Kips Bay, Washington posted riflemen just south of the pass with instructions to fall back and ambush the British if they advanced along the road between the hills. McGown's Pass Tavern, which survived into modern times, was on the site of Jacob Dyckman's Tavern, where the provincial assembly met in 1752 while City Hall was being repaired.</p><h3><a id="MetropolitanMuseumOfArt"><b><a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/metropolitan-museum-art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a></b> </a></h3><p><b><a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/metropolitan-museum-art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>,</b> main entrance on Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street.

During the Battle of Harlem Heights Washington used this house as his headquarters and lived in a suite of three small rooms on the second floor. The British and Hessians then used the building until their evacuation in 1783.</p><p>When Lieutenant Colonel <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/roger-morris">Roger Morris</a> built his mansion in 1765 it was the first in the colonies to have the two-story Greek Revival portico that later was common. Morris reached America in 1746, took part in the Braddock expedition, becoming a friend of Washington's, and fled the country as a Loyalist at the start of the Revolution. His property was confiscated at the end of the war and bought in 1810 by a wine merchant named Stephen Jumel. The latter's widow married Aaron Burr in 1833, when she was about fifty-five and he was seventy-seven, but the two were separated a few months later.</p><p>In 1903 the city bought the house and saved it from demolition; it, St. Paul's Chapel, and Fraunces Tavern are the last important structures of the colonial era in Manhattan. The house and grounds have been restored. The spacious rooms are furnished in the periods of their respective owners: the lower floor in the late nineteenth century, and the upstairs in American Federal and French Empire. The basement has servant quarters and the kitchen. Early American household utensils are displayed on the third floor.</p><p>Owned by the city, the mansion is operated by a not-for-profit organization, Morris-Jumel Mansion Incorporated, and is open to the public Wednesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Website: www.morrisjumel.org; phone: (212) 923-8008.</p><h3><a id="MortierHouseSite"><b>Mortier House Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>Mortier House Site,</b> Sixth Avenue and Spring Street in lower Manhattan.

Flaunting all historical evidence, circumstantial as well as factual, the myth has persisted that Mary Lindley Murray (1726–1782), a middle-aged Quaker and mother of twelve children, gave a party for British generals Howe, Clinton, and Cornwallis that delayed their military operations two hours and kept them from trapping General Putman's 3,500 troops and 67 guns in lower Manhattan.</p><p>Putnam's column started north at about 4 p.m. Following the Greenwich Road close to the Hudson, it then took farm lanes and footpaths along the axis of today's Eighth Avenue. Around the southwest corner of Central Park the Americans struck the Bloomingdale Road, roughly the route of today's Broadway, as far north as West 86th Street.</p><p>Through a gap of less than three-quarters of a mile between the Hudson River and Murray Hill the long American column passed on its 12-mile forced march without seeing an enemy soldier. ( Just below today's West 100th Street, the British belatedly tried to intercept the column, but most of the Americans had already passed the intersection, and only one man was killed). But historians point out that Mary Murray's cakes and old Madeira do not deserve the credit for keeping the British inactive at Inclenberg. First, she could not have known that Putnam was slipping away rather than preparing to defend the city. Second, the British were following their plan of waiting on Murray Hill until all their forces had crossed from Long Island.</p><p>Yet Mrs. Murray's alleged service to the Patriot cause has been immortalized by painters, playwrights (<i>A Small War on Murray Hill</i> was produced in 1956), and patriotic societies (the plaque on 35th Street was put up by the <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/social-organizations/private-organizations/daughters-american-revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a> in 1926).

A landmark in the Battle of Harlem Heights, the high ground here was the southernmost defensive position of the Americans overlooking the Hollow Way and the point from which Knowlton's flanking force started forward at about 11 a.m. Knowlton was mortally wounded a short time later about half a mile to the southwest.</p><h3><a id="PrisonSites"><b>Prison Sites</b> </a></h3><p><b>Prison Sites.</b> In Manhattan the sites of the notorious British prisons can be identified by today's visitor at the following places:</p><p><b><i>Livingston's Sugar House</i></b> is marked by a tablet opposite the entrance to the Federal Reserve Bank, at 28-36 Liberty Street.</p><p><b><i>Middle Dutch Church</i></b> was where the Mutual Life Insurance Building now stands on the northeast corner of Cedar and Nassau Streets, and is marked by a plaque.</p><p><b><i>Rhinelander Sugar House</i></b> was replaced by the Rhinelander Building, which has also been torn down, and the site, behind the Municipal Building near City Hall, is now occupied by Police Plaza. A window from the original sugar house, preserved in the façade of the Rhinelander Building, was salvaged from the demolition and is now displayed in the side of a brick shed on the edge of Police Plaza. Such windows had iron bars, but no panes of glass to keep out the cold. Another window is in Van Cortlandt Park (see under the bronx).</p><p><b><i>Van Cortlandt's Sugar House</i></b> stood at the northwest corner of today's Trinity Churchyard. One or more other sugar houses were used as prisons.</p><p><b><i>Provost Jail</i>,</b> administered by the notorious William Cunningham, was in the present City Hall Park.</p><p>Dissenter churches, the hospital, and King's College (see columbia university) were also used as prisons. After the fire of September 1776 the prison ships were used for soldiers in addition to the naval prisoners originally held in these death traps. (See prison ship martyrs' monument under brooklyn.)</p><h3><a id="RivingtonsPrintingShopSite"><b>Rivington's Printing Shop Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>Rivington's Printing Shop Site,</b> corner of Wall and Pearl Streets. James Rivington's <i>Royal Gazette</i> and its successor, published 1773 to 1783, are generally accepted as being the country's first daily newspapers. (A complete file is in the New-York Historical Society Library.) His plant was destroyed in November 1775 by Patriots who objected to his journalistic integrity in presenting both sides of contemporary controversies. Rivington took refuge in England but returned two years later as the king's printer in New York City. In 1781 he started supplying information to the American intelligence service, which enabled him to stay in business after the British left. Renamed <i>Rivington's New York Gazette and Universal Advertiser</i>, his paper struggled along despite declining circulation until its final issue of 31 December 1783. The printer tried unsuccessfully to carry on as a bookseller and stationer but ultimately failed and died in poverty. An interesting and important figure, James Rivington deserves more historical recognition than he has received.</p><h3><a id="St.PaulsChapel"><b>St. Paul's Chapel</b> </a></h3><p><b>St. Paul's Chapel,</b> lower Broadway between Fulton and Vesey Streets. Built in 1764 to 1766 by Trinity Church, whose property it remains, St. Paul's Chapel survived the great fire of September 1776 that destroyed the old Trinity. In addition to being, therefore, the only remaining church of the colonial era in Manhattan, St. Paul's has great architectural interest and merit.</p><p>Commencements of King's College (now Columbia University) were held here for twenty-five years, John Jay, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/gouverneur-morris">Gouverneur Morris</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/de-witt-clinton">De Witt Clinton</a> being among those receiving their degrees. British occupation forces used the chapel. A special service was conducted on 30 April 1789 for Congress and George Washington after the latter's first inauguration at nearby (old) City Hall. In the peaceful old cemetery are remains of British officers among the New Yorkers. Against a handsome Palladian window on the Broadway side is the tomb of General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/richard-montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a>, originally buried near where he fell in Quebec in 1775 and moved here in 1818.</p><h3><a id="TrinityChurchAndCemetery"><b>Trinity Church and Cemetery</b> </a></h3><p><b>Trinity Church and Cemetery,</b> Broadway at the beginning of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a>.

It marks the spot where the remarkable Marinus Willett (1740–1830) on 6 June 1775 stopped the British from evacuating five cartloads of weapons and ammunition in their withdrawal from New York City. Seizing the bridle of the leading horse, Willett claimed the British had no authority to carry off the arms. He rallied the mob to his side and took possession of the matériel for the Patriot cause.</p><p>After graduating from King's College (later Columbia), Willett became a wealthy merchant and property owner. As New Yorkers took sides on the eve of the Revolution, he was a leading firebrand among the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/sons-liberty">Sons of Liberty</a>, and when the war started he quickly became an effective combat commander. He particularly distinguished himself in the defense of Fort Stanwix and as commander of New York troops during the last two years of the murderous border warfare in the Mohawk Valley. (See fort plain.)</p><p>He was a sheriff of New York City and County for many years after the war, mayor from 1807 to 1808, and president of the Electoral College in 1824. At the age of fifty-nine he took for his third wife the twenty four-year-old Margaret Bancker, by whom he had three sons and a daughter. Willett was buried in Trinity Cemetery in lower Manhattan. One son, William, became a famous author on religious subjects and published <i>A Narrative of the Military Actions of Colonel Marinus Willett</i> (1831).</p><h2><a id="Queens">QUEENS</a></h2><h3><a id="BowneHouse"><b>Bowne House</b> </a></h3><p><b>Bowne House,</b> adjoining Weeping Beech Park at 37-01 Bowne Street, Flushing.

For defying the Dutch ordinance forbidding Quaker meetings, John Bowne was sentenced to a fine (which he did not pay), thrown in jail, deported to Holland, and finally acquitted. A plaque memorializes signers of the Flushing Remonstrance (1657), a little-known document in the history of religious tolerance in America.

In 1805 this Dutch and colonial frame house became the country home of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/rufus-king">Rufus King</a> (1755–1827), and it remained in his family until 1897. King was a lawyer, delegate to the Continental Congress, United States senator, envoy to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-political-geography/great-britain">Great Britain</a> from 1796 to 1803, and unsuccessful presidential candidate (against <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/james-monroe">James Monroe</a>) in 1816. Sections of King Manor were built in 1730, 1755, and 1806. The house was successively an inn, farmhouse, and parsonage before King acquired it. The furnishings are eighteenth and nineteenth century, some originally in the house. After considerable renovation, the King Manor Museum opened to the public in 1992. The museum room contains hats, silver, and needlework samplers, among other items, to offer a historically accurate look at eighteenth-century Jamaica, Queens.

A marker on the grounds of the church indicates the approximate site of Increase Carpenter's Tavern, where General Nathaniel Woodhull was taken prisoner by British dragoons on 28 August 1776, the day after the Battle of Long Island. Woodhull and his 200 troops had been driving some 1,500 head of cattle eastward out of the clutches of the British on the night of 26 August, and came within 2 miles of Clinton and Howe's stealthy march around the American left wing. The historian William H. W. Sabine has suggested that Woodhull's failure to discover and disrupt the British plan was a deliberate act of treason that cost the Americans the battle the following day. Woodhull died from wounds reportedly inflicted by his captors after he had surrendered.</p><h2><a id="Brooklyn">BROOKLYN</a></h2><p>The name coming from a place near Utrecht in Holland—Breukelen, meaning "broken land"—Brooklyn was settled by Dutch farmers in 1636. They established themselves initially around Wallabout Bay, which was infamous during the Revolution as the place where British prison ships were moored. (See prison ship martyrs' monument.)</p><p>The Battle of Long Island in August 1776 was one of the most important, most complex, and most interesting actions of the Revolution. Although the ground is now covered by one of the world's greatest expanses of urban sprawl, the well-read visitor will find a number of interesting landmarks surviving. Scholars have long been indebted to Henry P. Johnston for his detailed history published in 1878, "The Campaign of 1776 Around New York and Brooklyn …" (in <i>Memoirs of the Long Island Historical Society</i>, III). Johnston's study included a painstaking examination of the ground and identification of landmarks. Another map of historical value was made by Thomas W. Field, correlating these landmarks with streets existing in 1868 (published in <i>Memoirs</i>, II).</p><p>As early as 1846, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/walt-whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, as editor of the <i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</i>, urged the nation to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Long Island with the same fanfare as the <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/days-and-holidays/days-months-holidays-and-festivals/fourth-july">Fourth of July</a>. The effort to establish a "Brooklyn battlefield" was revived sporadically in the early twentieth century, and today the anniversary is marked by "Battle Week," a series of lectures, tours, and ceremonies in late August organized by state and local groups in conjunction with the National Park Service. Information is available from Green-Wood Cemetery, the Old Stone House Historic Interpretive Center, the Fraunces Tavern Museum, the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York, and local chapters of the Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution.</p><p>Parks and two cemeteries now preserve—at least to the extent that the ground is not covered by buildings and streets—several of the areas of modern Brooklyn associated with the battle of 27 August 1776.</p><p>After a large-scale buildup of army and navy forces on Staten Island, General William Howe and his brother, Admiral Lord Richard Howe, launched their amphibious assault on Long Island at dawn on 22 August. An American outpost at Denyse's Point (now Fort Hamilton) withdrew toward Prospect Hill (now Prospect Park). After the initial landing of four thousand British and German troops under Generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, their boats returned for an additional five thousand troops; these came ashore in Gravesend Bay between today's Dyker Beach Park and Bensonhurst Park. (The area is now buried under the Shore Parkway of the Belt System and by tall apartment houses.)</p><p>As more troops were ferried across Lower Bay, the British established a beachhead line through the villages of New Utrecht (about where the avenue of that name intersects 85th Street), Gravesend (around the present cemetery of that name), and Flatlands (where the avenue of that name crosses what is still called Kings Highway). On Kings Highway just east of Flatbush Avenue, a bronze plaque on the lawn of the Flatlands Reformed Church (formerly the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/protestant-denominations/dutch-reformed-church">Dutch Reformed Church</a> of Flatlands) marks the path of the British advance on the night of 26 August 1776.</p><p>The Americans had long anticipated the British operation and were deployed along a low, densely wooded ridge called Gowanus Heights, not to be confused with Brooklyn Heights. General Howe's strategy was to make a sweeping envelopment (a "turning movement," to be precise) through Jamaica Pass and then advance eastward through the village of Bedford. While ten thousand troops made this main effort under Howe's personal command, two secondary efforts were made: the first along the shore and the other in the center against Flatbush Pass (now in Prospect Park).</p><p>The British strategy worked beautifully. (Their lines on the left were formed through today's Green-Wood Cemetery and Prospect Park, extending somewhat to the east of the latter area.) The first contact was made around the Red Lion Inn, at the junction of Martense Lane and the Narrows Road (around 39th Street at Third Avenue). Here on the far western flank the Americans built up their main strength, just as Howe had hoped. Heroic and skillful fighting in this area was under the command of General William Alexander ("Lord Stirling"), culminating at the Vechte House.</p><p>In the decisive maneuver, meanwhile, the British had snapped up a five-man American patrol in Jamaica Pass (at Howard's Tavern) and cut behind Washington's main battle position without being detected in time. At 9 a.m. two signal guns were fired by the British in Bedford (about where Nostrand Avenue intersects Fulton Street in today's community of Bedford-Stuyvesant). Some five thousand German auxiliaries under General Leopold Philip von Heister attacked immediately after hearing the signal, pushing through the pass one can see in Prospect Park, fanning right to rout the defenders of Bedford Pass (about where Bedford Avenue intersects Eastern Parkway), moving down the ridge to their left, and pushing north.</p><p>The heaviest fighting took place near Baker's Tavern (about where Flatbush Avenue crosses Fulton Street). Caught between the columns of Howe and von Heister, Americans under General John Sullivan inflicted heavy casualties before being overwhelmed and taken prisoner.</p><p>Many Americans had fled at the first sign that the enemy was to their rear, streaming back into the defenses along Brooklyn Heights (following the route of First Avenue across Gowanus Creek to Court Street) while this way was still open. After General Alexander's efforts to dislodge the British from the Vechte House were abandoned, the remaining American forces could escape only by the hazardous route close to the mouth of Gowanus Creek, where salt marshes bordered an 80-foot-wide gap of water. Washington watched the retreat of his shattered army. A tablet marking the Ponkiesburg (Cobble Hill) fort on a building at Court Street and Atlantic Avenue indicates that his observation point was here. This fort stood behind a line of forts and connecting trenches anchored on the American left by the major work, Fort Putnam (whose site is in today's Fort Greene Park).</p><p>During the land battle the fort on Red Hook exchanged a few shots with a British warship, one of six trying to sail up the East River and threaten the Americans from this quarter.</p><p>General Howe did not follow up his success by assaulting the Brooklyn Heights fortifications, which was a costly error that enabled Washington to save most of his army. After a council of war at the Joralemon House, home of Philip Livingston, Washington executed a secret withdrawal the night of 29 to 30 August. (The site of the Joralemon House is 400 feet south of Joralemon Street on the east side of Hicks Street. A DAR marker on a boulder long and incorrectly identified the house at Montague Street and Pierrepont Place as the site of the council of war. Old Ferry Road is now lower Fulton Street, and the Brooklyn Ferry ran from the foot of Fulton Street westward to Fly Market Slip on Manhattan, now the foot of Maiden Lane.) A tablet on a boulder and plaques in the pavement at the entrance to the Fulton Ferry landing mark this as the spot where Washington embarked his forces during the evacuation from Long Island.</p><h3><b>Fort Defiance</b></h3><p><b>Fort Defiance.</b> <i>See</i>red hook.</p><h3><a id="Green-WoodCemetery"><b>Green-Wood Cemetery</b> </a></h3><p><b>Green-Wood Cemetery.</b> In the Battle of Long Island, 27 August 1776, the British left wing of about seven thousand troops under Brigadier General James Grant (1720–1806) deployed from the center of today's GreenWood Cemetery westward to Gowanus Bay. Also within the confines of the present cemetery were Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut battalions under Colonels Atlee and Haslet and General Parsons. A two-hour action in this sector was restricted to an exchange of artillery and the maneuvering of British light infantry while the envelopment was taking place through Jamaica Pass (see howard's tavern site). Grant then advanced and annihilated the American right wing commanded by General Alexander ("Lord Stirling").</p><p>Although the battle positions within the present cemetery are not marked, the general topography has been preserved. "Battle Hill," where Parsons and Atlee made a stand against Grant's forces, is the site of an annual wreath-laying ceremony. It is marked by an Altar of Liberty and a statue of Minerva, aligned to gaze and wave at the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/statue-liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>, visible in the distance.</p><h3><a id="HowardsTavernSite"><b>Howard's Tavern Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>Howard's Tavern Site,</b> at the northeast corner of Atlantic and Alabama Avenues. Here stood Howard's Half Way House or Tavern. It was in front of the Jamaica Pass, which General Howe found guarded by only a five-man patrol as he moved through with his enveloping force of about ten thousand troops in the early hours of 27 August 1776. (Howard's Tavern was torn down in 1902 to make way for the elevated tracks of the Long Island Railroad). The Jamaica Pass was near the southern end of what is now Evergreen Cemetery. In order to inspect the Jamaica Pass for additional defenders, the British forced Howard and his son to lead them along the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the pass. The son's grave is marked by a tombstone in Evergreen Cemetery; the path is indicated by signs in the grass between the graves, and a map is available from the cemetery office.</p><h3><b>Jamaica Pass</b></h3><p><b>Jamaica Pass.</b> <i>See</i>howard's tavern site.</p><h3><a id="PrisonShipMartyrsMonument"><b>Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument</b> </a></h3><p><b>Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument.</b> In Fort Greene Park, at Myrtle Avenue and Cumberland Street, is the imposing monument designed by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/stanford-white">Stanford White</a> and dedicated in 1908 to the 11,500 American prisoners who died aboard British prison ships in nearby Wallabout Bay (the vestige of which is now Wallabout Channel and Navy Yard Basin). The bones of the estimated 11,500 bodies were collected in the area of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. White's design, featuring a fluted granite shaft 145 feet high, is an important architectural landmark.</p><h3><a id="ProspectPark"><b>Prospect Park</b> </a></h3><p><b>Prospect Park.</b> Preserved within the 526 acres of this landscaped park are the Flatbush Road (now East Drive) and Flatbush Pass (now called Battle Pass) that figured in the Battle of Long Island on 27 August 1776. While the British commander directed his main effort in a cleverly executed strategic envelopment through Jamaica Pass (see howard's tavern site) and further deceived the Americans by a secondary attack on the other flank (see green-wood cemetery), his center column pushed toward Flatbush Pass. Most of the American defenders here fled to the rear when they realized their situation was hopeless, but General Sullivan and some of his men tried to fight their way out. Near Baker's Tavern, close to where Fulton and Flatbush Avenues now intersect, Sullivan and most of his men were trapped and captured. A small monument topped by a bronze eagle marks the site of the ancient Dongan Oak, felled to bar the enemy's advance, and two plaques are mounted on boulders in Battle Pass, which is a little north of the zoo.</p><p>The Maryland Monument is in the south-central part of the park, between the lake and Lookout Hill. A graceful column surmounted by a ball, it commemorates the gallant performance of Smallwood's Maryland Battalion, commanded that day by Major Mordecai Gist. (See vechte house.)</p><p>Prospect Park is on land bought in 1859 from the estate of Edwin C. Litchfield, who had purchased the old Vechte-Cortelyou estate. The development of port facilities on the Gowanus Canal was Litchfield's main activity, and in 1855 he built a showy mansion on the bluff overlooking the harbor. "Litchfield's Castle" has a view of almost a mile to the southeast over the park designed by Frederick Olmsted.</p><p>A Quaker cemetery near Lookout Hill dates from 1662.</p><p>The Lefferts Homestead, on Flatbush Avenue at Empire Boulevard, is a wooden shingle Dutch Colonial farmhouse. Peter Lefferts salvaged wood and hardware from his family home, accidentally burned by the Americans in their "scorched earth" program to deny the British crops, and built this house during the period 1777 to 1783. His family used it as a residence until 1918, when it was presented to the city and moved from 563 Flatbush Avenue to Prospect Park. Authentically refurnished, it is advertised as a children's historical museum and features a spinning and carding room, a Dutch colonial farmyard with farm animals, crafts, storytelling, and a jam-packed educational program.</p><h3><a id="RedHookFortDefiance"><b>Red Hook (Fort Defiance)</b> </a></h3><p><b>Red Hook (Fort Defiance).</b> During the Battle of Long Island, 27 August 1776, six British warships attempted to get up the East River to strike the flank and rear of Washington's forces. They were frustrated primarily by a strong wind, but one ship, the <i>Roebuck</i>, got far enough north to exchange a few shots with Fort Defiance. A bronze plaque (1952) on the red-brick building at Dwight and Beard Streets marks the site of the fort. This is in the Erie Basin area of Red Hook.</p><h3><a id="VechteHouseOldStoneHouseHistoricInterpretiveCenter"><b>Vechte House (Old Stone House Historic Interpretive Center)</b> </a></h3><p><b>Vechte House (Old Stone House Historic Interpretive Center),</b> Third Street between Fifth and Fourth Avenues, in J. J. Byrne Park, is the site of the most heroic action in the Battle of Long Island, 27 August 1776. General William Alexander ("Lord Stirling") used the Vechte House (built 1699) as his headquarters in the initial phases of the battle. When the British accomplished their successful envelopment of the American left (east) flank and moved in strength along the Old Jamaica Road behind the main battle positions of the Americans, the only route of escape was across Gowanus Creek. To save what was left of Washington's army, Alexander ordered Major Mordecai Gist to lead diversionary attacks to the north against the British strong point around the Vechte House. Alexander personally took part in the six determined assaults here, which were finally repulsed only after Cornwallis rushed reinforcements up. Almost all of the 250 Maryland Continentals engaged here were captured or killed.</p><p>Those who died in this engagement are buried at a place marked by a plaque (1947) on Third Avenue between Seventh and Eighth Streets. The Maryland Monument is near Lookout Hill in Prospect Park. The Vechte-Cortelyou House stood until 1897, and its site was later marked by a tablet. A handsome reconstruction now stands there and is operated by an organization called First Battle Revival Alliance. Hours are 12 to 5 p.m., Thursday through Sunday.

At the entrance to the park are tablets indicating that on the adjacent hill (now covered by apartment buildings) the Americans under General Washington erected breastworks for the protection of Kings Bridge (see kings bridge site) and an advanced work, later called Fort Independence, to command Spuyten Duyvil Creek. The positions were abandoned by the Americans in October 1776 when they retreated to White Plains, and the British later incorporated them into their defenses of New York City. In a diversionary effort that turned into a famous fiasco, "Our General" (as he calls himself in his <i>Memoirs</i>) William Heath moved on Fort Independence in January 1777, recaptured the Valentine-Varian House, and tried to cannonade the fort into surrender. After five days he withdrew.</p><p>Children playing on the site discovered cannonballs; this led to excavation of the ruins in 1914 and the recovery of about five hundred balls, shells, and bar shot. One of the children later gave his finds to the museum in the Valentine-Varian House. (See fort number eight.)</p><h3><a id="FortNumberEight"><b>Fort Number Eight</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Number Eight,</b> New York University campus. A boulder here is inscribed "The Site of Fort Number Eight, 1776–1783." Built by the British, the fort was an artillery base during the attack on Fort Washington. It later figured in the skirmishes of the "Neutral Ground," or "Debatable Ground," between American positions in the Hudson Highlands and the British in New York City. After 1779 the fort was headquarters for Colonel Peter De Lancey's Westchester Light Horse Battalion, the "cowboys" who skirmished with the "skinners" of the Neutral Ground between British and Patriot lines in Westchester County from 1778 until the end of the Revolution.</p><p>The site was excavated in 1965, when it was exposed in digging foundations for a new campus building. Numerous artifacts were recovered, much of the material being put in the Valentine-Varian House museum.</p><h3><a id="FortNumberFour"><b>Fort Number Four</b> </a></h3><p><b>Fort Number Four,</b> Old Fort Number Four Park, south end of Jerome Park Reservoir. On a rocky outcropping that faces Reservoir Avenue just west of University Avenue is a plaque erected by the DAR in 1914 stating that the fort was built in 1776 as part of the defenses of Fort Washington and Kings Bridge. Twice attacked, the fort was captured by the British and occupied by British and Hessian troops. Numerous relics, including numbered buttons, were found when the site was explored.</p><h3><a id="KingsBridgeSite"><b>King's Bridge Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>King's Bridge Site,</b> King's Bridge Avenue and West 230th Street. At the place where the Boston Post Road crossed Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the first bridge was built in 1693 under a royal grant to Frederick Philipse and rebuilt in 1713. Broken down by Washington's retreat in October 1776, it was rebuilt by German troops. During the period 1779 to 1782 it was abandoned, being too vulnerable to American raids, and a pontoon bridge was put in farther westward. After the Revolution it was rebuilt with a dike to supply water for Macomb's grist and marble mills. This bend of the creek has subsequently been filled in, and Broadway now passes about 200 yards southeast of the old bridge site, which is marked by a plaque on St. Stephen's Church on West 230th Street.</p><h3><a id="PelhamBayPark"><b>Pelham Bay Park</b> </a></h3><p><b>Pelham Bay Park.</b> After finding his way blocked at Throg's Neck, General Howe reembarked his troops and made another landing a few miles away at Pell's Point. Here, in what has become Pelham Bay Park, was Colonel John Glover's small brigade of Massachusetts troops, including his own Marbleheaders, with three artillery pieces. "Glover's Rock" will be found around the middle of the park, on the old City Island Road, and this marks the place where the Patriots started their well-conducted delaying action on 18 October 1776. Most of the fighting took place near Split Rock, a famous landmark that barely escaped destruction by highway engineers a few years ago; it may be seen on the east side of the New England Thruway near the Hutchinson River Parkway's north entrance to the Thruway (No. 6) at Pelham. For other landmarks associated with the Battle of Pell's Point, see pelham manor.</p><h3><a id="ThrogsNeck"><b>Throg's Neck</b> </a></h3><p><b>Throg's Neck,</b> on the East River. During the period 12 to 18 October 1776 the British under General Howe landed here and made an unsuccessful effort to advance inland. They found the way barred by American defenders at the Westchester Creek Causeway, about where the Bronx and Pelham Bay Parkway crosses the Westchester meadows. Howe made a second amphibious effort at Pell's Point, which is now Pelham Bay Park.</p><h3><a id="Valentine-VarianHouse"><b>Valentine-Varian House</b> </a></h3><p><b>Valentine-Varian House,</b> 3266 Bainbridge Avenue at East 208th Street, adjoining Williamsbridge Park. About 1750 the Valentine family established a farm in the wilderness that has become The Bronx. After living first in a simple cottage, they soon built the large fieldstone structure that has miraculously survived not only the Revolutionary War but also modern urban developers. Peter Valentine may have been the builder and first owner of the house, but it is known that Isaac Valentine bought the property in 1758. His family was forced to flee when Washington's army retreated from Manhattan toward White Plains in the fall of 1776; British and Hessian troops took over the house. When General William Heath undertook his abortive attack on Fort Independence in January 1777, the column under General John Scott overran the outposts on Valentine's Hill and captured the house. The Americans were prepared to use artillery against the house, but this proved to be unnecessary, and later the Valentines moved back in.</p><p>In 1791 the property was bought by Isaac Varian, whose son Isaac became mayor of New York in 1839. The Varians owned 260 acres between the Bronx River and today's Jerome Avenue. After passing through various hands, the house was donated to the Bronx County Historical Society by William C. Beller in 1965 and moved at his expense across the street to its present location. The two-story colonial fieldstone farmhouse with an attic is in a good state of preservation. In one room the wall structure has been exposed to show the original chestnut laths and the mud-and-cow-hair mortar.</p><p>The historic house is owned and managed by the Bronx County Historical Society.

The recently restored manor house and 1,100 acres remain here from an original Dutch grant of the year 1646. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation touts the mansion as the "oldest house in the Bronx." Frederick Van Cortlandt built this fieldstone-and-brick house in 1748. A full basement lighted by ground-level windows, and an attic with gables, make this a large, four-story structure. Architecturally it is a fine example of Georgian Colonial style, and it has been furnished with seventeenth- and eighteenth-century items of Dutch, English, and American origin. Many of these items belonged to the Van Cortlandt family, which occupied the house until 1889.</p><p>During the Revolution the estate was in the Neutral Ground between opposing forces in New York City and the Hudson Highlands. Important public records (the official city archives) were hidden on Vault Hill, the Van Cortlandt burial ground on a hill behind the house. Washington used the house in 1776 when his army was being driven toward the Highlands, and again on the eve of his triumphal reentry into New York City in 1783.</p><p>The house and grounds were deeded to the city in 1889. For eight years the historic mansion was a police station, but since then it has been restored and maintained as a museum by the Colonial Dames. Nine rooms open to the public include a Dutch bedroom with cupboard-style bed reached by a ladder, a basement kitchen with cooking fireplace and Dutch oven, a room for spinning and weaving, and a nursery with an eighteenth-century dollhouse. Furnishings are identified as to period, style, and origin, and Colonial Dames in costume are in attendance. The museum includes weapons and documents. Much of the mansion has been restored, but original features are a double Dutch door, high Dutch stoop, a staircase, the floors, and the basic structure.</p><p>Near the house is a section of brick wall with a window from the Old Sugar House on Duane Street. (See prison sites in section on manhattan.) The family burial ground also is nearby. Inside the northeastern edge of the park at a place called Indian Field is a DAR marker that reads: "August 31, 1778. Upon this field Chief Nimham and 17 Stockbridge Indians from Massachusetts, as allies of the Patriots, gave their lives for Liberty." The Indians had taken position behind a fence to fire on the flank of an advancing column of troops under the leadership of what one authority calls "the ablest and most dashing partisans of the British army—Simcoe, Tarleton, Emmerick, and De Lancey" (Stephen Jenkins, <i>The Story of the Bronx</i>, pp. 162-164). Simcoe spotted the Indians, hit them with a surprise attack on a flank while they were busily engaged in firing on the troops of Emmerick and Tarleton, and killed or seriously wounded about forty. Chief Nimham wounded Simcoe before being killed by the latter's orderly; Tarleton narrowly escaped death while leading the pursuit. Indian dead were buried in the clearing in Van Cortlandt's woods where they fell, and the place has since been known as Indian Field. The Van Cortlandt House Museum is open to the public on Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and on the weekend from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Phone: (718) 543-3344.</p><p>Other sites in New York State associated with this prominent family are the Van Cortlandt Manor and Van Cortlandtville.

Headquarters of Joseph Brant during St. Leger's expedition of 1777 and for many of his subsequent raids on frontier settlements, this Indian fur-trading post on the Susquehanna (the first one that Sir William Johnson established) was an objective of the Sullivan-Clinton Expedition of 1779. Ten years before the Revolution about 750 Indians, mostly Mohawks, lived here. Remnants of the Esopus, driven from the Kingston area, were around Oquaga by 1775. Brant was away on a raid when Continental troops destroyed his base at Oquaga after burning nearby Unadilla, but both of these places continued to be used by the Loyalists and Indians until the end of the Revolution.</p><h3><a id="OriskanyBattlefield"><b>Oriskany Battlefield</b> </a></h3><p><b>Oriskany Battlefield,</b> state park on N.Y. 69, 5 miles east of Rome. A column of eight hundred Patriot militia under General Nicholas Herkimer was marching to the relief of Fort Stanwix when it was ambushed here on 6 August 1777 by four hundred Indians and Loyalists under the Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant.</p><p>When Barry St. Leger's expedition of about two thousand British regulars, Mohawk Valley Loyalists, Canadian auxiliaries, and Indians approached Fort Stanwix (now in Rome, New York), a friendly Oneida reported its advance to General Nicholas Herkimer, commander of militia forces in the Mohawk Valley. Despite considerable reluctance of the settlers to muster for their own defense, Herkimer managed to raise a force of eight hundred men and boys, and on 4 August 1777 he left Fort Dayton (modern Herkimer). Although accompanied by four hundred oxcarts, they were within 10 miles of Fort Stanwix when they made camp at the end of their second day (5 August).</p><p>Herkimer sent runners to request that a sortie from the fort be made to provide a diversion as the relief column arrived.</p><p>The legendary Molly Brant, Indian mistress of Sir William Johnson and sister of the Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant, brought word to Barry St. Leger the evening of 5 August that Herkimer was 10 miles from Fort Stanwix. The British commander sent Joseph Brant with four hundred Indians and a party of Loyalists to ambush the relief column at the place now known as Battle Brook. Here a ravine 200 yards wide would have to be crossed on a causeway by the enemy, and heavy woods provided cover and concealment for Brant's force.</p><p>On the morning of 6 August, Herkimer was adamantly refusing to march on to Fort Stanwix until he heard evidence that the sortie was being made. The regimental commanders were insisting that the expedition press on immediately. Two of them apparently went so far as to impugn Herkimer's courage and loyalty, and the militia general finally gave way to the pressure.</p><p>Herkimer's sixty Oneida scouts failed to detect signs of the ambush, and without the rudimentary security precautions of a column marching in hostile territory, the militia plunged into the trap.</p><p>More than a dozen officers, including Herkimer, went down in the initial hail of fire. The mile-long column probably had contracted a great deal as the leading elements bunched up to get through this defile, but it is not likely that all of the two hundred-man regiment of Richard Visscher (or Fisher) had gotten within the ambush when the firing started. Apparently this rearguard regiment panicked and ran for home, leaving six hundred men in the other three regiments to their fate.</p><p>The latter reacted like veterans. Instead of cowering where they had been hit by the initial volley, they charged toward their hidden attackers and then formed in little groups for defense. The Indians, who were still outnumbered two to one, hesitated to take advantage of their surprise to close in and annihilate Herkimer's force before it could recover sufficiently to organize a defense. After consolidating into a single perimeter, the militia then took advantage of a lull in the battle—a heavy rain that kept both sides from firing for about an hour—to make another important improvement in their position. General Herkimer, bleeding profusely from a leg wound, insisted on being propped up where he could continue to command his men. He had noticed during the first forty-five minutes of the action, before the rain, that individual defenders along the perimeter were being rushed by the Indians and tomahawked as they reloaded. Herkimer issued orders for men to form pairs, and a good many Indians were stopped dead before the others detected this change in tactics.</p><p>Although they continued their sniping for about six hours, the Indians could not pry the militia from their defensive positions. Though the exact number of Indian casualties cannot be determined, Oriskany was nevertheless the heaviest engagement fought by St. Leger's expedition.</p><p>A force of Royal Greens came from St. Leger's camp to reinforce Brant, and after turning their coats inside out they attempted to get into Herkimer's lines by pretending to be reinforcements sent from Fort Stanwix. The ruse was about to succeed when a sharp-eyed Palatine recognized a Loyalist neighbor, and a spirited little hand-to-hand civil war ensued.</p><p>The Indians started drifting off about this time, and the Loyalists had to withdraw also. Herkimer's militia marched back to Fort Dayton carrying fifty wounded. The number of Patriot casualties also remains unknown, though the dead included two of the regimental commanders who had goaded Herkimer into proving his courage and loyalty by pressing on to Fort Stanwix prematurely, without taking normal tactical precautions. Herkimer died of his wound ten days later in his home near modern Little Falls on N.Y. 58 (see herkimer home).</p><p>When Brant and his Indians got back to the siege of Fort Stanwix and discovered that a sortie from the fort had cleaned out their camp, they were more convinced than ever that they had made a bad mistake in joining St. Leger's war party. They were ready to go home, and it was not long before they did so. (See fort stanwix.)</p><p>Oriskany State Park includes the well-preserved site of the battle, where reenactments are staged at various times throughout the year.

Until 1940 it was in continuous use as a church, and summer services were held in it through 1959. The Palatine Society of New York has restored its original appearance by, among other things, moving the door back to the north side from the east end, where it had been relocated in 1870.</p><h3><a id="Peekskill"><b>Peekskill</b> </a></h3><p><b>Peekskill,</b> on the Hudson River in upper Westchester County. Taking its name from the creek named for Jan Peek, a Dutch trader who settled on its bank in 1665, Peekskill was a trade town for farmers for two centuries. Early in the Revolution there was much military activity here because the Hudson River landing and road approaches to the Hudson Highlands (see continental village) made it a transportation hub. Few historic sites of the period exist, but the Memorial Museum of the Field Library, 124 Union Avenue, contains a Patriot cannon that fired on the <i>Vulture</i>, thereby setting in train the events that led to Major John André's death as a spy. (See west point military reservation, tarrytown, van cortlandtville, and tappan historic district.)</p><p>Drum Hill School, on Ringgold Street past the high school, is on the hill occupied by the British on 23 March 1777 when they made one of their many raids into Peekskill. At 942 South Street is the forty-eighth milestone on the Albany Post Road, placed under Franklin's post-Revolutionary War program of setting up markers. (They were always on the west side, as an aid to land navigation.) Trees where Loyalist spies were hanged have a morbid appeal to some, and a tablet on the grounds of the Peekskill Military Academy immortalizes one of these.</p><h3><a id="PelhamManor"><b>Pelham Manor</b> </a></h3><p><b>Pelham Manor,</b> Westchester County. The Battle of Pell's Point started at Glover's Rock, proceeded along the line of today's Hutchinson River Turnpike past historic Split Rock (see pelham bay park under the section on the Bronx, new york city), then along the old Post Road to end at the bridge over the Hutchinson River. Surviving landmarks in modern Pelham Manor are along Wolf 's Lane. The Pell Mansion, or "Pelham Dale," home of Colonel David J. Pell and built sometime before 1776, is standing off Wolf's Lane at 45 Iden Avenue. The "Lord Howe Chestnut," under which the British commander is said to have paused for lunch, survived until the 1940s near Wolf's Lane and not far from the Pell Mansion. (Edgar H. Browne, historian of the town of Pelham, stated that "it stood above the Boy Scout Cabin along the Hutchinson River Parkway, but it died and was taken down a few years before the Scout Cabin was destroyed by fire in 1947.")</p><p>At Wolf's Lane and Colonial Avenue is a marker on a rock indicating that at this point on the old Post Road, the British camped while Colonel John Glover's delaying force slipped away.</p><h3><a id="PhilipsburgManorUpperMills"><b>Philipsburg Manor (Upper Mills)</b> </a></h3><p><b>Philipsburg Manor (Upper Mills),</b> east bank of Hudson on N.Y. 9 at North Tarrytown, 2 miles north of Tappan Zee Bridge. The Lower Mills survive in Yonkers as Philipse Manor. The manor house at Upper Mills was built in 1682. Never the major family residence, the stone building was the center of a trading complex and on several occasions was used as a fort. The original house, mill, and dam have been fully and authentically restored. Like many other manors of the Hudson, it was subject to tenant uprisings in the years surrounding the Revolution. In addition to tenant farmers, Philipsburg relied on slave labor. The excellent tour of the manor draws attention to this little-known history. It is now a National Historic Landmark. The site is open to the public every day except Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and features guided tours and educational programs. Phone: (914) 631-3993.</p><h3><a id="PhilipseManor"><b>Philipse Manor</b> </a></h3><p><b>Philipse Manor,</b> Warburton Avenue at Dock Street, in downtown Yonkers. Since 1966 under the jurisdiction of the New York State Historic Trust, the Manor Hall of Philipsburg may be looked on as a sacrifice to American democracy. The Manor of Philipsburg was established by a man who came to New Netherlands as a carpenter in the early 1650s. As early as 1672 this Frederick Philipse, a Dutch immigrant, had parlayed his skill as a carpenter into real estate, trade, and shipping, and had started acquiring property along the east bank of the Hudson. Ultimately he held all the land from the Croton River south some 22 miles to Spuyten Duyvil Creek (now the Harlem River). In 1693 this estate was confirmed as the Manor of Philipsburg.</p><p>The existing Philipse Manor Hall in Yonkers was started around 1682 (south wing facing Dock Street), and the modern wing was added around 1745. Located on the Albany Post Road, it was one of the great homes of colonial America.</p><p>During the Revolution, the third lord of the manor remained loyal to the constituted authority under which his family had prospered, and his estate was confiscated by New York. The land was fragmented, and the Manor Hall passed through various hands. From 1868 to 1872 it was the Yonkers Village Hall; then it was the City Hall. In 1908 the site was purchased by the state with a cash gift from Eva Smith Cochran, and her son contributed his extensive collection of presidential portraits, now exhibited in the mansion. The priceless collection includes five portraits of Washington, three of which depict him with brown eyes and two with blue eyes.</p><p>The L-shaped house of weathered brick with white wood trim, hipped slate roof, dormers, and a roof balustrade is furnished in the colonial period. It is open year-round, Wednesday and Thursday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Admission is free. Phone: (914) 965-4027.</p><p>Other vestiges of this early American and most un-American barony are preserved at Philipsburg Manor, North Tarrytown.</p><h3><a id="RamapoValleyTheClove"><b>Ramapo Valley ("the Clove")</b> </a></h3><p><b>Ramapo Valley ("the Clove"),</b> roughly between Thruway Exits 15 (Suffern) and 16 (Harriman). An historical area marker at the Sloatsburg service area on the thruway summarizes the story of this unusual region. From the latter place, now in the vicinity of Monroe (where the Museum Village of Smith's Clove is located on N.Y. 17 Exit 129, 4 miles west of Thruway Exit 16; phone: (845) 782-8247), other passes of the Hudson Highlands lead toward Stony Point, the area that is now Bear Mountain Park, West Point, and the Newburgh area. The Ramapo Valley was the best route between the New Windsor Cantonment and New Jersey.</p><p>The Ramapo Furnaces, or Sterling Iron Works, dating from 1751, produced the gigantic chain that obstructed the Hudson River.</p><p>Even in very modern times this has been an isolated region where descendants of Loyalist, Hessian, Dutch, African American, and Indian refugees lived in seclusion, becoming known collectively as Jackson Whites. During the Revolution the area was the haunt of the notorious Loyalist highwayman Claudius Smith, who specialized in stealing livestock for sale to the British. On a trail about a mile from the railroad station in Tuxedo are two large caves where Smith's men and stolen animals were hidden. In 1779 a concerted effort was taken to exterminate the Smith gang. Their leader was captured on Long Island, returned in chains, and executed.</p><p>In Suffern the tavern and store of the village founder, John Suffern (1741–1836), was located at the important crossroads just south of Ramapo Pass. (The tavern site is at Washington and Lafayette Avenues.) During a five-day stay here in July 1777 Washington wrote the letter to Congress that resulted in Robert Erskine's becoming the famous mapmaker of the Continental army. In August 1780 Washington made his headquarters for sixteen days in the home of Andrew Hopper, a mile below Suffern. Here he learned of the disaster at Camden, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/south-carolina">South Carolina</a>. He was in this area again when French and American troops marched south from Kings Ferry on their way to Yorktown.</p><h3><a id="RaynhamHall"><b>Raynham Hall</b> </a></h3><p><b>Raynham Hall,</b> Long Island, on 20 West Main Street in Oyster Bay, 7 miles north of Northern State Parkway Exit 35. Addition of the Victorian wing about 1851 and concurrent alterations in that unfortunate style have not destroyed the attraction of this Revolutionary War landmark. The oldest portion dates from the 1730s, before Samuel Townsend bought the farmhouse in 1738 and enlarged it into an eight-room, clapboard, one-and-a-half-story house. Raynham Hall is presently a twenty-room house museum. In 2002 it was named a Revolutionary War Heritage Trail Site by the New York governor, putting it in line for money designated to help preserve New York's Revolutionary War heritage.</p><p>During the British occupation of Long Island, from 1776 to the end of the war, Raynham Hall was used as officers' quarters. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/canadian-history-biographies/john-graves-simcoe">John Graves Simcoe</a> lived here during the winter of 1778 to 1779 when his famous Loyalist regiment, the Queen's Rangers, was operating in New York and New Jersey. Among the visitors to the house was Major John André, a principal staff officer of the British commander in chief with whom the traitor Benedict Arnold was dealing from May 1779 until André's capture as a spy in September 1780. The fanciful legend has been perpetuated that Sally Townsend overheard a conversation between Simcoe and André, relayed this to her brother Robert, and thus disclosed the plot to surrender West Point. Plausibility is introduced by the fact that Sally's brother was Washington's most valuable secret agent in New York from about the time Arnold started negotiating his betrayal. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/robert-townsend">Robert Townsend</a> succeeded a former agent in Manhattan called Culper Senior and himself had the code name Culper Junior. But the facts are that Arnold's treason was not disclosed until André was accidentally captured at Tarrytown, and Washington's secret service did not have the slightest suspicion that Arnold had been dealing with the enemy for sixteen months.</p><p>Raynham Hall has historical and architectural attraction. The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings (1964) puts it in the "Sites Also Noted" category. In addition to the aura of romance associated with the names of "the adorable Sally Townsend," the dashing young André and Simcoe, and the Patriot secret service, the house has authentic furnishings, old documents, and a colonial garden. Two links from the great Hudson River chain are in the garden. (The owner of the Sterling Iron Works in the Ramapo Valley was a relative of the Townsends of Raynham Hall.)

Now called the Richmondtown Restoration, or Historic Richmond Town, it is a historic village and museum complex on 100 acres of land with twenty-seven original buildings spanning three centuries of Staten Island's history. There are several houses that date from the colonial period, including the Treasure House (c. 1700), where British officers are said to have hidden in the walls the gold coins that were discovered just before the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a>. The Christopher House (c. 1720) is said to have been a clandestine meeting place for local Patriots, including members of the Mersereau family, who spied for George Washington during the Revolution. Also of interest are the Voorlezer's House (c. 1695), the Moravian Cemetery, the Church of St. Andrew, and the Museum of the Staten Island Historical Society, which displays objects collected from the British fort on nearby Richmond Hill.

The house of Colonel Beverley Robinson (1721–1792) was located at this place until its destruction by fire in 1892. A wealthy Loyalist, he served with distinction as a regimental commander of Loyalist troops (particularly in the capture of Fort Montgomery), but was of most use to the British as an intelligence agent. His fine home was used by the Patriots as a military headquarters and as a hospital. Benedict Arnold and his wife were living here when Arnold's treason was uncovered (see west point).</p><p>The site is a plot of lawn just north of a more recent house and alongside N.Y. 9D, about 5.5 miles north of Bear Mountain Bridge. A highway marker has recently been put up. The original well survives. It had stairs leading to an underground storage room. Now protected by a flat frame covering, it is visible near the base of a large tree between the Robinson House site and a frame barn east of the modern highway. (The road ran to the east of the barn in colonial days.)</p><p>Southeast of the Robinson House is Sugarloaf, on the northern slopes of which the Patriots built a fort in 1776 to 1777 as part of the defenses of the Hudson Highlands.</p><p>A highway marker about 0.1 mile north of the Robinson House indicates the trail down which Arnold fled to Beverley Dock and thence by barge down the Hudson to the British ship <i>Vulture</i>. The trail now winds down a steep hill past modern housing and the village dump to a shoreline reshaped by construction of the railroad. Lossing used the dock and followed this traditional trail of Arnold's flight in visiting and sketching the Robinson House in 1848, when it was in an excellent state of preservation (<i>Pictorial Field Book</i>, II, p. 140).</p><p>Mandeville's House (1737) is standing just northwest of the road junction, about 0.9 mile north of the Robinson House. Privately owned and in excellent condition, it may be seen from the road that leads down to Garrison. Officers of the West Point garrison used this house as headquarters from 1778 until the end of the Revolution.</p><h3><a id="SagHarbor"><b>Sag Harbor</b> </a></h3><p><b>Sag Harbor,</b> Long Island. The scene of a famous raid across the Long Island Sound in May 1777, when Colonel Return Jonathan Meigs with 170 men in 13 whaleboats escorted by two armed sloops surprised and badly defeated a large British foraging party (under connecticut see meigs house site and guilford). Now a place of about 2,500 people (although the summer population may be as much as three times that number), Sag Harbor has twelve old structures of architectural importance, the Custom House, Jared Wade House, and Prime House being from the eighteenth century. The Suffolk County Whaling Museum (early 1800s), Main and Garden Streets, has colonial pieces in addition to relics of the nineteenth-century whaling industry for which Sag Harbor was an important center. The Meigs Monument, Union Street, is on the site of the British fort captured by the Patriots.</p><h3><a id="SagtikosManor"><b>Sagtikos Manor</b> </a></h3><p><b>Sagtikos Manor,</b> West Bay Shore, Long Island. Originally a Van Cortlandt grant (1697), the 1,200 acres were bought by Jonathan Thompson in 1758. The latter's son Isaac acquired the manor as a gift when he married Mary Gardiner, and the house has remained in the same family since that time. (There were two subsequent intermarriages between Thompsons and Gardiners.) The oldest portion of the well-preserved house dates probably from 1692, and today's visitor can see the bedrooms where General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/sir-henry-clinton">Sir Henry Clinton</a> and President George Washington spent the night, the former an unwanted guest during the Revolution (others were Hugh Percy, William Erskine, and William Schaw Cathcart) and the latter in 1790. Wings were added to the house in the late 1890s. The manor's last private owner, Robert David Lion Gardiner, established a foundation for the home and site's preservation. Suffolk County purchased the home from the foundation in November 2002, and it is presently under renovation to make it a public museum. The manor is located approximately one-half mile east of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/robert-moses">Robert Moses</a> Causeway on Montauk Highway in West Bay Shore.

Several road signs will indicate specific directions. Modern Schuylersville is the Saratoga of the Revolutionary era, and this is where Burgoyne's army finally laid down its arms. The modern village of Bemis Heights, then known as Bemis Tavern, takes its name from the high ground where the Americans had their field fortifications—their base camp—for the battles of Saratoga. The battles are generally known by the names of Freeman's Farm and Bemis Heights. Sometimes, however, they are given the name of Stillwater, which was (and is) the village 3 miles farther south, where the American forces concentrated before taking up position on Bemis Heights. All these obscure names have become lumped as "Saratoga," a name known today as one of the decisive battles of history.</p><h2><a id="FirstSaratoga">FIRST SARATOGA</a></h2><p>"Gentleman Johnny" Burgoyne, so called by his soldiers because he treated them like human beings and not like hunting dogs, had been moving down from Canada with a force of about eight thousand fighting men. (Another one thousand or so noncombatants and authorized camp followers came along, the latter including Indian women as well as other ladies such as the baroness de Riedesel and her three very young daughters.) Lieutenant Colonel Barry St. Leger led an expedition from Canada that was supposed to move down the Mohawk Valley and join Burgoyne at Albany. Nobody knows for sure even today what sort of British military effort was supposed to be made up the Hudson from New York City in connection with Burgoyne's invasion. The point did not become obviously important until Burgoyne got in trouble at Saratoga.</p><p>Burgoyne captured Fort Ticonderoga and pushed on to the southern tip of Lake George and modern Whitehall with such ease that he let optimism blind him to dangers. But it was apparent to experienced military subordinates in Burgoyne's expedition that their supply lines were at the breaking point. Just a week later (23 August 1777) St. Leger had to acknowledge that his expedition had failed, and he withdrew toward Canada after being stopped by the defenders of Fort Stanwix.</p><p>Although General Schuyler's Northern army had been forced to retreat before Burgoyne's advance, it was now succeeding in reducing the enemy to a snail's pace. Putting one thousand woodsmen to work felling trees and placing other obstacles in Burgoyne's path from Whitehall to Fort Edward (on the Hudson River), Schuyler forced the British to take twenty days to cover the 22 miles. Burgoyne now had a line of communications stretching 185 miles from Fort Edward to Montreal, with almost 40 miles of portages at both ends of Lake Champlain and near Ticonderoga. But he pressed on toward Albany. Schuyler had sent the Polish military engineer <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/thaddeus-kosciuszko">Thaddeus Kosciuszko</a> to select a position for stopping this advance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Washington had started sending Schuyler reinforcements. Benedict Arnold, disgusted by the protracted charges that he had misused funds during his Canadian operations, had finally submitted his resignation to Congress, but on that same day (11 July 1777) Congress got a request from Washington that Arnold be assigned to Schuyler's command.</p><p>Major General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/benjamin-lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a> was sent on Washington's recommendation to command the New England militia being assembled in Vermont to support Schuyler. Both officers proved to be of immediate value, Lincoln at Bennington (see bennington battlefield) and Arnold in leading the relief column to Fort Stanwix. Arnold is also credited with assisting Kosciuszko in laying out the positions at Bemis Heights, and he was a hero of the subsequent Battles of Saratoga.</p><p>These two leaders arrived without troops, but Washington also sent Dan Morgan with his five hundred Virginia riflemen and the Massachusetts brigades of John Glover and John Nixon.</p><p>Schuyler had the situation under control by this time, but political pressure nevertheless resulted in his being relieved of command and superseded by Major General Horatio Gates. Son of a duke's housekeeper, this unattractive little Englishman was a social radical and sound military professional. He and Arnold were immediately at odds, a personality clash that could easily have given the story of Saratoga a less happy ending. The factionalism between the Gates and the Schuyler parties in the Northern army, New Englanders against New Yorkers, not only weakened the military effort but also led to the so-called <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/conway-cabal">Conway Cabal</a>, the objective of which was to have Gates replace Washington as commander in chief. The decisive Battles of Saratoga therefore involved more than a visitor will see from a tour of the site today, and this should make an account of the battles all the more interesting.</p><p>On 13 September 1777 Burgoyne started crossing the Hudson from the east bank to Saratoga (now Schuylerville), and four days later he halted his cautious advance and deployed about 3 miles short of Bemis Heights. Abandoned by all but about fifty of his Indians, he was groping in the dark for lack of military intelligence. Rebel patrols had been harassing his now-reduced force of about six thousand rank and file, and Gates was well informed about his movements.</p><p>The Battle of Freeman's Farm, or the First Battle of Saratoga, on 19 September, was brought on by Burgoyne's reconnaissance in force by three columns to "develop the situation." Gates was content to sit in his prepared positions, letting Burgoyne take the initiative, but Arnold prevailed on him to use part of his numerical superiority to conduct an "active defense." Dan Morgan and Henry Dearborn therefore moved forward through the rough, wooded terrain on the west side of the battlefield. At 12:30 the advance guard of the British center column had reached Freeman's Farm, where Burgoyne ordered it to halt until the progress of the column on the right was known. Dan Morgan's "turkey shooters" worked their way into position around the unsuspecting enemy regulars, and at 12:45 delivered a surprise fire that knocked out all their officers and drove the others back in blind panic. The Virginians followed up with an enthusiastic but disorganized charge that brought them into collision with the main body of this center column, whose well-disciplined fire sent the Rebels scampering for cover. The American light infantry rallied, however, and they were reinforced by seven regiments. For three or four hours a heavy engagement was sustained, the Americans charging when the opportunity seemed to be promising and always being driven back to their line of departure by equally determined British regulars.</p><p>General Riedesel accepted the risk of leaving a reduced force to guard the position he had taken up near the river to protect Burgoyne's supplies, and sent reinforcements to the center column. After detaching four guns for this purpose as soon as he learned that a general engagement was shaping up around Freeman's Farm, Riedesel also reconnoitered a route to be used if he had to send more support. At about 5 p.m. Riedesel got orders from Burgoyne to head for Freeman's Farm and launch an attack on the American east flank to take pressure off the seriously threatened positions of the center column. When Riedesel threw his German regulars piecemeal against the American flank, Burgoyne attacked around Freeman's Farm and slowly gained ground.</p><p>Not only did Gates fail to take advantage of his opportunity to annihilate the reduced forces guarding Burgoyne's vital bateaux and supply train along the river bank, but also, when Arnold returned to Bemis Heights for more reinforcements, he did not let him return to the battlefield. The battle ended with Burgoyne's troops holding the field, but their losses had been exorbitant: 350 dead or wounded out of the 800 who bore the brunt of the fighting. The right-flank column spent most of the day beating its way through the wilderness and was never actively engaged. The Americans lost about 320 killed, wounded, and missing.</p><h2><a id="SecondSaratoga">SECOND SARATOGA</a></h2><p>Burgoyne wanted to resume his offensive the next day, 20 September, but General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/canadian-history-biographies/simon-fraser">Simon Fraser</a>, who had led the hard but futile effort of the flank column, convinced him that his grenadiers and light infantry would do much better after a day's rest. Having agreed to this delay, "Gentleman Johnny" then postponed his attack again because he received a message from Sir Henry Clinton offering to make a diversion up the Hudson from New York City to support him. Burgoyne therefore put his troops to work building an extensive system of field fortifications. At Freeman's Farm the Balcarres Redoubt was built, and it was the most important of the forward positions. About 200 yards to the north was the Breymann Redoubt. Between these two key works the Canadian auxiliaries went to work forming a screen of stockaded cabins. An entrenched camp was constructed on the plateau overlooking the North Branch of Mill Creek, between the Balcarres Redoubt and the Hudson. On higher ground to the rear the Great Redoubt and two smaller earthworks were built to cover the Great Ravine and the floating bridge constructed across the Hudson.</p><p>American militia under the command of Lincoln were now conducting serious raids against British positions along their vital line of communications to Lake Champlain. Militia reinforcements were swelling the ranks of Gates's force at Bemis Heights, and thanks to General Schuyler's efforts, supplies and ammunition were also coming in. Burgoyne's ranks, on the other hand, were being reduced by desertion and disease. His horses were starving. The troops had been living on salt pork and flour for some time, and on 3 October their rations had to be reduced by one-third. Enemy patrols swarmed around Burgoyne's camp, cutting off foraging parties and keeping his men constantly on the alert against threatened attack.</p><p>Rejecting Riedesel's proposal that he withdraw, reestablish communications with Canada, and wait for Clinton's diversion to materialize, Burgoyne insisted on making one more effort to fight his way to Albany. The Second Battle of Saratoga, on 7 October, resulted from another reconnaissance in force, because Burgoyne still had been unable to get information with which to plan a coordinated attack on Bemis Heights.</p><p>Using his 600 auxiliaries and Captain Fraser's company of rangers to screen his right flank, Burgoyne sent 1,500 regulars in a southwesterly direction toward high ground that had been his objective in the first battle. About half a mile west of the Neilson House this terrain had been unfortified three weeks earlier, but Gates had taken advantage of the additional time and reinforcements to construct earthworks there.</p><p>The British tactics were mysterious. They advanced slowly for less than a mile and then formed on a front of about 1,000 yards on a gentle rise north of Mill Creek. A wheat field to the front permitted good observation and fields of fire from the British line, but the flanks were in the woods.</p><p>Benedict Arnold had been relieved of command after a dispute with Gates, but the latter was acting as if he had learned something of Arnold's tactical style, and he ordered Morgan to "begin the game" by the same sort of flank attack the Virginians had made before. Gates ordered the eight-hundred-man brigade of General Enoch Poor to move through the woods and hit the opposite flank.</p><p>At about 2:30 p.m. this brigade had deployed at the base of a hill held by Major John Acland's grenadiers, who constituted the left (east) flank of Burgoyne's position. Poor's brigade held its formation in the face of all the artillery and small-arms fire Acland could bring to bear. Outnumbered two to one and worried about this well-disciplined operation to their front, the grenadiers responded eagerly to their commander's shouted order, "Fix bayonets and charge the damned Rebels." The veteran New Hampshire Continentals fired on the order of their officers, stopped the grenadiers in their tracks, and then surged forward to overrun their position.</p><p>Morgan's Virginians had meanwhile gone into action, routing the flank security of Captain Fraser and hitting the British line on the flank and rear. Dearborn's light infantry arrived just as the British were changing front to meet this threat, and the right of Burgoyne's line was driven back. Sir Francis Clerke was mortally wounded and captured before he could deliver the order for a general withdrawal, and Riedesel's Germans in the center of the line fought on.</p><p>Arnold galloped onto the field at this point, hotly pursued by an officer sent by Gates to order him back to camp.</p><p>It is quite true that Burgoyne's line had become untenable before Arnold arrived, and a general withdrawal had already been ordered. The Germans withstood the frontal attack that Arnold led personally in his first heroic act of the afternoon (it was actually about noon, the battle having lasted only an hour so far), and they withdrew only when their flanks were threatened and when ordered to do so. But Burgoyne merely pulled back into those fortifications he had been building. Arnold's achievement was to drive the British from their redoubts, which took an inspired effort on his part and some very heavy fighting. The point overlooked by Arnold's critics is that the Americans could not afford to let the British continue to hold those positions when there was the very real threat that Clinton's expedition could be advancing up the Hudson to hit the Bemis Heights fortifications from the rear. Even the rumor of such a threat would have been dangerous to Gates, whose force of eleven thousand troops included more than eight thousand militia.</p><p>Having directed the fighting that drove in the British center, Arnold noticed that there was a hero on the other side who was very conspicuous in his efforts to rally troops to delay the American advance.</p><p>"That man on the gray horse is a host in himself and must be disposed of," said Arnold to Dan Morgan. The man was General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/canadian-history-biographies/simon-fraser">Simon Fraser</a>, and he was mortally wounded by one of Morgan's riflemen. Legend has it that Tim Murphy picked off Clerke and Fraser that day, firing at a range of about 300 feet from a perch in a tree.</p><p>Arnold launched a determined attack on the Balcarres Redoubt that was repulsed. Finding a fresh brigade on the field, he then led an assault that cleared out the line of fortified cabins in the low ground between the Balcarres and Breymann Redoubt. Having thus weakened the latter position, Arnold organized and led the attack that overran the Breymann Redoubt, receiving a serious wound in the same leg that had been hit in the assault on Quebec. (There is a monument to this patriotic leg on the battlefield.)</p><p>Burgoyne withdrew in good order to his prepared positions around the Great Redoubt, and two days later he had withdrawn to Schuylerville. Gates was unable to pursue immediately, but by 12 October he had the British surrounded and Burgoyne finally accepted defeat. Negotiations were completed the evening of 16 October, and the formal surrender took place the next day. Playing on the threat of Clinton's appearance to the rear of Gates's army, Burgoyne was able to surrender by convention rather than by capitulation, the significance being that his army would be paroled "upon condition of not serving again in North America during the present contest." Burgoyne and two officers of his staff were eventually allowed to return to England, but his troops ended up as <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/international-law/prisoners-war">prisoners of war</a> because Congress found various pretexts for not ratifying the convention.</p><p>A large national park preserves the rolling countryside, terrain features, and principal landmarks of the Saratoga battlefield. A visitor should try to time a visit for the season of the year when the two battles were fought, not only because the impressions will be more valid historically but also because the fall colors will make the experience particularly memorable. The site superintendent quite rightly points out that three hours should be allowed to do this place justice, and you will need at least an hour to see even briefly the nine major landmarks on the 9-mile automobile route.</p><p>Eight miles north on U.S. 4 and to the right as one enters Schuylerville is a 25-acre detached section of Saratoga National Historical Park where the restored country mansion of General Schuyler is located. Built in 1777 after Burgoyne's troops burned it and other buildings on Schuyler's estate for tactical reasons, it is a large white frame structure of two stories and beautifully simple lines.</p><p>The Field of Grounded Arms, where Burgoyne's surviving 6,300 troops laid down their weapons in surrender on 17 October 1777, is among the "Other Sites Considered" by the National Survey of Historic Sites (1964). On the west bank of the Hudson in Schuylerville on N.Y. 29, a few hundred feet east of U.S. 4, some 50 acres of this historic site have survived as open ground. A neglected landmark is Stark's Knob, just north of Schuylerville.</p><p>The Saratoga Park Battlefield Visitor Center is open year-round, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weather permitting, except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/bible/bible-general/new-year">New Year</a>'s Day.

The tourist is in for a thrill of discovery when he or she turns from the garish sprawl of modern Schenectady into the narrow, tree-lined streets of this recently created historic district. Several hundred houses in this tidy area of several city blocks constitute not only a unique collection of early and intermediate American styles but also a charming neighborhood. All the houses are private, but descriptive literature is available (see below) and guided tours can be arranged.</p><p>The historic district, established legally in 1962, is generally within the area enclosed by a stockade built around the settlement soon after its establishment in 1661. In 1690 this westernmost village in the Mohawk Valley was destroyed by 210 French and Indian raiders. All but five or six houses were burned, and it was with great difficulty that the Mohawks prevailed on the Dutch to reestablish the settlement.</p><p>During and after the Revolution, Schenectady was an important shipping center and base for operations to the west. Its shipyards had a virtual monopoly on construction of Durham boats, river craft of 15 to 20 tons developed originally to carry bulk freight on the lower Delaware. Raiders came close on one or two occasions, but Schenectady was not attacked.</p><p>St. George's Episcopal Church, on North Ferry Street between Union and Front Streets, was built with the help of Trinity Church in New York City and the benefactions of Sir William Johnson during the years 1759 to 1763 by Samuel Fuller, who was responsible for Johnson Hall in Johnstown and other notable structures. According to some authorities, it is the oldest church in the Mohawk Valley. During the Revolution it was closed (probably because of its Loyalist associations), was used as a barracks, and finally became a haven for stray animals. The legend arose that it was the secret burial place of Walter Butler, killed far away on West Canada Creek. In 1793 the building was renovated, a wooden steeple added, and regular services resumed in 1798. Further alterations and renovations took place through the years, the most recent in 1953 when the colonial atmosphere of the interior was restored. Today St. George's is an attractive structure of gray limestone with a gray slate hipped roof and a tall wooden steeple. It sits within an ancient cemetery and now serves the largest parish in the diocese of Albany.</p><p>The many private houses of historic and architectural significance—some dating to about 1700—are described and pictured in an extensive website, www.historicstockade.com. In addition, publications are available from the Schenectady County Historical Society. The society also features many exhibits and archives, and is located at 32 Washington Avenue, Schenectady, N.Y. 12305, in the Stockade District. Phone: (518) 374-0263.</p><h3><a id="SchoharieValley"><b>Schoharie Valley</b> </a></h3><p><b>Schoharie Valley.</b> Still a region of great scenic and historic interest, this long, flat, fertile valley a mere half-hour's drive west of the Hudson was a major source of provisions (mainly grain) for the Patriot cause. For this reason it was an objective of Loyalist and Indian raiders from Canada, and a major landmark survives as the Old Stone Fort in the village of Schoharie. Other sites are associated with the legendary Timothy Murphy.</p><p>Palatines from Livingston Manor bought land in the Schoharie Valley from Indians and, starting in 1713, established seven villages from Central Bridge to Middleburgh. Many markers indicate historic sites associated with this pioneering effort. The Germans prospered as farmers, maintaining good relations with the local Indians who had inhabited the valley since prehistoric times, but as the Revolution approached they split into Rebel and Loyalist factions. A committee of safety was formed in 1775, five minuteman companies were organized, and three forts were eventually built to protect the valley.</p><p>In October 1780 Sir John Johnson and Joseph Brant joined forces at Unadilla and ravaged the valley. Approaching from the southwest and bypassing Upper Fort (the site is in the vicinity of Toepath Mountain), the eight hundred Loyalist and Indian raiders entered the valley at night. The two-hundred-man garrison of Middle Fort (the site is in modern Middleburgh) was alerted by the smoke of burning farms, and the commander was ready to consider surrender terms when Timothy Murphy took matters into his own hands. Already famous for his marksmanship and self-reliance as a scout, Murphy simply drew a bead on the enemy's "flag" each time his craven commander, Major Melancthon Woolsey, tried to receive Sir John's surrender terms. A few stout-hearted fellow soldiers rallied around this insubordinate scout to prevent the officers of the garrison from arresting Murphy, and the raiders, unaware of what was going on inside Middle Fort, moved on for easier pickings.</p><p>Murphy had married a local girl when he had been stationed in the valley two years earlier. The site of the house where he lived for several years and where he died is indicated by a highway marker on N.Y. 30 at Watsonville about 4 miles southwest of Middleburgh. It is in pretty, open farm country where deer are still a traffic hazard.</p><p>Old Stone Fort is located on the outskirts of the village of Schoharie along Fort Road. Ample signage helps greatly in directing visitors. The Old Stone Fort had been built originally in 1772 as a church, and raiders made an unconvincing effort to capture it in 1780. Parishioners from as far as 15 miles away hauled its native limestone blocks in oxcarts to the construction site, and their names are carved in many of the face stones. Names of Loyalist Christians were obliterated later by Patriots. In 1778 the church was enclosed by a stockade; blockhouses at two corners mounted small cannon. The square tower of the church, once topped by a graceful belfry and spire, was manned by sharpshooters when the fort was defended. A sign on the rear wall of the church points up to a hole in the roof cornice said to have been made by a small cannonball fired by the attackers in 1780.</p><p>For almost a century the Schoharie County Historical Society has been collecting relics now displayed in the Old Stone Fort and its cement-block annex. Exhibits include electrified maps and a sound system interpreting Revolutionary War activities of the region. In front of the church is a grave of David Williams, one of the three men who captured Major John André at Tarrytown. The historical society is headquartered on the site and presently maintains six buildings there, including a library that specializes in genealogy dating to the seventeenth century. The site is open to the public from May until the end of October, Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 12 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Schoharie County Historical Society can be contacted at (518) 295-7192.</p><h3><b>Schuyler Mansion</b></h3><p><b>Schuyler Mansion</b> (the Pastures). <i>See</i>albany.</p><h3><b>Schuylerville</b></h3><p><b>Schuylerville.</b> <i>See</i>saratoga national historical park.</p><h3><a id="Seneca-IroquoisNationalMuseum"><b>Seneca-Iroquois National Museum</b> </a></h3><p><b>Seneca-Iroquois National Museum,</b> Salamanca.

The only important village in the central portion of the island during the Revolution, Setauket had been settled initially by Puritans from around Boston. The Battle of Setauket took place on 22 August 1777, when the Third Battalion of De Lancey's Loyalists held off a raiding force of five hundred Patriots ferried across the sound in whaleboats by Caleb Brewster. Another raid in the "whaleboat warfare" was led by Brewster on 10 December 1777, and it also was repulsed.</p><p>"The Culper Ring" that furnished Washington with valuable intelligence after its creation in August 1778 was centered at Setauket and built around a cell of prominent townsmen: Caleb Brewster, Benjamin Tallmadge, Abraham Woodhull ("Culper Senior"), Robert Townsend (who took over later as "Culper Junior"), and Austin Roe (the local tavernkeeper). All of these men except Tallmadge, who was not a secret agent until later in the war (see raynham hall), met at the home of Anna Strong to make their initial plans. She subsequently played a key role in signaling Caleb Brewster on the Connecticut shore when there were messages to be picked up.</p><p>A popular but reliable account of the ring's operation is <i>A Peculiar Service</i> by Corey Ford (Little, Brown and Company, 1965), a work distinguished by the excellent maps of New York City and the Setauket area during the Revolution. It is still available through internet booksellers.</p><p>The Anna Strong House burned many years ago; its unmarked site is on the high ground on the southern portion of Strong's Neck overlooking Little Bay. (Since this is more than 6 miles from the closest point on the Connecticut shore, one wonders about the story that Caleb Brewster watched her clothesline for coded signals.) Roe's Tavern was about half a mile east of the Caleb Brewster House. Built in 1703 and enlarged in 1735, it was moved in the 1930s to a hill off what is now called Old Post Road and is a private residence.</p><p>Caleb Brewster's home (c. 1665) stands in a plot of grass on the north side of N.Y. 25A in East Setauket, a few hundred yards east of Old Town Road. Recently restored, it is a simple saltbox house of one and a half stories with shingle siding, two chimneys, and a basement.</p><p>Abraham Woodhull's house has disappeared, but its site, overlooking Setauket Harbor, is marked on Dyke Road half a mile north of the Presbyterian Church (1811). Woodhull's grave, including bricks from the foundation of his home, is behind the latter church, which is on the site of two earlier structures, one of which was the Loyalist "fort" during the Battle of Setauket. (To reach the Woodhull house site from the green, drive eastward on Dyke Road from the Caroline Avenue junction and follow Dyke Road as it turns generally north along the edge of the harbor. The highway marker will be on the left, or west, half a mile from the starting point.)</p><p>Caroline Church is Setauket's gem. Built in 1729, the severely simple, white frame structure with a twisted steeple is said to be the second-oldest Episcopal Church building in the United States. It and the Presbyterian Church face the triangular village green on Main Street.</p><p>The Thompson House (c. 1700) is on North Country Road adjacent to the headquarters of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities (SPLIA). The society's museum house is a classic eighteenth-century saltbox featuring unusually high ceilings and fireplaces and exposed framing of heavy timber, and activities such as flax spinning, weaving, and dye-making are demonstrated in season. Of great architectural interest is the Sherwood-Jayne House on Old Post Road, East Setauket, another property of the SPLIA about 3 miles from the Thompson House. This house, another saltbox, is in a rural setting that includes a sheep pasture.

The region was a hideout for raiders, who offered a bounty of 50 acres for volunteers and $8 for Patriot scalps. Unable to get through the dense cedar swamp to surprise the enemy camp at night, and finding that Doxtader had moved the next morning (10 July 1781) to a good defensive position on higher ground, Willett resorted to an ancient tactical trick. Taking advantage of the cover provided by the dense woods that limited the enemy's visibility, Willett deployed his smaller forces in a crescent. Initially advancing his forces in the center and then having them fall back, the Patriot commander drew the enemy out of position and hit them with surprise fire from both flanks. He then counterattacked and drove the enemy off the field in confusion.</p><p>With a sketch of the battle and a large-scale map a visitor today can reconstruct the action. The terrain is still open farmland, and Cedar Swamp, where the Loyalist camp was located on 9 July 1781, survives a few hundred yards to the northwest of Sharon Center. South of the latter landmark at a distance of a few hundred yards is the draw into which Willett lured the Loyalists.</p><h3><a id="ShellsSchellsBush"><b>Shell's (Schell's) Bush</b> </a></h3><p><b>Shell's (Schell's) Bush,</b> about 5 miles north of modern Herkimer. This settlement was the scene of a heroic defense by a Patriot family in August 1781 (see german flats).</p><h3><a id="ShoemakerHouse"><b>Shoemaker House</b> </a></h3><p><b>Shoemaker House,</b> Mohawk Valley, in the town of Mohawk on West Main Street, on N.Y. 5S. A large historical marker, conspicuous in the paved parking area in front of a modern tavern, indicates the survival of a two-story frame house with hip roof where Rudolph Shoemaker operated his tavern. The place was known for its hospitality to Loyalists as well as to Patriots. The notorious Walter Butler of Butlersbury was captured here in 1777 while holding a midnight meeting to spark a Loyalist uprising to support St. Leger's siege of Fort Stanwix. In this vicinity 450 Loyalists and Indians under Joseph Brant and Captain William Caldwell are said to have hidden in a ravine before launching their famous raid on German Flats in September 1778.</p><h3><a id="Skenesboro"><b>Skenesboro</b> </a></h3><p><b>Skenesboro.</b> Now called Whitehall.</p><h3><b>Smith (Claudius) Caves</b></h3><p><b>Smith (Claudius) Caves,</b> near Tuxedo. <i>See</i>ramapo valley.</p><h3><a id="SmithJoshuaHettHouseSite"><b>Smith (Joshua Hett) House Site</b> </a></h3><p><b>Smith (Joshua Hett) House Site,</b> West Haverstraw, Rockland County. "The Treason House," as it is identified on the highway marker on U.S. 9W near the entrance to the New York State Rehabilitation Hospital, was the home of the man who played, innocently, a key role in revealing Benedict Arnold's plot to surrender West Point. A successful lawyer from a distinguished family, Smith had directed the Patriot secret service in the Hudson Highlands for Arnold's predecessor and was asked by Arnold to continue these duties. Smith was Arnold's agent in meeting Major John André on the <i>Vulture</i> and bringing him to a secret conference with Arnold in the woods about 4 miles from Smith's house. He was supposed to escort André back to the <i>Vulture</i>. When the latter became impossible, Arnold and André were put up in Smith's house, within the Patriot lines. From this place they watched the next day as the <i>Vulture</i> was forced by Patriot artillery to withdraw. Arnold than gave Smith the mission of escorting André through the American lines on the east side of the Hudson.</p><p>Arnold had not taken Smith into his confidence, and Smith did not know the real identity of André or the true nature of his business. Smith left "<a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy-biographies/john-anderson">John Anderson</a>" to complete the last 15 miles of his journey alone, and the unfortunate André was captured at Tarrytown.</p><p>Acquitted of being involved in Arnold's treason, Smith was nevertheless jailed by state authorities on suspicion of being a Loyalist. In May 1781 he escaped from Goshen, took refuge with the British, spent eight years in England (1783–1801), and died in 1818 in New York City. His property had not been confiscated, but most of his fortune was lost because he had not been able to attend to his affairs.</p><p>The house site is on a steep hill alongside the highway. A visitor can drive onto the large reservation of the state hospital for a view of Haverstraw Bay, where the <i>Vulture</i> was supposed to retrieve Major André. The site of the secret meeting in the woods 4 miles from here is not marked.</p><h3><b>Smith's Clove</b></h3><p><b>Smith's Clove,</b> near Monroe. <i>See</i>ramapo valley.</p><h3><a id="SpringsteelsFarm"><b>Springsteel's Farm</b> </a></h3><p><b>Springsteel's Farm,</b> about 1.5 miles west of Stony Point, Rockland County. In making their approach march for the storming of Stony Point, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/anthony-wayne">Anthony Wayne</a>'s troops began to arrive here about 8 p.m. on 15 July 1779. Extraordinary measures were taken to preserve secrecy, with the troops guarded so no traitor could slip away to warn the British. Wayne moved closer to Stony Point for a final reconnaissance, and while he was at Springsteel's he wrote a farewell letter in case he were killed in action. The Patriots resumed their advance about 11:30 p.m., generally following the line of today's Wayne Avenue (Route 77) but dividing into two columns soon after leaving Springsteel's.</p><p>The site of Springsteel Farm (as it is called on markers) is opposite the entrance gate to Camp Bullowa, a Boy Scout camp just 0.15 mile north of the intersection of the Crickettown-Franck Road with Wayne Avenue (Route 77). A direction marker on N.Y. 210 about 0.3 mile west of the junction of N.Y. 210 with U.S. 9W-202 in the village of Stony Point indicates that the site is about a mile north on a narrow road that winds and climbs through country only sparsely developed in modern times. No vestige remains of Springsteel's, but by visiting the spot one will see that it made an ideal "final assembly area." On the highest point along the present Wayne Avenue is the hill from which Wayne is alleged to have made his final reconnaissance; it is now occupied by a private residence.</p><h3><a id="StarksKnob"><b>Stark's Knob</b> </a></h3><p><b>Stark's Knob,</b> just north of Schuylerville, upper Hudson Valley. The great Patriot victory at Bennington (see bennington battlefield) was due primarily to the fact that John Stark refused to obey orders and join the main American army under Horatio Gates at Saratoga. It is all the more ironic that this same Stark, when he did get around to obeying his orders and joining Gates, was the man who put the cork in the bottle and sealed Burgoyne's fate. This cork was the possession of the hill north of Schuylersville now known as Stark's Knob. Burgoyne had decided to make one last effort to extricate his army when he discovered that his escape route was blocked here.</p><p>The site is poorly marked, but a visitor can find it by driving 0.2 mile south from the Mohawk River bridge that is just north of Schuylerville. A dirt road climbs steeply to the west from U.S. 4, and to the right are open fields about where Stark deployed.</p><h3><b>Staten Island</b></h3><p><b>Staten Island.</b> <i>See</i>new york city.</p><h3><a id="SteubenMemorial"><b>Steuben Memorial</b> </a></h3><p><b>Steuben Memorial,</b> about 20 miles north of +Utica, on Starr Hill Road, about 2.5 miles west of the intersection of Routes 12 and 28, near Remsen, Oneida. This State Historic Site contains a replica of the log house in which Steuben spent his summers and where the old bachelor died. His grave is nearby. The house contains the general's uniform, some of his furniture and other possessions, and a replica of the Ralph Earl portrait.</p><p>Friedrich Wilhelm Augustus von Steuben (1730–1794) is credited with transforming the Continental army from an undisciplined crowd into a force of professionals. Of particular significance was his teaching of standards of professionalism to the army's officers.</p><p>Steuben is an important and a colorful figure in United States history. With a letter from Benjamin Franklin introducing him to Washington as a "Lieutenant General in the King of Prussia's service," knowing no English and having a limited command of French, Steuben was soon put to work training the army at <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/valley-forge">Valley Forge</a>. When the results were proved in battle a few months later, Steuben was made a major general in the Continental army and inspector general. The next winter, 1778 to 1779, he prepared his "Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States." Later he set up a badly needed system of property accountability for the army.</p><p>He took part in the final military operations of the war in Virginia, commanding a division at Yorktown and giving Washington the benefit of his professional knowledge of siege warfare.</p><p>General Steuben became an American citizen, established residence in New York City after his discharge from the army in March 1784, and was a prominent social figure. In 1786 New York gave him 16,000 acres in the Mohawk Valley, and the Steuben Memorial is on this land.</p><p>Although fairly isolated in a picturesque rural region, the site is easily accessible from a nearby high-speed high-way and has great potential as a major historical attraction. In 2004 there were plans in the works for an expansion of the site. There are abundant picnicking facilities, no admission is charged, and the site is open daily from mid-May through <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/days-and-holidays/days-months-holidays-and-festivals/labor-day">Labor Day</a>.

This name was originally applied to the area of some 20,000 acres of rich farmland granted to Palatine settlers in 1723. (In old records it is spelled "Stoneraby," and nobody knows how the picturesque later version evolved.)</p><p>The Battle of Stone Arabia, 18 October 1780, took place just to the northeast of Palatine Bridge. Major land-marks have been preserved, but a little prior knowledge is needed for today's visitor to appreciate them.</p><p>After devastating the Schoharie Valley, some 1,500 battle-tested raiders under Sir John Johnson were marching up the north bank of the Mohawk, burning settlements and pillaging. General Robert Van Rensselaer had scraped together a force of Patriot militia that was moving some distance to the rear and on the other side of the river. In a position to intercept the raiders was a small body of about 130 Massachusetts levies (and a few others) under Colonel <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-brown">John Brown</a> at the fortified farm of Isaac Paris ("Fort Paris") in the village of Stone Arabia.</p><p>Van Rensselaer ordered Brown to march south and attack the head of Johnson's column while the main Patriot force closed up and hit them from the rear. Near the ruins of Fort Keyser the Massachusetts troops were decisively defeated. Brown and about forty of his men were killed, and the rest were routed; the raiders destroyed two old churches and many other buildings in the area before continuing the march toward Fort Klock.</p><p>The battlefield and the site of famous old Fort Keyser are indicated by highway markers in the picturesque farmland 2 miles north of Palatine Bridge on N.Y. 10. One sign points out the low, wooded ridge a few hundred yards to the south where the main enemy force was located initially. From the evidence of cannonballs and bullets found throughout the years in neighboring fields, Brown was advancing west along the general line of today's Route 10 when he walked into a well-planned ambuscade.</p><p>The site of Fort Keyser—built by Johannes Keyser in 1750—is indicated by a highway marker on Dillenback Road 0.3 of a mile east of Cook Corners (where N.Y. 10 makes its second 90-degree turn after leaving Palatine Bridge). This valley landmark disappeared in 1855, only a few years after a watercolor sketch was made by R. A. Grider; still to be seen is the place where it stood, now a weed-covered mound in a farm field about 300 yards south of the road. An inscribed stone of Fort Keyser has been identified in the foundation of the house nearby.</p><p>On N.Y. 10 north of Cook Corners 1.2 miles is the white frame Lutheran church rebuilt in 1792 after the older one was destroyed in 1780 by Sir John's raiders. It is on the site of the first log structure, which was erected in 1729.</p><p>About 100 yards farther north is a small architectural gem in a rural setting little despoiled by centuries of American progress. This is the Dutch Reformed Church, of luminous, light gray limestone, built in 1788 on the site of the one destroyed in 1780. Colonel John Brown lies in the ancient cemetery to the rear, and a monument to this colorful character, erected by his son in 1836, is in front of the church.</p><p>He was called John Brown of Pittsfield (Massachusetts) to distinguish him from all the others. Only thirty-six years old when killed in action—in fact, on his thirty-sixth birthday—he had packed a full life into those few years. After graduating from Yale (1771) and practicing law briefly in this area of New York, he had returned to his native New England. At the start of the Revolution he volunteered for a secret mission to Canada, charged with feeling out the spirit of rebellion in what the Patriots hoped to make "the fourteenth colony" and setting up an intelligence net. He is among those credited with suggesting that Fort Ticonderoga be captured by a surprise attack, and he took part in the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/ethan-allen">Ethan Allen</a> operation against the fort, though he abandoned Allen during a planned attack on Montreal. Later he was part of General Montgomery's column invading Canada along the Lake Champlain route, and had been promised a promotion to lieutenant colonel when Montgomery was killed at Quebec. Meanwhile, he had clashed with Arnold, who refused to recommend the promotion. Brown became Arnold's most dedicated enemy, using his lawyer's training to press formal charges of malfeasance and incompetence. Failing to remove Arnold, Brown resigned his military commission, returned to his civilian pursuits at Pittsfield, and published a broadside attack on Arnold.</p><p>The site of Fort Paris is indicated by a highway marker half a mile north of the stone church. It was on the slight rise about 200 yards east of the road. Colonel Isaac Paris, one of the regimental commanders who goaded General Herkimer into the ambush at Oriskany, was captured there and subsequently murdered by Loyalists.</p><p>Another 0.3 mile north is the site of Loucks Tavern, on Stone Arabia Road (County Highway 34). Here the Palatine District Committee of Safety met for the first time on 27 August 1774, "attended by a large number of the inhabitants," writes William W. Campbell in his <i>Annals of Tryon County</i> (1831). This spot is approximately the geographic center of the historic region then known as Stone Arabia, and now the Palatine Township of Montgomery County.</p><h3><a id="StonyPoint"><b>Stony Point</b> </a></h3><p><b>Stony Point,</b> near the community of Stony Point on the Hudson River, about 25 miles north of New York City and 12 miles south of West Point, on U.S. 9W and 202.</p><p>This was a place of strategic importance, not only for its location at the southern edge of the Hudson Highlands but also because it covered Kings Ferry. A miniature of West Point, it is a rocky promontory protruding half a mile into the river toward Verplanck's Point.</p><p>The Americans had concentrated their fortification efforts a few miles farther north, and Sir Henry Clinton's forces easily captured Stony Point and Verplanck's Point on 1 June 1779 when they moved up the Hudson to support Burgoyne's invasion from Canada. Although it quickly became apparent that the enemy was not going to continue his offensive up the Hudson, Washington was worried about the fact that the British were fortifying Stony Point and Verplanck's Point. When he learned from good intelligence reports that the works at Stony Point were not being completed quickly, Washington ordered General Wayne to take them by a <i>coup de main</i>—a quick, surprise attack.</p><p>The Americans moved from near Fort Montgomery toward their final assembly areas on 15 July 1779, taking elaborate precautions to preserve secrecy along the 15-mile line of march. Wayne received valuable information about the British garrison, which included a number of African American troops, from a slave named Pompey Lamb who spied for the Patriots. Shortly before midnight on 15 to 16 July the "forlorn hopes" of the flank columns started forward from the swampy ground that separates the 150-foot peak of Stony Point from the mainland. A third force, in the middle, made a diversionary attack that accomplished its purpose of drawing about half of the enemy defenders down from the hill and away from the main fortification there.</p><p>The fight lasted only fifteen minutes after the two flank columns converged almost simultaneously on the British fort, shortly after midnight. The British commander reported the loss of 20 killed, 74 wounded, 58 missing, and the rest of his 624 officers and men captured. The well-disciplined Americans won praise for taking so many prisoners.</p><p>General Wayne, who received a head wound early in the attack but retained command, reported that of 1,350 actually engaged he lost only 15 killed and 83 wounded.</p><p>A fiery French officer, scion of a noble family from Provence, won the $500 prize offered by Wayne for being the first man to enter the enemy works. François Louis Teissèdre de Fleury, who had come to America as a volunteer, had immediately distinguished himself and been commissioned a captain of engineers in May 1777. After doing engineering work around Philadelphia he was honored by a resolution of Congress for gallantry at the Brandywine, and was wounded after serving six weeks in the siege of Fort Mifflin (see philadelphia, under Pennsylvania). He subsequently saw action at Monmouth and Newport before eclipsing all his previous accomplishments at Stony Point. Granted nine months' leave, he went to France, returned to America with Rochambeau, and was decorated by the French for his performance at Yorktown.</p><p>Congress voted only eight medals during the Revolution, and three were for Stony Point: a gold one for Wayne and silver ones for Fleury and Major John Stewart, who commanded the advance party of the left column. The French officer did not get his until 1783, when by some bureaucratic alchemy the silver medal had been transformed into gold.</p><p>The British reacted swiftly to Wayne's victory, sinking the galley that was taking most of the twelve captured cannon to West Point and securing Verplanck's Point before the planned American attack against that place got going. Washington wisely decided that the defense of Stony Point would not be worth the effort, so he ordered the fortifications destroyed and abandoned. The British reoccupied them on 19 July, the day after Wayne left. The operation had little strategic value, but it was a morale booster, and it was impressive evidence of the military qualities finally being developed within the American army. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-biographies/edmund-burke">Edmund Burke</a>'s <i>Annual Register</i> for 1779 said the action "would have done honor to the most veteran soldiers." The French ambassador to Philadelphia, Gerard, studied reports of the battle carefully and wrote, "I am convinced that this action will … elevate the ideas of Europe about the military qualities of the Americans…."</p><p>Stony Point Battlefield is unspoiled. Within the state reservation there are extensive remains of the earthworks built during the Revolution, and historical markers identify the main points of interest in "Mad Anthony" Wayne's action. The rugged and heavily wooded promontory can be explored by trail (a road saves a climb to the top), and the view of the Hudson from there is splendid. There is a small but excellent museum.

The latter place is of interest not only for the great natural beauty of the 15-mile Genesee River gorge but also for the vestiges of Seneca culture preserved there in the museum and the Seneca Council House.</p><p>About four thousand Patriot troops under General John Sullivan and James Clinton had the mission of "total destruction and devastation" of the Iroquois settlements. All organized resistance having been broken at Newtown, the invaders were impeded only by their own ponderous supply train. Burning Indian towns, destroying crops, and casting covetous eyes on this new land, the Patriots moved northward to Seneca Lake, westward from the area of modern Geneva to the ancient Indian town of Genesee (near modern Genesco).</p><p>Here a patrol of twenty-six men under Lieutenant Thomas Boyd was virtually wiped out on 13 September 1779, and the two survivors were cruelly tortured to death the next day.</p><p>Worth mentioning is the Sullivan Memorial between Groveland and East Groveland, southeast of Genesco. It lists the "heroic scouts" killed here in the ambush. The Boyd-Parker Memorial, a few miles west of Genesco on U.S. Alternate 20, is at the site of Little Beard's Town. Here the wounded Thomas Boyd was interrogated and then tortured to death. Although the story persists in patriotic circles that Boyd heroically refused to reveal information, the report of John Butler reads, "The officer who is a very intelligent person says their army consists of near 5,000 Continental troops … [who] intend, according to his account, to come no further than Genesee." The memorial indicates that the second prisoner killed here was Sergeant Michael Parker. Another prisoner slaughtered by the Indians, here or earlier, was the celebrated Oneida scout and marksman named Hanyerry.</p><p>Sullivan's expedition was supposed to be joined in this area by Colonel Daniel Brodhead's force of six hundred troops that had moved from Fort Pitt up the Allegheny Valley. In an advance of 400 miles this column burned ten villages, collected much booty, defeated the Indians in one skirmish, but turned back 50 miles short of its rendezvous with Sullivan because its guides were inadequate. The projected attack on Niagara was therefore not made, and Sullivan started back after burning Genesee.</p><p>Retracing his steps to Seneca Castle, or Kanadesaga, the site of which is covered by modern Geneva, the Patriots continued east to <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/north-american-indigenous-peoples/cayuga-lake">Cayuga Lake</a>, moved south along both shores of this lake, and descended the Susquehanna to the Wyoming Valley (vicinity of modern Wilkes-Barre).</p><p>Sullivan had failed in his assigned mission of taking Niagara. He failed to destroy the ability of the Iroquois to continue their border warfare, the raids of 1780 and 1781 being more frequent and more vicious than in previous years. But in burning their crops and villages, Sullivan condemned the Iroquois to a winter of harsh starvation that had serious long-term consequences for their society.</p><p>If the Patriots showed little real military aptitude in this expedition, they revealed no lack of genius for real-estate development. Many of the Continental troops involved were New Englanders, who returned to their thin-soil and rocky home states with appetizing reports on the Iroquois country. "The Military Tract" was set aside by New York in 1782 to give bounties for service in the Revolution. It comprised more than 1.5 million acres of Iroquois country—all of the present Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca Counties, and portions of Tompkins, Schuyler, Wayne, and Oswego. When drawing for lots started on the first day of 1791, many veterans had sold their claims to speculators. Meanwhile, New York and Massachusetts had settled their differences over control of western lands, and the rest of western New York was taken from the Indians so whites could move in. Today's tourist will find many historical markers and sites associated with post-Revolution land purchases and their development.</p><p>Five states participated in an elaborate celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Sullivan-Clinton campaign, locating the forty-eight campsites and erecting handsome bronze plaques along the route of march. The latter remain in place to guide today's tourist. Highway markers pertaining to the expedition have disappeared mysteriously as certain ninety-nine-year leases with the Indians of western New York came due for renegotiation.</p><h3><b>Sullivan Memorial</b></h3><p><b>Sullivan Memorial</b> (State Historical Site). <i>See</i>sullivanclinton expedition.</p><h3><a id="TappanHistoricDistrict"><b>Tappan Historic District</b> </a></h3><p><b>Tappan Historic District,</b> Rockland County. Two and a half miles west of the Hudson River landing opposite Dobbs Ferry, about midway between Kings Ferry and New York City, Tappan was an important camping area throughout the Revolution, and Washington's headquarters on several important occasions. The Tappan Patent was settled almost a century before the Revolution, and today it preserves much of its original character. Most of Tappan's historic sites lie within an 85-acre historic district established in 1966.</p><p>The little De Wint House at 20 Livingston Street, recently designated as a Washington Masonic Shrine and a National Historic Landmark, is a Dutch brick-and-sandstone structure built about 1700 by Daniel de Clark. John de Windt was a West Indian planter who later owned it. While using this building as his headquarters, Washington gave Benedict Arnold command of the Hudson Highlands, an assignment the turncoat had been angling for, and it was here that Washington made the hard decision that the charming young Major John André would suffer a spy's fate. While back in the De Wint House in May 1783 Washington met with General Sir Guy Carleton to arrange the peaceful British evacuation of New York City. In 1932 the Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York bought the house and started restoring it.</p><p>The 1776 House, or Mabie Tavern, is on Main Street just south of Old Tappan Road. Around 1753 the house was sold to Casparus Mabie, who established a tavern there. The Orangetown Resolutions were signed here on 4 July 1774; this document was hailed by local historians as anticipating the Declaration of Independence by exactly two years, though it is difficult to determine any connection other than the date. The Old 76 House, as it is usually called, is an upscale eatery billed as "New York's Oldest Restaurant." Phone: (845) 359-5476.</p><p>John André was a prisoner in Mabie Tavern during his trial in the Dutch Reformed Church a short distance away. (The existing church structure is the third on its site, having been built in 1835; André's trial was in the second.) André's prison room was preserved for more than fifty years, then converted into a ballroom, but in 1897 the entire building was restored. It meets most of the criteria for registration as a National Historic Landmark.</p><p>The site of André's hanging and burial is marked by a monument on André Hill just south of Old Tappan Road. (From the Village Green in the center of town go 0.4 mile west on Old Tappan Road and turn south at the highway marker pertaining to the André Monument. Climb half a mile up a rather steep grade, through an attractive residential district, to the large polished stone monument within a circular fence.) André's remains were moved to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-physical-geography/westminster">Westminster Abbey</a> in 1821 and placed near the monument previously erected there by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/british-and-irish-history-biographies/george-iii">George III</a> (near Poets' Corner). In 1847 a small boulder was placed on the original grave. "A more elegant and durable monument should be erected upon the spot," Lossing commented after sketching it in 1850, and this has been done.</p><p>While at Tappan during this distasteful episode, Washington issued the instructions that led to the daring exploit of Sergeant Major John Champe. The plan was for a volunteer from "Light Horse Harry" Lee's legion to take on the role of a deserter, enter the British lines, and kidnap Benedict Arnold from his quarters on lower Broadway in New York City. Champe succeeded in being accepted as a volunteer in Arnold's legion, but was ordered off on an expedition to raid his native Virginia before he could make his attempt to capture Arnold. Unable to effect his escape from the British until Arnold's legion returned from Virginia, Champe eventually rejoined Lee in the Carolinas, and only then could the truth of his "desertion" from the Continental army be told. Tappan was the scene of Sergeant Major Champe's most hazardous feat, that of leaving the American lines. For further information contact the Tappantown Historical Society, P.O.

Natural beauty, historic importance, and a superlative reconstruction combine to make Fort Ticonderoga and its associated works a national landmark of the greatest significance and interest. No education is needed to appreciate the natural beauty. But the more one knows about the history of this site and the efforts of a few private citizens to preserve it, the more richly a visit will be rewarded.</p><p>"Between the waters" was the meaning of the Indian name for this place, and Ticonderoga is a corruption of their word "Cheonderoga," or "Tyeonderoga." In a position to control the 2-mile portage between Lakes Champlain and George as well as the entrance to Wood Creek (which led to the Great Carrying Place whose Hudson River terminus was Fort Edward), Ticonderoga was a critical spot on the natural route between Canada and <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/thirteen-colonies">the Thirteen Colonies</a>.</p><p>During the Colonial Wars the French first fortified Crown Point (1731), about 12 miles north of Ticonderoga. (A visitor viewing the terrain, he might speculate on whether Crown Point is not a better strategic position than Ticonderoga for a fortress to control Lake Champlain.)</p><p>When the British built Fort William Henry on the south end of Lake George (see lake george village), the French in 1755 started fortifying Ticonderoga. One reason for pushing so far south was that their new fort at Crown Point had been started "on wrong principles." The French first put a military road along the 2-mile portage between the lakes (now Portage Road in the village of Ticonderoga). Then they started building a fort where the present reconstruction stands, first using oak logs and later replacing these with stone.</p><p>In the summer of 1758 the fort (named Carillon because water fell from Lake George with a sound like "a chime of bells") was almost finished when it was threatened by the largest British army yet fielded in North America. General James Abercromby was preparing to attack from the direction of Lake George with an expedition that numbered six thousand of Britain's finest regulars and nine thousand provincials.</p><p>The marquis de Montcalm reached Fort Carillon on 30 June 1758 to take command. He had fewer than four thousand troops, and reports indicated they would be attacked within a few days by up to six times that number. Montcalm sent strong detachments forward to detect and delay the enemy's approach, but he took another action that revealed his military genius. Instead of passively defending the fort, he deployed the bulk of his command in the woods about three-quarters of a mile to the west. Here his engineers laid out fieldworks on the forward slopes of a wooded hill, and his troops performed the prodigious labor of erecting abatis and a great wall of logs. All this was done in a few days—from decision to the issue of implementing orders to accomplishment.</p><p>Victory was on the side of the smaller battalions and the smarter leaders. Abercromby suffered one of the cost-liest defeats in British history, losing almost 2,000 in killed and wounded. The French had 377 casualties.</p><p>Today a visitor approaches Fort Ticonderoga along a paved road of the 1,000-acre reservation that has several monuments commemorating this French victory and the exceptional gallantry of the British and American battalions involved. The famous Black Watch (Forty-second Highlanders) and Royal Americans (now the King's Royal Rifle Corps of the British army) did the heaviest fighting. The present access road corresponds with the British axis of advance on the fort and gives a visitor an appreciation of Montcalm's wisdom in choosing his defensive position. Those casualty figures prove much more conclusively than any bronze plaques that this was one of the hardest battles ever fought on American soil.</p><p>Almost exactly a year later the French were forced to abandon Ticonderoga when its capture by Lord Jeffrey Amherst was imminent. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/ethan-allen">Ethan Allen</a> and Benedict Arnold were among the colonial officers in this operation (and sixteen years later they were to pay Ticonderoga another visit together). Amherst started repairs on the fort, which the French had tried to destroy on their departure by setting fires and leaving a slow match that exploded the powder magazine under the southeast bastion.</p><p>When the British won Canada, the military significance of Ticonderoga virtually disappeared. At the start of the American Revolution it was a military depot in the wilderness, guarded by a small garrison whose chief enemy was boredom. Stone forts of this period had the advantage of requiring less upkeep than wooden structures, which would rot away every few years and need rebuilding. But constant repairs are needed to keep up masonry walls in climates where frost works on the mortar. Stone masons were scarce in the American wilderness of two centuries ago, and as early as 1767 Fort Ticonderoga had been reported as being "in a very declining condition."</p><p>But a goodly supply of artillery was still there, and when the shooting started in 1775 this was one item the Patriots sorely lacked. Several men are credited with conceiving the plan of capturing this isolated and neglected British post. Massachusetts gave the mission to Benedict Arnold, but Ethan Allen of Vermont organized an expedition that moved out before Arnold's force could get on the scene. Arnold raced on to Castleton, Vermont, accompanied only by a servant, and tried to seize command from Allen. (Historians still disagree as to what command authority Arnold had, if any. None of his own troops were engaged, and Allen's <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/green-mountain-boys">Green Mountain Boys</a> had flatly refused to take any orders from Arnold.)</p><p>There were delays in getting boats from Skenesboro (now Whitehall) and other places to Hand's Cove, Vermont. Surprise was essential, so the decision was made to use what boats were available to ferry as many men as possible across Lake Champlain for a dawn attack. With eighty-three men and a number of officers, Allen achieved complete surprise.</p><p>The dramatic scene of the surrender has been recreated by innumerable writers and artists. Rudely awakened, an officer appeared at the door of his quarters "with his breeches in his hand," as Allen reported it, and demanded by what authority these rowdies were calling for surrender of the fort. "In the name of the great Jehovah, and the Continental Congress," was the stirring reply. Historians do not deny that an officer could have said this, but they seriously question that he actually did: no contemporary account records the phrase, and it was four years after the event that Allen first entered it into the historical record. Artists and popular writers also have neglected the point that it was not Captain Delaplace who stood trousers in hand to receive this oratorical thunderbolt, but a recently joined subordinate, Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham. "I asked a number of questions, expecting to amuse them [that is, play for time] till our people fired," he wrote in his report. Delaplace, meanwhile, got dressed, appeared at the head of the stairs, and quite sensibly surrendered the fort.</p><p>How to transport all this cumbersome loot to the Boston lines? Colonel <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/henry-knox">Henry Knox</a>, a twenty-five-year-old military amateur, was appointed commander of the Continental Regiment of Artillery and ordered by Washington to go to draw his equipment at Ticonderoga. Knox had previously submitted a plan for this undertaking, which called for the use of sledges hauled over the snow by oxen. (This is one reason why the cannon, captured on 10 May, were not moved sooner.) To summarize the story of his "noble train of artillery," as Knox called it, on 5 December 1775 Knox reached Ticonderoga, and the next day forty-three cannon and sixteen mortars were removed from the fort. By 9 December they had all been taken across the portage and loaded on scows. On 7 January 1776 the 120,000 pounds of matériel were assembled around Lake George Village for what should have been the worst part of the trip. But the 300 miles of difficult terrain were covered in less than three weeks. The route was from Fort Edward to old Saratoga (Schuylerville today), Albany, Kinderhook, and Claverack, then east through steep grades and heavy snows of the Berkshires to Framingham, 20 miles west of Boston. Emplacement of the guns on Dorchester Heights in March forced the British to evacuate Boston.</p><p>Ticonderoga was by now of great emotional importance to Patriots—the "Gibraltar of America," "Key to a Continent." Young John Trumbull (1756–1843), later famous as "Painter of the Revolution," and the Frenchtrained Polish military engineer <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/thaddeus-kosciuszko">Thaddeus Kosciuszko</a> (1746–1817) were put in charge of the fortification work. But the place fell quickly to Burgoyne's expedition in July 1777. There were charges of gross incompetence and treason. Around campfires of New England troops the story of the "silver bullets of Ticonderoga" was circulated credulously: "Gentleman Johnny" Burgoyne had bought the fort with silver bullets fired over its walls. (In the museum at Ticonderoga there is indeed a silver bullet, but it has quite a different story. Messages were sometimes carried in hollow silver bullets that could be swallowed by the bearer if he were captured. This bullet was purged from the spy carrying Sir Henry Clinton's message of 8 October 1777 about his capture of Forts Clinton and Montgomery in the Bear Mountain area.)</p><p>Patriot commanders on the spot knew that Ticonderoga was untenable with the resources at their disposal. Trumbull had warned General Arthur St. Clair, the newly assigned commander at Ticonderoga, that British guns on Mount Defiance could hit the fort. This 800-foot hill had never been occupied in the military history of Ticonderoga, and on some maps it was marked "inaccessible." The defenders knew better. Benedict Arnold and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/anthony-wayne">Anthony Wayne</a> walked St. Clair up the hill to show him how the British could emplace guns there. But St. Clair did not have enough troops to defend Mount Defiance. He did not have sufficient men even to defend properly the boom and bridge of boats connecting Ticonderoga to the Mount Independence works on the Vermont shore. He lacked "naval support" to counter the British ships and gunboats.</p><p>Faced with these realities, Schuyler and St. Clair decided that Ticonderoga was untenable, but that a show of resistance had to be made. The British forward elements took Mount Hope without any resistance from the outpost there. They wasted little time in getting four 12-pounders up Mount Defiance, and the Americans prepared to withdraw secretly from Fort Ticonderoga to consolidate their defenses around Mount Independence. The significance of the enemy guns on Mount Defiance was not that they could pound the fort into submission: the range was too great for precision fire, and, even more important, not enough ammunition could be supplied over the improvised road for a proper bombardment. The real value of these guns was that they could wreck the floating bridge and boats brought up to evacuate the garrison.</p><p>The well-planned American withdrawal turned into a comedy of errors. One of St. Clair's generals was a French volunteer with the splendid name Chevalier Matthias Alexis de Rochefermoy, "a worthless drunkard" in the judgment of at least one close observer. General Fermoy (as he was known in America) not only failed to give his troops on Mount Independence warning orders about the night withdrawal, but also, when he got ready to leave at about 3 a.m., for some reason set fire to his quarters. This illuminated the scene, gave away the plot, and prompted a vigorous reaction from the enemy. Four gunners posted to fire the length of the bridge of boats were found by the British to be in a drunken sleep, so Burgoyne's men crossed the quarter-mile water gap unimpeded.</p><p>When the news of Ticonderoga's fall reached King George III, he cried out: "I have beat them! I have beat all the Americans!"</p><p>Ticonderoga became a critical post on Burgoyne's overextended line of communications as he blundered farther and farther south to disaster at Saratoga. In late September 1777 a surprise attack on Ticonderoga was led by Colonel John Brown of Pittsfield. Brown achieved surprise, captured three hundred of the enemy, and liberated one hundred American prisoners. (The latter had been used for labor and kept at night in a barn some distance from the fort.) Lacking heavy artillery to attack the fort itself, Brown moved south along Lake George in captured boats with the idea of taking the enemy supply point on Diamond Island. When the wind turned against him and the enemy garrison was alerted before he could launch a surprise attack, Brown made for the east shore, burned his boats, and rejoined the Patriot forces under Benjamin Lincoln in Vermont.</p><p>After Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga the British abandoned Ticonderoga, burning the barracks and buildings on both sides of the lake. The place was never again garrisoned.</p><h2><a id="Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a></h2><p>Historic Fort Ticonderoga and surrounding lands were ceded to Columbia and Union Colleges by the state of New York in 1803. When Benson Lossing visited the spot in 1848 he wrote: "For more than half a century the walls of the fort have been common spoil for all who chose to avail themselves of such a convenient quarry; and the proximity of the lake affords rare facility for builders to carry off the plunder…. Year after year the ruins thus dwindle, and, unless … government shall prohibit the robbery, this venerable landmark of history will soon have no abiding place among us."</p><p>A New York merchant named William Ferris Pell leased the lands in 1816 and bought them four years later. In 1908 a descendant, Stephen Pell, started the remarkable job of reconstruction, which was continued by his son, John H. G. Pell. Today the Fort Ticonderoga Association, a not-for-profit organization, maintains the site, operates a superb historical museum, and publishes an historical quarterly. The Place d'Armes was covered with 6 to 7 feet of rubble, and the west bastions lay under twice that burden. But the debris had preserved the plan of the fort and vital details of its construction. At least 50 percent of the walls were rebuilt by putting back stones that had fallen into the moat. Hardware has been copied from examples found in the ruins. Tiles for the roof and floors have been made by the same methods as in the 1700s, stones have been reset in the same type of mortar as originally, and rough-hewn oak beams have been brought in from the Adirondacks. The wealth of objects found during excavations has been preserved in the fort museum.</p><p>The ramparts bristle with a remarkable collection of eighteenth-century artillery of all types. Only two pieces ever saw service at Ticonderoga, but the others were collected in America, from Europe, and from several West Indian islands. Fourteen large 24-pounders were presented by the British government, having been cast for use in America during the Revolution but never shipped.</p><p>In the south barracks is a museum on three floors, and the basement of the west barracks has an important gun collection. Highlights of the uncluttered and well-organized museum are: a waterway exhibit (canoes and a bateau); Indian trade goods; sixteen wall cases representing periods of the fort's history; an unusual collection of engraved powder horns, polearms, portraits, and uniforms; two reconstituted Indian graves; and many Indian artifacts. A scale model of Mount Independence includes models of the various vessels built for Arnold's Lake Champlain fleet at Whitehall and fitted out at Mount Independence.</p><p>From the previously mentioned model in the south barracks a visitor can see the site's appearance at the time of the Revolution, when most of its timber had been stripped off. The star fort on Mount Independence was more strongly garrisoned than Fort Ticonderoga itself, better provisioned and well outposted. The historic site offers public educational programs and reenactments and is open to the public 10 May to 24 October from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Phone: (518) 585-2821.</p><h2><a id="MountDefianceAndMountHope">MOUNT DEFIANCE AND MOUNT HOPE</a></h2><p>A toll road to the 853-foot summit of Mount Defiance provides a magnificent panorama for great distances in all directions. On a clear day one can see Mount Marcy, highest point in New York, some 37 miles to the northwest, and sometimes 60 miles down the lake to Westport. "The view from this lofty hill is one of great interest and beauty," wrote Benson Lossing after scrambling up its western slope in August 1848, "including almost every variety of natural scenery, and a region abounding with historical associations." The scene has changed little since his day, except that now one drives up and has the advantage of a taped narrative that explains what one is looking at. Called Sugar Loaf Hill before acquiring its present name, this is where the colorful British General William Phillips emplaced a gun battery within range of Fort Ticonderoga. "Where a goat can go a man can go, and where a man can go he can drag a gun," said this legendary hero of the Royal Artillery—and they went. Already promoted over the heads of many seniors for gallantry and "superlative practice" in Germany, he was Burgoyne's second in command in 1777 and was promoted to major general after the capture of Ticonderoga. Taken prisoner with Burgoyne's army and exchanged in October 1780, he led raids in Virginia and died of <a class="interlinked" href="/medicine/diseases-and-conditions/pathology/typhoid-fever">typhoid fever</a> in Petersburg. He is buried there.</p><p>Mount Hope is owned and managed by the Fort Ticonderoga Association and has the same visiting hours as Fort Ticonderoga. This outpost position of Fort Ticonderoga changed hands many times between its establishment in 1755 by Montcalm and its final occupation by the Patriots in 1781. The existing blockhouse was built in 1776 by Colonel Jonathan Brewer's Massachusetts State Regiment of Artificers. An able artificer himself is the man who began developing the site in 1946, Carroll V. Lonergran. He grew up on a farm that included Fort Mount Hope, and did a great deal of its restoration. Lonergran recovered cannon, cannonballs, bar shot, and the ruins of a gunboat from Lake Champlain.</p><h3><a id="UnadillaRegion"><b>Unadilla Region</b> </a></h3><p><b>Unadilla Region.</b> The Unadilla River, now the boundary between Chenango and Otsego Counties, was the dividing line between Iroquois country and the area open to white settlement by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1786). When the Revolution started there was a small place known as Unadilla where the river of that name enters the Susquehanna. The site is about 5 miles downstream from modern Unadilla. In June 1777 Joseph Brant showed up with about seventy-five Indian warriors and demanded that the white settlers furnish him with supplies. The Patriot element of the unprotected settlement started packing up, and for the rest of the war years Unadilla was a base for Indian and Loyalist raids against the frontiers of New York and Pennsylvania. The meeting between Brant and Herkimer (see herkimer house) took place on the river flats about a mile and a half east of modern Bainbridge. The historical area marker pertaining to this event ("the Lost Peace") is found on N.Y. 51 between Mount Upton and Gilbertsville, and another marker ("Unadilla Region") is between Bainbridge and Afton on N.Y. 7.</p><p>From Unadilla, Joseph Brant launched his raid of 13 September 1778 on German Flats. The Patriots retaliated with a punitive expedition that destroyed Indian castles in the Unadilla area (2-16 October). Brant's base at Oquaga was among the places burned, and the Mohawk chief responded with his notorious Cherry Valley Massacre.</p><p>Even after the Sullivan-Clinton Expedition of 1779, which destroyed all major Iroquois settlements, including Unadilla and Oquaga, these places continued to serve as rendezvous points and bases for raids. At Unadilla the Indians under Brant and Cornplanter linked up with Sir John Johnson's forces from Oswego in September 1780 for the raid that devastated Schoharie Valley, and moving up the Mohawk Valley through Stone Arabia and Johnstown, inflicted more damage.</p><p>After the Catskill Turnpike was constructed early in the nineteenth century, the modern village of Unadilla began to grow.</p><h3><a id="ValcourBay"><b>Valcour Bay</b> </a></h3><p><b>Valcour Bay,</b> west shore of Lake Champlain, 7 miles south of Plattsburgh. Benedict Arnold's amazing performance here in 1776 saved the northern frontier from British conquest and delayed Burgoyne's campaign of 1777.</p><p>When the American invasion of Canada in 1775 to 1776 failed, General Sir Guy Carleton undertook to gain control of Lake Champlain as the first step in a counter-offensive that could have fatally split the colonies along the line of the Hudson River. But because Arnold was fighting back with the few American ships on the lake and was building more, Carleton had to stop long enough to form a flotilla of his own. This delay probably was fatal because it did not leave him time to take Ticonderoga and push on to Albany before winter set in.</p><p>The site of the critical Battle of Valcour Bay has remained virtually unspoiled. Valcour Island is a high, rocky, and wooded island about 2 miles long and 1.25 miles wide. By 1972 the state of New York had purchased most of the island and included it within the Adirondack State Park. In many ways it has changed little in appearance since the October day in 1776 when Carleton's Indian allies climbed its trees to deliver harassing fire onto the decks of Arnold's improvised fleet. The channel between the island and the lake shore is three-quarters of a mile wide, divided into two bays by a high bluff that juts out from the island. The shore of the lake has been built up to some degree, but little damage has been done to the bay as a historical landmark.</p><p>In addition to the points already mentioned, the battle is remarkable for several other reasons. Lake Champlain is a most unusual place for a naval battle to take place because it is landlocked and very narrow. Ships were in constant danger of being bottled up and destroyed by attack from the shore. Most lake craft were of the small rowing type, with sails for use only when the wind was from the rear. Nobody knew much about shallow-water sailing craft in those days, and when an ingenious British officer of Carleton's invading force invented a centerboard (or drop keel), his superiors were not smart enough to approve its adoption.</p><p>Carleton tried to move schooners and a large gundalow from the St. Lawrence into Lake Champlain by using rollers to bypass the rapids of the Richelieu River, but this otherwise feasible operation was frustrated by soft ground. He therefore had to disassemble these craft, carry the parts overland, and put them back together at St. Johns. Gunboats and provision boats (bateaux) were likewise carried past the rapids, many of them having been received in frame from England. Others were built at St. Johns, including a 422-ton sailing scow, <i>Thunderer</i>, 92 feet in length and 33 in beam, carrying a complement of three hundred men and fourteen guns. Being unable to work to windward because of its flat bottom, <i>Thunderer</i> did not figure in the action on the lake.</p><p>When the Americans withdrew from Canada they had three vessels captured in earlier operations: the schooners <i>Liberty</i> and <i>Royal Savage</i> and the large sloop <i>Enterprise</i>. The schooner <i>Revenge</i> was being built at Ticonderoga, and frame timber was evacuated from St. Johns to build the cutter <i>Lee</i> at Skenesboro.</p><p>Arnold was an experienced seaman, having sailed his own ships to the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/caribbean-political-geography/west-indies">West Indies</a> and Canada before the Revolution. He was also a human dynamo, and even as he fought the desperate rear-guard action of the American army as the British drove it from Canada in June 1776, Arnold apparently was forming his own plans for building a fleet on Lake Champlain to challenge their further advance. Two months later, on 24 August, he had ten craft ready, and on this date he sailed north from Crown Point to start his own naval war with the British. On 4 October the British started south with a large flotilla, having gotten underway three weeks earlier with land operations.</p><p>Although Valcour Bay turned out to be the ideal place for the improvised American fleet to fight the vastly superior British flotilla, Arnold had moved into it on 23 September merely because it was a good anchorage. Carleton was sailing cautiously south when, on 10 October, he learned that the American fleet was somewhere in the vicinity of Cumberland Head. The next day he shot past Valcour Island with a strong wind and had gone 2 miles beyond his quarry before he realized it.</p><p>Arnold now had fifteen vessels under his command, three of the captured craft mentioned above (the <i>Liberty</i> was off on another mission) and twelve of those built by his superhuman efforts since June. Starting his troops working with available tools in an improvised boatyard at Skenesboro (now Whitehall), Arnold had called for and gotten craftsmen and materials from Albany and the coastal ports. More than two hundred men eventually showed up, commanding exorbitant wages but getting the work done. Critical naval supplies and armament were available because the shipyards in New York and Philadelphia were blockaded.</p><p>Knowing that his craft would be manned by inexperienced men, Arnold rigged his four galleys with short masts and lateen sails, giving them the minimum amount of canvas and cordage for his landsmen to fumble with. These galleys, all but one finished in time for the battle, were about 72 feet on deck, 20 feet beam, and a little over 6 feet in the hold. Their complement was eighty men. Although the armament was varied somewhat, the <i>Washington</i> mounted two 18-pounders, two 12-pounders, two 9-pounders, four 4-pounders, one 2-pounder, and eight swivel guns.</p><p>One of the eight gundalows in action at Valcour Bay was recovered in 1935 and is on display in the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/smithsonian-institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> in Washington, D.C. Built to carry one 12-pounder and two 9-pounders, the gundalows were essentially rowboats, although they were rigged with two square sails on a single mast and could be very fast in a favoring wind. Pointed at both ends, the gundalow <i>Philadelphia</i> as salvaged and now exhibited is 54 feet in length, 15 feet in beam, and approximately 5 feet deep. It was constructed almost entirely of oak, and the hull timbers were still in place when she was lifted 57 feet from the sandy lake bottom near the mid-channel of Valcour Bay. A cannonball remained lodged in the hull, and two shot holes are visible. The mast, nearly 36 feet high, had only the top section missing. In addition to its three cannon, the hull contained shot, cooking utensils, tools, buttons, buckles, and human bones. The <i>Philadelphia</i> and the schooner <i>Royal Savage</i> were the only American vessels left behind by Arnold at Valcour Bay, and the latter ship, which burned and exploded, was salvaged in 1934. The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum has a working replica of the <i>Philadelphia</i> at Basin Harbor, Vermont.</p><p>The Battle of Valcour Bay, 11 October 1776, started with the British fleet coming about and heading for Arnold's little fleet in the south bay. Arnold's first concern was to lure the enemy into engaging him from this direction, against the wind, rather than sailing back around the island and entering the channel from the north. Ordering most of his vessels to form a line of battle across the channel just south of the high bluff on Valcour Island, Arnold had sent the schooner <i>Revenge</i> out to lure the enemy back. (He was not sure that they had detected the presence of the American fleet in the bay.) Four of his fastest vessels—<i>Royal Savage</i> and the galleys <i>Congress, Trumbull</i>, and <i>Washington</i>—sallied forth to do what damage they could to the British in the initial phase of the action, and also to draw the enemy into attacking from this direction. The stratagem succeeded, but the <i>Royal Savage</i> ran aground on the southwest tip of the island and was given a crippling broadside by the British schooner <i>Carleton</i>. The latter then got into trouble with the same treacherous winds of the narrow channel that had done in the <i>Royal Savage</i>, and to keep from being blown straight into the American line the <i>Carleton</i> had to throw out anchors. The other British sailing vessels could not work their way against the wind to support the <i>Carleton</i>, which was receiving the massed fire of the American line, but about seventeen British gunboats came up on line with it. At a range of about 350 yards the general engagement lasted from about 12:30 until dusk, which began to fall around 5 p.m. The British ships then withdrew to a line 600 or so yards farther south and continued their firing until dark.</p><p>By all rights the British should have been able to destroy the trapped American flotilla the next day, but Benedict Arnold again proved his military genius. Taking advantage of a dark, foggy night and a favoring wind, he slipped out in single file through the British fleet. The wind then turned, however, and, despite ten hours of backbreaking rowing and pumping, the last five of Arnold's battered craft had covered only 8 miles. The <i>Enterprise, Revenge</i>, and <i>Trumbull</i> made good their escape to Crown Point, where they joined the <i>Liberty</i>. The rest of Arnold's fleet was destroyed in a two-day pursuit. He beached his surviving craft, <i>Congress</i> and four gundalows, in Buttonmold Bay, near modern Panton, Vermont, and burned them with their colors flying. That night he led his two hundred survivors to Crown Point, about 10 miles away.</p><h3><a id="VanAlstyneHouse"><b>Van Alstyne House</b> </a></h3><p><b>Van Alstyne House,</b> Mohawk Valley, in Canajoharie on Moyer Street near N.Y. 5S. Central location and solid construction of this long, low stone house made it a popular meeting place for Patriots throughout the Revolution. At least sixteen meetings of the Tryon County Committee of Safety took place here; Washington was a visitor in 1783. It is now a private clubhouse. Marte Janse (or Martin Gerritse) Van Alstyne built the one-and-a-half-story house in 1749 or 1750. It remained in good structural condition until the Fort Rensselaer Club restored and furnished it.

The village grew up around the Upper Van Cortlandt Manor House, which still stands, much altered, as the Cortlandt NursingHomeonOregonStreet.Washingtonoften stayed here. St. Peter's Church, an exceedingly simple brick structure built and opened in 1767 for the Van Cortlandt tenants, is a charming example of an eighteenth-century Anglican chapel. The cemetery contains the grave of General Seth Pomeroy, who died 19 February 1777 in Peekskill. This elderly veteran of the Colonial Wars, who had fought as a private on Bunker Hill, was on his way to join the army in New Jersey as a major general of Massachusetts militia when he died of pleurisy. There is a monument to John Paulding, a Peekskill man lionized for his role in the capture of André. The graves of fifty-four Revolutionary soldiers are here, and a monument to these Peekskill men is near St. Peter's. The site of Dusenbury Tavern, where André was put up when en route to Tappan (see tappan historic district), is marked on Oregon Road north of St. Columbanus Church. Gallows Hill Road leads north from the village to the hill where a tablet memorializes the hanging of a Loyalist spy. It continues to Soldier's Spring, where a Patriot was killed by the British on 9 October 1777 when they occupied Peekskill. This road is the colonial route to Albany and leads to the Continental Village Site. The Cortlandt Historical Society organizes tours of local sites if given proper notice.

In 1777 it was headquarters for Generals Montgomery, Schuyler, and Gates, and here took place the planning that led to the decisive American victory at Saratoga. In the War of 1812 the house again was a military headquarters.

The eastern end of strategic Kings Ferry, it was defended by Fort Lafayette until the small garrison of that place (one officer and seventy-two troops from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/north-carolina">North Carolina</a>) surrendered to overwhelming British strength on 3 June 1779. The British built several earthworks on Verplanck's Point and tied them together with an extensive system of abatis. A year later the position was back in American hands.</p><p>In the interesting little river town now called Verplanck Point there are no vestiges of Revolutionary War works. The site of Fort Lafayette is covered by modern homes. To reach this spot, continue southwest on Broadway through the center of town and turn right on Third Street. Bear left on Lafayette Street and follow it a short distance to the top of the hill.</p><h3><a id="WashingtonHeadquartersHasbrouckHouse"><b>Washington Headquarters (Hasbrouck House)</b> </a></h3><p><b>Washington Headquarters (Hasbrouck House),</b> 84 Liberty Street, in the center of Newburgh at the intersection of Washington Street. The commanding view of the Hudson is obscured by buildings, but the historic house stands in a 7-acre park that preserves something of its original setting. A two-story museum (1910) adjoins the exceptionally well-preserved house, and the park contains monuments and cannon. The site has special significance for preservationists, its acquisition in 1850 by local citizens having set a precedent for the establishment of historical house museums in America.</p><p>The house was used by Washington as a headquarters and residence for almost seventeen months at the end of the Revolution (April 1782–August 1783), longer than he remained anywhere else during the war. During this period he met the greatest challenges to his personal leadership and showed the qualities that earn him the title Father of His Country. First he flatly and candidly rejected the proposal that he head a monarchy in America. Then he met the so-called Newburgh Conspiracy head-on and flattened it (see new windsor cantonment). Finally, among the historic documents he drafted at Newburgh, his circular letter to the governors of the states outlined his views on how the new nation should be developed.</p><p>Here too he created the first American military award, the Order of the Purple Heart. This has attracted considerable interest, even though only three of the decorations are known to have been given out in Washington's time. The order was not revived until 1932, and it was subsequently awarded to all those wounded in action. (Posthumous award to those killed in action is automatic.)</p><p>Construction of the Hasbrouck House was started in 1725. The northeast portion was erected by Jonathan Hasbrouck in 1750, the year after his mother bought the property. Jonathan became a prosperous farmer-merchant and served during the first years of the Revolution as militia colonel. Forced by bad health to resign his commission in 1778, he died two years later. His widow reluctantly agreed to make the house available to Washington in 1782, and she lived temporarily with relatives on Huguenot Street in New Paltz. Having come to the house as a bride, she subsequently lived there until her death in the 1830s. In 1850 the state obtained possession and restored it to what is believed to have been its appearance in 1782.</p><p>A large central room has seven doors and a single window, the consequence of piecemeal enlargement of the house. Another curiosity of this room is a fireplace without jambs and with a chimney beginning at the level of the second floor. In the house's exceptionally large attic can be seen the maze of hand-hewn roof timbers.</p><p>The house and museum are open year-round for groups with reservations.

In a rearguard action on 30 October 1781, at a spot known variously by the names Butler's Ford, Jerseyfield, Poland, and West Canada Creek, Captain Walter Butler was left mortally wounded after a six-hour skirmish. Many myths are associated with the death of this remarkable Loyalist leader. What seems reasonably certain is that his scalp was taken to Albany and his body was left near where he died, probably to feed the wolves. The legend that he was secretly buried by Loyalists at Schenectady beneath abandoned St. Paul's Church is more than even the most gullible has ever taken seriously. His executor probably was an Oneida, perhaps the part-African "Colonel Louis." (See fort klock.)</p><h3><a id="WestPointMilitaryReservation"><b>West Point Military Reservation</b> </a></h3><p><b>West Point Military Reservation,</b> Hudson River, on N.Y. 218 off U.S. 9W. A relief map of the northeastern United States will make clear the strategic significance of the Lake Champlain, Mohawk River, Hudson River waterway. Somewhat less evident at first glance is that the major geographical barrier along this natural invasion route is formed by the Hudson Highlands, a mere 45 miles from the Atlantic. The narrow but deep estuary of the Hudson, navigable to oceangoing vessels for 150 miles (to Troy, 6 miles above Albany), winds between steep hills in the Highlands, and West Point is the ideal location for a fortress guarding the northern end of this 12-mile defile.</p><p>The first river fortification undertaken by the Patriots in the Highlands was on the island opposite West Point. Called Fort Constitution, it was never fully developed because in 1776 the decision was made to build Forts Clinton and Montgomery, about 10 miles down the river around Bear Mountain. But recent archaeology has discovered interesting remains of Revolutionary War works, and there are ruins of half a dozen or so little forts and redoubts on what is now called Constitution Island (then Martelaers Rock). The Warner House, built after 1836 on remnants of a stone cottage of colonial days, has been restored and preserved.</p><p>In the spring of 1778 the Patriots started making West Point into what Washington would later call "the key to America." Work was begun under the direction of General Israel Putnam and his cousin Rufus Putnam. Fort Putnam, the landmark that caps the rocky hill above the United States Military Academy today, was reconstructed in 1907, and extensive development of this picturesque site was started on the eve of the bicentennial. How much the Putnams had to do with designing the West Point fortifications is debatable, but European professionals soon took over. French-trained Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a Pole serving as a colonel of engineers in the Continental army, was in charge from March 1778 until June 1780. Much of the planning was done by Colonel Louis de La Radiere.</p><p>Today's visitor to West Point will see many vestiges of the old fortifications. Accessible by trails in the rocky hills are four redoubts and a gun battery to the west and south of Fort Putnam. On lower hills are Redoubts Wyllis and Meigs. Trophy Point, on the north edge of the Plain, has cannon captured during the Revolution and several links of the 180-ton chain that stretched across the Hudson here. Forged at the Sterling Iron Works in the Ramapo Valley, the links are 2 feet, 9 inches long. (The chain was held up by log rafts.)</p><p>Kosciuszko's Monument is on the parapet of Fort Clinton, near the northeast corner of the Plain. Designed by a West Pointer, it was erected by the corps of cadets in 1828. (The Polish hero died in 1817, having remained in America until 1798. He spent the rest of his life striving, unsuccessfully, for the revival of Poland.) In 1913 the statue was added to the monument by the Polish Clergy and Laity of the United States.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/washington-monument">Washington Monument</a>, just east of Trophy Point, is a replica of the statue in New York City's Union Square.</p><p>The West Point Cemetery, off Washington Road and less than half a mile west of the Plain, contains the grave of "Captain Molly" in a prominent spot near the front of the Old Cadet Chapel. This heroine in the defense of Fort Washington (under new york city see fort tryon park) died in 1800 and was reinterred here in 1926. Inside the chapel (built in 1837 near the site of the present library, and reconstructed here in 1911) are black marble shields inscribed in gold letters with the name, rank, and dates of birth and death of senior American generals in the Revolution. One shield, high in the southeast corner, has all of the inscription chiseled out except "Major General" and "1741."</p><p>Major General Benedict Arnold, born in 1741, was one of the best troop leaders this country ever produced. Although General Washington fought to see that Arnold got the recognition he deserved for combat service, the Continental Congress had a way of leaving him off promotion lists. Arnold also was plagued by financial difficulties, and for these and other reasons he finally made up his mind to seek his military fortune on the British side. (See also mount pleasant, under philadelphia, Pennsylvania.) Arnold and the British agreed on a general plan of action. The Rebel general would arrange with his own authorities to get command of a large American force. He would then arrange with the British authorities to surrender this force, and the British would pay him for his services.</p><p>Command of the Hudson Highlands impressed Arnold as being the ideal assignment, and in August 1780 he got it. For the preceding fifteen months he had been dealing through intermediaries with Major John André, the talented young aide to the British commander in chief. Now the time had come for a personal meeting to settle final details.</p><p>André came up the river on the armed sloop <i>Vulture</i> and had a clandestine meeting with Arnold in the woods south of Stony Point. Before he could return to the sloop it was driven off by two cannon that the enterprising Colonel James Livingston moved into position below Peekskill. Arnold then arranged for André to be guided through the American lines on the east side of the Hudson, and the British officer was captured at Tarrytown.</p><p>Arnold was having breakfast at the Robinson House and expecting a visit from Washington when he learned that André had been seized with incriminating documents in his possession. Arnold gave his young wife Peggy the news, hurried to his barge on the pretext of rushing to West Point on urgent business, and headed down the river to the <i>Vulture</i>. Peggy had been intimately involved in her husband's negotiations with the British from the start, but she put on such a great act that the Patriots never suspected her complicity.</p><p>Not until about six hours after Arnold's departure did Washington and his officers learn the essential facts. They then moved hurriedly to reorganize the defenses of the Highlands that Arnold had so carefully weakened and to make sure that reliable officers were in key spots. But these precautions turned out to be needless: none of Arnold's subordinates had been involved in the plot, and no British expedition was en route to attack the Highlands. André was imprisoned, tried, convicted, and hanged as a spy at Tappan (see tappan historic district). In 1821 his remains were moved to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-physical-geography/westminster">Westminster Abbey</a>. Reminders of his tragic story survive in many landmarks throughout the lower Hudson Valley.</p><p>Arnold's only monument, which refers to him as "the most brilliant soldier of the Continental Army" but does not mention his name, is the curious one at Saratoga (see saratoga national historic park). The British gave him pay, pensions, and a field command, but it was not enough for Arnold. After leading a number of destructive raids in Virginia and Connecticut, he went with Peggy and their children to London in December 1781. There he carried on an unsuccessful intrigue against General Sir Henry Clinton for an important military assignment in America. After the war he turned to commerce and died a broken and impoverished man in 1801. Peggy followed him to the grave only three years later. Their children were given British pensions, partly through the interest of Cornwallis, and gained considerable distinction in England. One son became a lieutenant general, and a grandson was a major general in <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-i">World War I</a>.</p><p>The West Point Military Reservation, the oldest United States military post over which the country's flag has flown continuously, is open to the public.

In a rocky ravine at the mouth of Wood Creek and at the southern tip of Lake Champlain, this place was called Skenesboro until after the Revolution. Although notoriously unhealthful, the site was perfect as a shipyard. Craft for American fleets on Lake Champlain were built here during the Revolution and the War of 1812, inspiring local boosters to call Whitehall the birthplace of the American navy. "Hardly a vestige of the Revolution is now left there," Benson Lossing found as long ago as 1848. But a detour off U.S. 4 to the grounds of the Skenesborough Museum (which has a model of the 1776 harbor) is recommended. On the grounds, under a long shed, is the giant hulk of the U.S.S. <i>Ticonderoga</i> (1814), and there is a picnic area alongside the lock of the Champlain Canal (which is active).

A major engagement fought here on 28 October 1776 was another defeat for the Patriots, but Sir William Howe again failed to follow through on his tactical victory and force the showdown that might have ended the Revolution here by annihilating Washington's little army. After their easy successes on Long Island and in Manhattan, British and German regulars had advanced slowly from Pell's Point (now Pelham Bay Park) to reach New Rochelle on 21 October. Colonel Rufus Putnam had made a remarkable ride of more than 50 miles in twenty-eight hours to gather information that indicated the British were headed for White Plains. Vital supplies for the Patriot army were at that place, and Washington therefore put his entire force in march from around Kings Bridge (now in the Bronx) to White Plains. The Americans were moving into the little village (strung out along what now is Broadway, Tibbetts Park being the remnant of the village green) as the enemy occupied New Rochelle and vicinity. General Howe waited a week before resuming his leisurely advance, and during this time the Patriots dug in.</p><p>Chatterton's Hill was not part of their position initially. Washington's forces were deployed from the Bronx River, across Purdy Hill (Church Street and Park Avenue), through the village, over Hatfield Hill to Merritt Hill (in West Harrison on Lake Street, overlooking Silver Lake).</p><p>Additional German reinforcements joined General Howe while his army prepared to resume its advance, and on 28 October he massed his thirteen thousand regulars in the open area between today's Mamaroneck Avenue and Rochambeau School on Fisher Avenue.</p><p>Chatterton's Hill had been recognized belatedly by Washington as a critical piece of terrain, and it was not until the morning of the battle that Continental regulars started moving to reinforce the Massachusetts militia already on the hill. Howe's military mind told him that this was the key to the battlefield, and here the only real fighting took place. British military historian <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/law-biographies/sir-john-fortescue">Sir John Fortescue</a> concludes that Howe lost the Battle of White Plains by failing to execute his planned attack on the main American position simultaneously with the assault on Chatterton's Hill.</p><p>In a ridiculous contest between German and British commanders to exhibit the superior courage and discipline of their own regiments, the brightly uniformed European regulars finally took the hill. Two Continental regiments particularly distinguished themselves in repelling the first two attacks and delaying the final assault. These were the Third New York and the Maryland regiments, under Colonels Rudolph Ritzema (who defected to the enemy about a year later) and William Smallwood. Other Continental units withdrew in good order after their right flank was exposed by the panic-stricken flight of the Massachusetts militia. The latter fled along what is now Battle Avenue pursued by dragoons, crossed the wooden bridge where Main Street now spans the Bronx River, and straggled north along the riverbank to Purdy Hill.</p><p>Here Washington had watched the battle. It is thought that he had his quarters during the period 23 to 28 October 1776 in the Jacob Purdy House on Spring Street before moving back to the Miller House (below). During the summer of 1778 Washington used the Jacob Purdy House for almost two months. Saved from urban renewal in the 1960s, this wooden farmhouse, built in 1721, has since been restored and made the center of a park. The house, which is owned by the White Plains Historical Society, is located at 60 Park Avenue in White Plains. Tours are by appointment; phone: (914) 428-1776.</p><p>Having had to deploy through the village initially to assure evacuation of supplies, Washington now improved his defenses by dropping back from Purdy Hill and Broadway to Miller Hill and Mount Misery (as his cold and hungry troops soon dubbed it). The original positions on Hatfield and Merritt Hills were maintained. When the British moved field guns up to shell Hatfield Hill and Miller Hill, they were driven back by American fire, and Howe made no further effort to find a weak spot. The British withdrew south to capture the bypassed strong-point of Fort Washington (see under new york city).</p><p>Most of the landmarks of this important but neglected battle have been preserved within the highly urbanized area of modern White Plains. Local organizations have collaborated in publishing an excellent guide, in establishing a Heritage Trail that links twenty-four sites, in saving and restoring houses and pieces of the battlefield, and in staging an annual reenactment of the battle.</p><p>The Elijah Miller House, on 140 Virginia Road in North White Plains at the foot of Miller Hill, is a story-and-a-half frame structure that Washington used for two weeks after he left the Purdy House (above). It is among the eighty-eight "Sites Also Noted" by the National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings. The old bake oven is still in working condition, and various housekeeping activities are demonstrated in the kitchen. A table and set of chairs used by Washington and his staff are on display in the council room. Owned by the county and maintained by the DAR, the Miller House is open to the public by appointment. Phone (914) 949-1236.</p><p>Miller Hill (the next numbered stop on the Heritage Trail) has restored earthworks, explanatory signs, and a panoramic view. Mount Misery (next stop) has restored earthworks. Merritt Hill, on Lake Street in West Harrison, overlooking Silver Lake, is a picturesque spot where several hundred men from patriotic colonial organizations reenact the battle each year on a Sunday near the 28 October anniversary date.</p><p>On Chatterton's Hill a monument marks the crest where Alexander Hamilton's battery of two guns supported the 1,600 Patriot defenders. A private residence on Whitney Avenue occupies the site, and the monument is a cannon of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/spanish-american-war">Spanish-American War</a>.</p><p>Other landmarks are along the 3.5-mile drive, which is marked with metal signs.</p><p>Contact the White Plains Historical Society (Jacob Purdy House), 60 Park Avenue, White Plains, N.Y. 10603. Phone: (914) 328-1776.</p><h3><a id="YoungsHouse"><b>Young's House</b> </a></h3><p><b>Young's House,</b> Four Corners, Westchester County, in Eastview on N.Y. 100C, in the triangle at the entrance to Grasslands Hospital. A memorial here marks the mass grave of soldiers from both sides killed nearby in a skirmish on the "Neutral Ground" on 3 February 1780. In violation of specific instructions not to remain long in any place with his patrol, a Patriot officer tarried in the vicinity of Mount Pleasant. The British sent out an expedition of crack troops, many of them mounted, and annihilated the American force in an action that lasted only a few minutes. The 450 Patriots lost 14 killed, 37 wounded, and 76 captured, their commander and 6 other officers being among the prisoners. The 550 attackers—British guards, Hessian infantry and jaegers, and Westchester Loyalists—had 5 killed and 18 wounded.</p></div><div class="bylinecontainer"> <span>Landmarks of the American Revolution: Library of Military History</span> <span></span></div><div class="modal fade" id="citationModal2" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><div class="modal-dialog modal-lg modal-dialog-scrollable"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button></div><div class="modal-body citation-container"><div class="TopicCitationDiv"><div class="TabbedPanels"><p class="citationprefix"> <a name="citationanchor"></a> <span class="citethis">Cite this article </span> <br> <span class="selectcitationtext">Pick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.</span></p><div role="tabpanel" class="TabbedPanels"><ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist"><li role="presentation"> <a href="#mlaTab2" class="active" aria-controls="malTab" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">MLA</a></li><li role="presentation"> <a href="#chicagoTab2" aria-controls="chicagoTab" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Chicago</a></li><li role="presentation"> <a href="#apaTab2" aria-controls="apaTab" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">APA</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content"><div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="mlaTab2"><p class="cittext"> "<a href="/defense/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/new-york

Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.</p><p> Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates. Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:</p><div><h4>Modern Language Association</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mla.org/style">http://www.mla.org/style</a></p><h4>The Chicago Manual of Style</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html</a></p><h4>American Psychological Association</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://apastyle.apa.org/">http://apastyle.apa.org/</a></p></div><h5>Notes:</h5><ul class="citationnotes"><li> Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers.

Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.</p><p> Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.

The director general of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-netherland">New Netherland</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/peter-stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>, and the dominie Johannes Megapolensis tried to refuse haven to the penniless and tired refugees. They protested to the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/benelux-history/dutch-west-india-company">Dutch West India Company</a> against the possible settlement of a "deceitful race" who professed an "abominable religion" and whose worship at the "feet of Mammon" would threaten and limit the profit of loyal subjects of the company. While Stuyvesant's plea was under consideration, other Jews including David de Ferrara and Abraham <a data-article="360225" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/de-lucena">de *Lucena</a> arrived in the spring of 1655. The population as a whole accepted the group. Instructions from the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/benelux-history/dutch-west-india-company">Dutch West India Company</a> followed letters written by the Jews to their coreligionists in the company, which directed that newcomers be permitted to live, trade, and travel in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-netherland">New Netherland</a>, and, in effect, to have the same privileges enjoyed in the Netherlands. Probably in deference to Stuyvesant, and because of the small size of the Jewish colony, the Jews, although permitted a burial ground, were not allowed to build a synagogue.</p><p>Despite the orders of the company, the newcomers faced other obstacles. The right to trade with some areas, including Albany, was denied as were rights to serve in the militia in lieu of paying a special tax, to own land, and to engage in retail trades like baking. These restrictions were all put forth by Stuyvesant. The Jews' response was twofold. The first took the form of a series of petitions drawn by Abraham de Lucena, Salvador d'Andrada, and Jacob Cohen Henriques addressed to the company in 1655 and 1656. The answers were affirmative. Burgher right, the right to conduct retail and wholesale trade in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a>, was extended to Jews in 1657, and the right to hold property was also upheld. Some Jews fought Stuyvesant on his own ground. <a data-article="360235" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/levy-asser">Asser *Levy</a> and <a data-article="360222" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/barsimson-jacob">Jacob *Barsimon</a> (who had arrived with Solomon Pietersen in August 1654, prior to the main body of settlers) began a successful court action in November 1655 to permit Jews to serve in the militia in lieu of the payment of a special derogatory tax. Thus the Jews gained primary <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/civil-rights">civil rights</a> within a few years of settlement.</p><p>Having secured a foothold, the first Jews began the task of sustaining themselves. While economic opportunity was quite limited compared with those in the more stable, secure, and richer markets of Europe and the Caribbean, the average Jew managed well. In 1655 Jewish taxpayers paid 8% of the cost of the Palisade or "Waal," later the site of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a>, while they made up only about 2% of the assessed population. Asser Levy became the most prominent and successful merchant. He built a prosperous real estate business, had a kosher butcher shop, and won the right to participate in the citizens' guard. Another member of the founding group, Levy, a butcher and tanner by trade, carried on his business just outside the city's wall. He expanded his interests to real estate and trade within the city, as well as in communities along the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/hudson-river">Hudson River</a>. Levy was one of the few pioneer Jews who remained and died in the province and whose descendants could be traced to 18<sup>th</sup>-century <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-york">New York</a>.</p><h3><a id="ENGLISH_COLONIAL_PERIOD">english colonial period</a></h3><p>The surrender of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> to the British in 1664 brought a number of changes to the Jewish settlement. Generally, civil and religious rights were widened. Jews were permitted to hold and be elected to public office and restrictions on the building of a synagogue were lifted. While there is some evidence that a synagogue existed as early as 1695, it was undoubtedly a private home used for this purpose by the Jewish community. Shearith Israel, the first congregation in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-york">New York</a>, was probably organized in about 1706. Between 1729 and 1730 the congregation erected the first synagogue, a small building on Mill Lane – known also as Mud Lane – the site of present South William Street. This event occurred some 75 years after the original settlement and was an indication of its permanence as well as of the acceptance by English authority of the Jewish economic and social position. Interestingly, the London and Curaçao communities, which were also founded in 1654, had built synagogues within a few years of their founding. The hesitancy of New York Jews was probably due to the smallness of their numbers, as well as to the transient nature of their status and to governmental opposition.</p><p>The roots of the colony depended upon its economic viability. Jewish merchants took a major interest in overseas trade, partly because ocean traffic negated somewhat onerous local control and requirements and partly because it provided a measure of freedom that allowed them to use their special skills. Movement from place to place was its own protection: investments were widespread and thus less vulnerable. The transient, wandering Jew was an answer to the ghetto and enclosing walls, for he was more difficult to tax and to ghettoize. He carried his wealth with him, and he had knowledge of languages – Hebrew, Yiddish, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch. In the correspondence of Nathan Simson, there are letters written in three and sometimes four languages. Simson had knowledge of the international market, and his kinsmen were in the Caribbean, Italy, Spain, the Near East, and India. This provided an opportunity not usually afforded the restricted Catholic or Protestant. Certain markets were specialties. When in 1699 Governor Bellomont wanted a bag of jewels that had been seized from an accused pirate appraised, he "ordered a Jew in town to be present, he understanding Jewells well."</p><p>Jews concentrated on such commodities as conditions required. They were among the first to introduce cocoa and chocolate to England and were heavily engaged in the coral, textile, and slave trades, and at times had virtual monopolies in the ginger trade. They are also said to have introduced whaleoil spermaceti candles to the colonies. In 1701 Jewish merchants accounted for 12% of those engaged in overseas trade, though they represented only about 2% of the general population. In 1776 they were less than 1% of the population and less than 1% of the overseas merchants. The decline of the overseas trade indicated not only that New York Jews had become rooted but also that they had found other means of earning a living. The colonial transience gave way to permanence.</p><p>During this process Jews struggled to obtain full citizenship, especially as it applied to trade. The Jew who wished to engage in overseas or wholesale trade had to face the question of his status, whether he was a citizen or an alien. As a citizen, except for some ambiguity with respect to his right to vote or hold office, he was allowed most rights including the right to trade. Since the English accepted Dutch citizenship equally with English, Jews who were burghers of New Amsterdam, as well as native-born colonists, continued to be citizens under British rule. The problems facing aliens, the status of the majority of Jews, were clearly set forth in the Trade and <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/navigation-acts">Navigation Acts</a> passed between 1650 and 1663. This central body of British law applying to the colonies was intended not only to foster mercantilism but also to prevent the encroachment upon trade by "Jews, French and other foreigners." Under these acts aliens could not engage in British commerce without severe penalty.</p><p>The necessity for some form of citizenship became obvious by the Rabba Couty affair. In November 1671 Couty's ship <i>Trial</i> was condemned by the Jamaica Vice-Admiralty Court on the ground that Couty, a Jew, was by definition a foreigner. In appealing the decision in England to the Council of Trade and Plantations, Couty obtained certificates from Governor Lovelace of New York indicating that he had been a free burgher of New York for several years. On this evidence and the fact that the ship and crew were English, the council held the sentence illegal. Those Jews, therefore, who could prove native birth did not need to bother with naturalization proceedings, but the alien Jew had to become a citizen if he was to engage in foreign trade. In general, however, the Jews in New York found that the procurement of naturalization, the right to trade and hold property, and the right of inheritance were not too difficult to obtain. Merchants in England were rarely naturalized; mostly they were endenizened – i.e., they could trade, but not hold real estate. In New York, on the other hand, 46 Jews were naturalized but only six endenizened. Freemanship, the right to engage in retail trade, was also relatively easy to obtain, despite instances of prohibition. Forty-seven Jews were made freemen between 1688 and 1770.</p><p>The decline of the overseas trade brought a corresponding increase in the numbers of Jews who were local retailers and craftsmen. They sold a wide range of goods, such as guns (especially during war), rum, wine, ironware, glass, furs, and foodstuff. Such merchants as Jacob Franks, <a data-article="360241" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/pacheco-rodrigo-benjamin-mendes">Rodrigo *Pacheco</a>, <a data-article="642842" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hays">Judah *Hays</a>, and <a data-article="403599" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/simson">Sampson *Simson</a> often advertised their wares in newspapers. They were frequently in partnership with non-Jews, including members of the Livingston, Cuyler, and Alexander families. In some instances such partnerships developed into long friendships, as was the case of Rodrigo Pacheco with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/james-alexander">James Alexander</a>. <a data-article="684170" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/myers-myer">Myer *Myers</a>, made freeman in 1746, became a noted silversmith and goldsmith whose work was much in demand and is displayed today in many museums. <a data-article="329267" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/etting">Benjamin *Etting</a>, also a goldsmith, was made a freeman in 1769; Michael Solomon <a data-article="642842" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hays">*Hays</a> in 1769 was a watchmaker; and Abraham Isaacs in 1770, a tailor. These occupations were not found in the period of initial settlement, and there were few Jews in the professions during this period. Dr. Elias Woolin was in the city in 1744, but there were no Jewish members of the bar, though Jews represented about 10% of the litigants in the various courts. In addition, some Jews were not successful financially. A number, including Isaac Levy, Moses Hart, and Michael Jacobs, became insolvent debtors. Some were jailed and others, like Aaron Machado and Abraham Myers Cohen, were written off as bad debts.</p><p>During the period of British control Jewish merchants were able to hold many positions of responsibility. <a data-article="391841" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/franks-jacob-0">Jacob *Franks</a> and his son David were provision agents for the Crown during the French and Indian War. Sampson Simson was a member of the group that received the charter for the Chamber of Commerce in 1770. Perhaps the highest position held by a Jew in colonial New York was that of colonial agent representing the colony's interests in Parliament. This post was given to Rodrigo Pacheco in 1731. Daniel and Mordecai Gomez served as Spanish interpreters to the Supreme Court in New York. A number of Jews were elected to office, generally as constables or assessors. Members of the Hays family made the constabulary something of a tradition. For Jewish citizens, Christian oaths necessary for office, voting, and naturalization were often modified or eliminated. It was quite unusual for Jews to hold office in the other colonies, and the fact that they did in New York was an indication of the cosmopolitan nature of the colony and its general acceptance of the Jewish community. There was no ghetto and little overt anti-Jewish feeling. Most of the Jewish population lived in the area below <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a>, generally in the Dock and South wards facing the East River, mixed among their Christian neighbors. Jacob Franks lived off Coenties Slip and Asser Levy on Stone Street, as did Jacob Acosta. The burial ground off present-day Chatham Square was also on the East Side, at the end of Pearl Street, the main road through that part of town. In 1748 the Swedish naturalist Peter Kalm, then residing in the colony, wrote that Jews "enjoyed all the privileges common to the other inhabitants of the town or the province."</p><p>Precise census figures are not generally available, but for most of the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries Jews represented 1% to 2% of the total New York City population. In 1700 there were 17 households listed in the assessment rolls; estimating this at six per family, there were about 100 individuals, or 2% of the general population of 4,500. In 1722, 20 households are named, or about 1½%. A peak of 31 families was recorded in 1728, about 2.3% of the general population of 8,000. This was followed by a gradual decline to 19 families in 1734, or 1.2%. In that year Jews paid 1.9% of the city's taxes; in 1722 they had paid 2%. As a group they were seemingly slightly more affluent than their neighbors. After 1734 there are no extant assessment lists for New York City, so population figures are questionable, but it is fairly safe to rely on the 1% figure for the remaining period, although it may have been more.</p><p>Congregation Shearith Israel provided a cohesive force. Not the least of its functions was to provide a secular education, for there were no public schools. Religious subjects, as well as arithmetic and English, were taught by itinerant teachers. Moses Fonseca, for example, was brought in from Curaçao to be a <i>ḥazzan</i> as well as teacher. There were strong pressures for intermarriage. The limited number of Jews and hostility between Sephardim and Ashkenazim, plus a basic tolerance, created an atmosphere conducive for intermarriage. In 1742 Phila Franks, daughter of Jacob and Abigail Franks, one of the most noted Jewish families, married Oliver Delancey, an aristocrat and an Episcopalian. A few months later her brother David married Margaret Evans of Philadelphia; their children were baptized. By the eve of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/american-revolution">American Revolution</a> the pioneer Jewish citizens – the Pinheiros, De Mesquitas, Asser Levys, and their descendants – had all but disappeared from the New York scene.</p><h3><a id="REVOLUTIONARY_PERIOD">revolutionary period</a></h3><p>The advent of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/american-revolution">American Revolution</a> found the Jewish community divided. In the past Jews had expressed their fealty to the Crown by word and deed. Numbers of Jews served in the colonial wars. Samuel Myers Cohen, Jacob Franks, and others were in the militia during the King George War, Abraham Solomon died in service during the French and Indian War, and others had served aboard privateers. Some, like members of the Franks family, were commissary agents for the British government. New York Jews, however, along with many others, sensed the emancipatory action of the Revolution and the possibility of full civil and political rights. Between 1768 and 1770 some 11 Jewish merchants, including <a data-article="398139" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/judah-samuel-benjamin-helbert">Samuel *Judah</a>, <a data-article="360236" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/levy-hayman">Hayman *Levy</a>, and <a data-article="391399" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/levy-jonas-phillips">Jonas *Phillips</a>, signed Non-Importation Articles that sought repeal of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/townshend-acts">Townshend Acts</a>, which placed duties on the importation of tea, paper, lead and paint among other articles. The conquest of the city by the British in 1776 caused many Jews to flee to unoccupied places, such as Philadelphia and several locations in Connecticut. One supporter of the American cause was <a data-article="282255" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/solomon">Haym *Solomon</a>, who for a time was imprisoned by the British as a spy. <i>Ḥazzan</i> Gershom Mendes <a data-article="360244" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/seixas">*Seixas</a> fled to Philadelphia and helped found Congregation Mikveh Israel there. Others, confident of British justice, chose to stay, and the congregation carried on services during the occupation. Among the Loyalists was Abraham Wagg, who left for England in 1779 and attempted reconciliation between the contending factions. Uriah <a data-article="356732" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hendricks">*Hendricks</a>, a noted merchant, remained loyal. David Franks was accused by Congress of being a Loyalist and relieved of his commissary rights with the American government. He held a similar post under the British. He also left for England, but returned after the war for a time. The majority of Jews preferred a neutral position in the conflict, partly in fear of the consequences of a wrong guess. Jews sympathetic with the British cause knew what to expect from England but did not know what their status would be under the new government. Patriotic Jews, on the other hand, looked forward to a new freedom.</p><h3><a id="EARLY_AMERICAN_PERIOD">early american period</a></h3><p>The end of the Revolution brought many distinct changes. Civil liberties, often a matter of governmental whim under the English, became part of the New York State constitution. Opportunities were expanded and new fields opened. Within a decade after the Revolution, Judah Zuntz and <a data-article="403599" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/simson">Solomon *Simson</a> were admitted to the bar. In 1792 <a data-article="360244" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/seixas">Benjamin *Seixas</a> and <a data-article="827662" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hart-ephraim">Ephraim *Hart</a> were among the founders of the New York Stock Exchange. Gershom Mendes Seixas served as a trustee of Columbia College from 1784 to 1814, and was one of 14 ministers who participated at <a data-article="658912" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/washington-georgedeg">George *Washington</a>'s first inaugural in April 1789, and Col. David M. Franks was one of the marshals in charge of the processional at the inaugural. Among the first Jewish graduates of Columbia College was Sampson Simson in 1800. Walter Judah, admitted to the college in 1795, also attended the medical school. He died while treating the sick during the <a class="interlinked" href="/medicine/diseases-and-conditions/pathology/yellow-fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic of 1798. In 1818 Governor <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/de-witt-clinton">De Witt Clinton</a> attended the opening of Shearith Israel when the congregation rebuilt the synagogue on the Mill Street site. No colonial governor is known to have ever shown such deference to the community.</p><p>The Revolution reduced the Jewish population to less than 1% of the population. It remained at that level until the 1830s and 1840s, when an influx of German and Polish Jews caused a sudden rise to perhaps 15,000 in 1847 and to some 40,000, or approximately 4%, on the eve of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a>. Replacing the old and for the most part extinct pioneer generation were mostly German Jews, such as Harmon <a data-article="356732" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hendricks">*Hendricks</a>, son of Uriah, a mid-18<sup>th</sup>-century immigrant, who established possibly the first copper-rolling mill in the country in 1813. One of the distinctive changes in postwar New York was Jewish involvement in the political life of the community, perhaps best seen in the career of <a data-article="360240" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/noah-mordecai-manuel">Mordecai Manuel *Noah</a>. Born in Philadelphia in 1785, he entered public service as consul to Tunis in 1813. He became a member of the Democratic Party and was elected high sheriff of New York in 1821, surveyor of the port from 1829 to 1833, and judge of the Court of Sessions in 1841. In 1825 he started the unsuccessful Jewish settlement of Ararat on the Niagara River. As editor of the newspaper <i>The Evening Star</i> during the 1830s, he broke with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/andrew-jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> and became a founder of the Whig and Nativist parties. His espousal of Jewish causes and his involvement with politics reflected a distinct example of the interests of the community. His funeral in 1851 was attended with the most elaborate ceremony by the Jewish settlement. The publishers <a data-article="353318" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/phillips">Naphtali *Phillips</a> and <a data-article="650793" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/judah-1">Naphtali *Judah</a> were powers in the Tammany Society in the first two decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. <a data-article="360238" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/myers-mordecai">Mordecai *Myers</a> was elected to the state assembly in 1829 and 1831, while <a data-article="393726" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hart-emanuel-bernard">Emanuel B. *Hart</a> was elected to the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/house-representatives">House of Representatives</a> in 1851. He also held the posts of surveyor of the port and president of the Board of Aldermen. Greater social mobility of the Jews after the Revolution could be seen in their movement uptown from the area below Wall Street into other parts of the city. <a data-article="859950" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/isaacs">Sampson *Isaacs</a> and Naphtali and Benjamin Judah lived in the Third Ward, the present-day <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/greenwich-village">Greenwich Village</a>. The residences of Jacob B. <a data-article="360244" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/seixas">*Seixas</a> and Asher Marx were located on the newly burgeoning East Side. The lower midtown area was the residence of Henry Hyman, <a data-article="678269" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/moses-isaac-s">Isaac *Moses</a>, and Hayman <a data-article="360244" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/seixas">*Seixas</a>. The wealthiest Jews and non-Jews resided a little below and a little above Wall Street. Harmon Hendricks, probably the richest Jew of early 19<sup>th</sup>-century New York, lived at 61 Greenwich Street. Near him, on this "quality lane," resided the almost equally wealthy <a data-article="437130" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/isaacs-jacob">Solomon J. *Isaacs</a>, Lewis Marks, and Mrs. Isaac Moses.</p><p>The changing character of the community was also evident in the changing religious organization. In 1825 a group of Ashkenazi Jews, led by Barrow E. Cohen and <a data-article="360233" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/kursheedt-israel-baer">Isaac B. *Kursheedt</a>, complaining of its formality and control, broke away from the parent body, Shearith Israel, and formed the Bnai Jeshurun Congregation. In 1828 another dissenting group of Dutch, German, and Polish Jews broke from Bnai Jeshurun and formed the Congregation Anshe Chesed. In 1839, Polish members of these two groups formed Congregation Shaarey Zedek. Other German Jews formed Shaarey Hashamayim in 1839, Rodeph Shalom in 1842, and Temple Emanu-El in 1845. Dutch Jews established Bnai Israel in 1847 and French, Shaarey Brocho in 1851. The proliferation of congregational organizations and divisions of the Jewish community were due partly to the new freedom resulting from the Revolution. At first, these new congregations used a number of privately owned buildings before erecting their own synagogue buildings in what became a period of synagogue construction. The old Mill Street synagogue was sold by Shearith Israel in 1833 and a new building was erected on Crosby Street. In addition, there were five major synagogue structures in New York by 1860: Bnai Jeshurun on Greene Street, Shaarey Tefilah on Wooster, Anshe Chesed on Norfolk Street, Temple Beth El on 33<sup>rd</sup> Street, and Rodeph Shalom on Clinton Street. In the 1850s Anshe Chesed was the largest congregation in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/united-states">United States</a>. By the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a>, Temple Emanu-El and Shearith Israel were the wealthiest and most influential of the congregations.</p><p>Religious organizations produced a number of distinguished leaders. <a data-article="859950" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/isaacs">Samuel M. *Isaacs</a>, an English Jew who arrived in New York in 1839, was <i>ḥazzan</i> and possibly the first regular preacher in New York City. He was engaged as <i>ḥazzan</i> by Bnai Jeshurun and Shaarey Tefilah. From 1859 he edited the <i>Jewish Messenger</i>, one of the most influential Jewish periodicals. <a data-article="403596" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lyons-jacques-judah">Jacques Judah *Lyons</a>, the <i>ḥazzan</i> of Shearith Israel in the 1840s, compiled material for a proposed history of Jews in America, a task he did not complete. The first ordained rabbis arrived in the 1840s from Europe. Among them was Leo Merzbacher who ministered to Anshe Chesed and Rodeph Shalom and helped in establishing the Reform Temple Emanu-El, where he delivered sermons, attended official functions, and assisted in the education of the children. Others included <a data-article="905776" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lilienthal-max">Dr. Max *Lilienthal</a>, considered the most capable preacher in German, and <a data-article="648039" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/raphall-morris-jacob">Dr. Morris J. *Raphall</a>, who had a distinguished career with generally German congregations. <i>Ḥazzanim</i> with excellent singing voices who enhanced the synagogue services included Leon Sternberger of Warsaw and Ignatius Ritterman of Cracow.</p><p>The period after the Revolutionary War also saw the start of mutual-aid societies and <i>landsmanshaften</i>, which generally began as burial societies (<i>ḥevra kaddisha</i>). The Hebrah Gemilut Hasadim, organized at Shearith Israel in 1786, disbanded in 1790. As a successor, Rabbi Gershom Mendes Seixas founded Hebrah Hesed Vaemet in 1802, an organization still in existence. In 1826 Bnai Jeshurun formed the Hebrah Gemilut Hesed, known as the Hebrew Mutual Benefit Society, the forerunner of many such societies. The first president of this important group was Isaac B. Kursheedt. Anshe Chesed helped organize several societies, including the Montefiore Society in 1841.</p><p>Numerous <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/social-organizations/private-organizations/fraternal-orders">fraternal orders</a> began, the most important being the Independent Order <a data-article="297387" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bnai-brith">*B'nai B'rith</a>, founded in 1843 by 12 men, including Henry Jones, Isaac Rosenberg, and R.M. Roadacher. It combined mutual aid and fraternal features in an effort to bring harmony and peace among Jews. The groups spread rapidly with lodges and memberships throughout the country. Another such society was the Hebrew Benevolent Society, established in 1822 with Daniel Jackson as its first president. He was succeeded by John I. Hart and Roland M. Mitchell. (These names are an indication of the difficulty of identifying Jews during this period.) In 1820 women of Shearith Israel had organized a Female Hebrew Benevolent Society. In 1844 the German Hebrew Benevolent Society, a more narrowly based <i>Landsleute</i> group, was formed. These groups worked so well that by the eve of the Civil War few, if any, Jews had to apply to city institutions for aid. The Hebrew Benevolent Society and German Hebrew Benevolent Society united just prior to the Civil War, but other groups continued to maintain independence. Under the urging of Rev. Samuel Isaacs in the <i>Jewish Messenger</i> and <a data-article="678282" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/adler-samuel">Dr. Samuel *Adler</a> of Temple Emanu-El, the Hebrew and German societies formed the Hebrew Orphan Asylum in 1859.</p><p>For years after the Revolution there were demands for a Jewish hospital. It was not until 1852, however, that Sampson Simson, with the assistance of Shearith Israel and Shaarey Tefilah and a group of native and English Jews, founded "Jews' Hospital in the City of New York." This became known as <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/judaism/judaism/mount-sinai">Mount Sinai</a> in 1866. Contributions from <a data-article="393733" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/touro-judah">Judah *Touro</a> of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> and N.K. Rosenfeld of Temple Emanu-El, among others, helped in the construction of the building in 1853. Poor patients were given free treatment. The staff, as well as patients, were Jewish and non-Jewish.</p><p>Young men's Jewish groups also became part of the social scene of 19<sup>th</sup>-century New York and reflected a universal interest in education and its dissemination, so much a part of Jacksonian America. In 1852 a Hebrew Young Men's Literary Society was founded. A splinter group formed the Philodocean Society, and in 1854 another group formed the Touro Literary Institute. Other groups included the Montefiore Literary Association and the Washington Social Club. In 1858 the Young Men's and Touro groups merged to form the Hebrew Young Men's Literary Society. Jews also organized military organizations that had strong social overtones. These included Troop K, Empire Hussars, and the Young Men's Lafayette Association. Most of these social organizations, which included the Cultur Verein and Sange Verein, were formed as <i>landsmanshaften</i>, i.e., Young Men of Germany, Polish Young Men, etc. The Harmonie Club of German Jews is still in existence. Various members of these socially and culturally conscious organizations joined B'nai Brith before the Civil War and in 1850 also founded the Maimonides Library Association. This was a large library, housed on Orchard Street, and it was open to the public. Elaborate balls, dinners, and charity concerts did much to enliven New York Jewish society. The annual ball of the Young Men's Hebrew Benevolent Society was first held in 1842, and the annual dinners of the Hebrew and German Hebrew Benevolent Societies were highlights of the social season.</p><p>The flourishing of New York Jewish society found expression in the rise not only of community organizations but also of the press. The late 18<sup>th</sup>-century bookseller and publisher Benjamin Gomez was joined in his profession by Naphtali Phillips, publisher of the <i>National Advocate</i>, and Solomon Jackson, publisher of the first Jewish periodical in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/united-states">United States</a>, a monthly entitled <i>The Jew</i> (issued from 1823 to 1825). The first successful Jewish periodical was Robert Lyon's <i>The Asmonean</i> (1848–58), which published the debates between Jewish leaders over the necessity of a union of American Jews. In 1857 Rabbi Samuel Isaacs' <i>Jewish Messenger</i> became the voice of Orthodox Judaism and called for a union of Jewish charities, while championing a Jewish free school. There were printers skilled in German type, including Henry Franks, who printed a holiday prayer book, <i>Maḥzor mi-Kol ha-Shanah</i>, among other items. Isaac Bondi, rabbi of Anshe Chesed, edited the <i>Hebrew Leader</i> from 1859 to 1874. Among the works of Jewish authors published during this period were Mordecai Noah's imaginative <i>Book of Yashar</i> and Rev. Raphall's <i>Post-Biblical History of the Jews</i>. Despite an interest in literature and the arts, few scholarly works were produced by Jews during this time. Highly skilled Jewish artisans in the tradition of Myer Myers were few, an exception being <a data-article="650502" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jacobs-lazarus">Jacob R. *Lazarus</a>, a painter and student of Henry Inman, whose works are today in the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/metropolitan-museum-art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.</p><p>Jewish education varied little from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, except that free public schools, which were Protestant in tone, were available from 1805. These schools were extensively used by the Jewish population, especially after they came under governmental control in 1842, slowly gave up sectarianism, and greatly expanded, thus lessening the demand for synagogal day schools. In 1842 Rabbi Samuel Isaacs of Bnai Jeshurun converted an afternoon school to the New York Talmud Torah and Hebrew Institute. It lasted until 1847. Other congregations such as Anshe Chesed and Rodeph Shalom also started short-lived Hebrew and English schools. Jews generally objected to the teaching of Christian ethics and the use of Christian textbooks in public schools. Such objections helped trigger the expansion of Hebrew schools in the 1850s. Bnai Jeshurun, Temple Emanu-El, Shaarey Zedek, and Shearith Israel all started parochial day schools combining secular and religious education. By 1854 there were seven such schools but there was great debate over their necessity. As in the colonial period, the education of Jewish girls was not considered too important; they were either sent to public schools or taught by private tutors. A few unsuccessful attempts were made to establish institutions of higher education. Sampson Simson organized the Jewish Theological Seminary and Scientific Institution, but there was little else. Jews of New York did not support Isaac Wise's Zion Collegiate Institute in Cincinnati and little was done for Samuel M. Isaacs' Hebrew high school founded in the 1850s.</p><p>Several world events stirred the community. The <a data-article="649608" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/mortara-case-0">*Mortara</a> case in Italy in 1859, in which a Jewish boy was converted to Christianity despite family objections, led S.M. Isaacs to form the <a data-article="355887" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/board-delegates-american-israelites">*Board of Delegates of the American Israelites</a>; it was intended to protect and secure civil and religious rights of Jews in the U.S. and abroad. An earlier episode, the <a data-article="299876" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/damascus-affair">*Damascus Affair</a> (an accusation of ritual murder against the Jews of Damascus), led to several mass meetings in 1840 calling for President Van Buren to protest this accusation.</p><p>There was tremendous diversity to Jewish business interests during this period. Generally, however, the latter centered on small retail shops and small handicraft businesses. Some Jews held posts in <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts/civil">civil service</a>, generally of a minor nature, an exception being Albert <a data-article="728277" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/cardozo">*Cardozo</a>, justice of the Supreme Court of New York. There were a few men of prominence in business. <a data-article="360236" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/levy-hayman">Hayman *Levy</a>, one of the largest fur traders in the colonies, employed John Jacob Astor in his business after the Revolution. Another was Eli Hart, who was in the wheat and flour business. Daniel Jackson was a noted broker and banker.<a data-article="393725" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hart-bernard">Bernhard *Hart</a> was honorary secretary of the New York Stock Exchange from 1831 to 1853. <a data-article="649721" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/belmont-august">August *Belmont</a> represented Rothschild interests in New York after he replaced Joseph L. and J. Josephs in 1836.</p><h3><a id="CIVIL_WAR">civil war</a></h3><p>The Civil War found the Jewish community, like the rest of the country, divided over slavery. New York City in many ways resembled a Southern city. Though slavery was prohibited after 1827, schools and theaters were segregated. Many Jews, including members of the Manumission Society of New York City, had freed their slaves, others retained them until forced to set them free. Mordecai M. Noah supported the pro-slavery position, as did Dr. Morris J. Raphall, who observed that the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/bible/bible-general/ten-commandments">Ten Commandments</a> condoned slavery. This position was attacked by Michael <a data-article="832589" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/heilprin">*Heilprin</a>, writing in the <i>Tribune</i>, and he was joined by Rev. Samuel M. Isaacs as well as many others. With the start of the war the Jewish response was overwhelmingly in favor of the Union. On April 20, 1861, <a data-article="678971" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hahn-nordlingen-joseph-yuspa-ben-phinehas">Joseph *Seligman</a> was vice president of a Union meeting held at Union Square. His firm, J. and J. Seligman &amp; Co., sold federal bonds in the astonishing sum of $200,000,000. Although Jews enlisted quickly, there was strong anti-Jewish bias in the army. At first Jewish chaplains were not permitted to serve, but Samuel M. Isaacs and his son Myer were among the leaders of the successful struggle to change the restrictive terms of the law. Jewish soldiers were dispersed throughout the army, and there were few Jewish enclaves, except for Company D of the 8<sup>th</sup>, New York, <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/national-guard">National Guard</a>.</p><p>Jews also supported the war effort by aiding the United States Sanitary Commission, and held numerous Purim balls or Feasts of Esther to help the sick and wounded. Shearith Israel, Anshe Chesed, and Temple Emanu-El were in the forefront of the effort to raise money for the war effort. The 1864 Sanitary Fair in New York, the largest held during the war, found Benjamin Nathan and Moses Lazarus on the executive committee and Moses Schloss and Lewis May on the general committee. The Jews Hospital opened its wards to the wounded and between 1862 and 1865 treated hundreds of soldiers of all faiths. Judge Albert Cardozo and Col. E.B. Hart were on the Advisory Committee of the New York State Soldiers Committee. By the end of the war the Jewish community was numerous, well-represented, and established. It had prepared the ground for future, more massive immigration. Newcomers after 1865 found a community with a history and a background of accomplishment that proved receptive to them.</p><p>[Leo Hershkowitz]</p><h2><a id="_1870-1920">1870–1920</a></h2><h3><a id="MIGRATION_AND_POPULATION_GROWTH">migration and population growth</a></h3><p>Beginning in the 1870s and continuing for half a century, the great migration from <a class="interlinked" href="/history/historians-and-chronicles/historians-european/eastern-europe">Eastern Europe</a> radically altered the demography, social structure, cultural life, and communal order of New York Jewry. During this period more than a million Jews settled in the city. They were overwhelmingly Yiddish-speaking and impoverished, the products of intensive, insular Jewish life and wretched economic conditions. Meeting the harsh problems of economic survival, social integration, and the maintenance of the ethnic heritage required vast physical, emotional, and intellectual efforts.</p><p>On their arrival in the city the East European Jews (commonly called Russian Jews) found a Jewish settlement dominated by a group strikingly different in cultural background, social standing, and communal outlook. By the 1870s this older settlement had become, with some important exceptions, middle class in outlook, mercantile in its economic base, and Reform Jewish in group identity. Successfully integrated in the economic life of the city and well advanced in its acculturation to the larger society, the established community drew its leadership from a socially homogenous elite of bankers, merchant princes, brokers, and manufacturers. The two groups – the prosperous and Americanized "uptown Jews" and the alien and plebeian "downtown Jews" – confronted and interacted with each other, a process that significantly shaped the course of community development.</p><p>Two-thirds of the city's Jews in 1870 were German born or children of German-born parents. Together with the smaller subgroups – descendants of the 18<sup>th</sup>-century community, clusters of English, Dutch, and Bohemian Jews, and a growing contingent of Polish Jews (who formed a distinctive subcommunity) – the Jewish population numbered 60,000, or 4% of the inhabitants of the larger city (Manhattan and Brooklyn). By 1920, New York (all five boroughs) contained approximately 1,640,000 Jews (29% of the total population), and they made up the largest ethnic group in the city. (The Italians, the second most numerous, formed 14% of the population. Their arrival in the city paralleled the Russian Jewish migration, and their initial areas of settlement adjoined the Jewish immigrant quarters.) By 1920, 45% of the Jewish population of the United States lived in New York.</p><p>As the main port of entry for immigrants, New York served as a transit point and temporary domicile. The city also attracted a portion of those who entered the country through other ports, particularly Philadelphia and Baltimore, or who came to the city after having lived inland for a time. Of all immigrant groups, Jews ranked first in their preference for New York. According to S. Joseph, 1,372,189 Jews passed through the port of New York between 1881 and 1911, of whom 73% settled in the city. The Table: Population Growth-nyc and Jews indicates the population growth of New York and of its Jewish community. (The statistical data for New York City and Brooklyn are combined for the period prior to 1898 to permit comparison with the later period. New York City in 1870 was restricted to Manhattan Island. In 1874 it annexed three western townships in the Bronx and in 1895 annexed the eastern towns. Brooklyn remained a separate city until 1898 when it consolidated with Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and Richmond (Staten Island) to form the present-day city. Before 1900 only scattered Jews lived in the areas that later became the boroughs of Queens and Richmond.)</p><table><thead><tr><td><b>Year</b></td><td><b>Total Population of Greater New York</b></td><td><b>Estimated Jewish Population</b></td><td><b>Percentage of Jews to Total Population</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1870</td><td>1,363,213</td><td>60,000</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>1880</td><td>1,912,698</td><td>80,000</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>1890</td><td>2,507,414</td><td>225,000</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>1900</td><td>3,437,202</td><td>580,000</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>1910</td><td>4,766,883</td><td>1,100,000</td><td>23%</td></tr><tr><td>1920</td><td>5,620,048</td><td>1,643,000</td><td>29%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Population dispersion within the city accompanied this growth (See Table: New York - Population Growth). In 1870 nearly two-thirds of the inhabitants of Greater New York resided in Manhattan. Fifty years later Manhattan's population had grown two and a half times, but it contained only two-fifths of the city's inhabitants. During this period Brooklyn's population multiplied fourfold, the Bronx's fifteenfold, Queens' ninefold, and Richmond's threefold. Queens and Richmond, still the most thinly inhabited areas of the city, had a density per acre of 6.1 and 3.2 persons, respectively, compared with 27.6 for the Bronx, 39.5 for Brooklyn, and 160 for Manhattan. On Manhattan's Lower East Side – bounded by Catherine Street, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/bowery">the Bowery</a>, Third Avenue, 14<sup>th</sup> Street, and the East River – the population numbered 415,000 in 1920, a decline from a peak of 540,000 in 1910. At the height of its congestion, one-fourth of Manhattan's residents occupied one-twentieth of the island's space, an area of 1.5 sq. mi. For most of 50 years these East Side blocks, already overcrowded in 1870, were the reception center for the flood of Russian Jewish immigration. Only after 1900, when the immigrants themselves established new neighborhoods in areas like Harlem and Brownsville in Brooklyn, did some newcomers go directly there, bypassing the Lower East Side.</p><table><thead><tr><td /><td><b>1880</b></td><td><b>1910</b></td><td><b>1920</b></td><td><b>Jewish Population 1920 (est.)</b></td><td><b>Percentage of Jews to Pop. 1920</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Manhattan</td><td>1,164,673</td><td>2,331,542</td><td>2,284,103</td><td>657,101</td><td>28.8</td></tr><tr><td>The Bronx</td><td>51,980</td><td>430,980</td><td>732,016</td><td>278,169</td><td>38.0</td></tr><tr><td>Brooklyn</td><td>599,495</td><td>1,643,351</td><td>2,018,356</td><td>604,380</td><td>29.9</td></tr><tr><td>Queens</td><td>56,559</td><td>284,041</td><td>469,042</td><td>86,194</td><td>18.4</td></tr><tr><td>Richmond</td><td>38,991</td><td>85,969</td><td>116,531</td><td>17,168</td><td>14.7</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,912,698</td><td>4,766,883</td><td>5,620,048</td><td>1,643,012</td><td>29.2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Jews constituted the most conspicuous element in this dual phenomenon of rising congestion and rapid dispersion. In 1870 the less affluent, and those whose occupations required it, lived in the southern wards of the Lower East Side along the axis of East Broadway. Germans, Irish, and native Americans constituted a majority of the district's population.</p><p>The northern tier of wards, stretching from Rivington to 14<sup>th</sup> streets, were heavily populated by Germans. Two-story frame houses were the prevailing type of residence, though many of these had already been converted to multiple-family use. By 1890, with Russian Jews pouring in, the great majority of the earlier inhabitants, including the German Jews, left the 80 square blocks of the southern wards. Ten years later they were in the process of abandoning the entire region below 14<sup>th</sup> Street to the rising tide of Jewish immigrants. The characteristic type of residency in the enlarged Jewish quarter was now the double-decker or "dumbbell" tenement. (The dumbbell shape met an 1879 municipal regulation requiring an air-shaft between contiguously built tenements.) These tenements were five to eight stories in height, they occupied 75 to 90% of a plot 25 feet wide and 100 feet deep, and each floor contained four apartments – a total of 14 rooms, of which only one in each apartment received air and light from the street or from a cramped backyard. The most congested area was the tenth ward, the heart of the Jewish East Side. In the 46 blocks between Division, Clinton, Rivington, and Chrystie Streets that made up the ward (an area of 106 acres), there were 1,196 tenements in 1893. The population was 74,401, a density of 701.9 persons an acre.</p><p>The German Jews who left the Lower East Side in this population displacement joined their more prosperous brethren, who had moved halfway up the east side of Manhattan in the years following the Civil War. They settled between 50<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> Streets, a region that included the beginnings of Yorkville with its heavy concentration of Germans. Smaller contingents settled farther north in the upper-class neighborhood of Harlem, north of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/central-park">Central Park</a>, and scattered numbers reached the zone of well-situated brownstone homes west of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/central-park">Central Park</a>.</p><p>The relocation of synagogues and the establishment of other Jewish institutions underscored this process of removal and social differentiation: the geographical division, in short, of the Jewish populace into "uptown" and "downtown." As early as 1860 the venerable Shearith Israel moved from Crosby Street, in a rapidly declining downtown area, to 19<sup>th</sup> Street near Fifth Avenue. In 1897 it moved to Central Park West and 70<sup>th</sup> Street, its present site. (Shaarey Tefillah, the first congregation on the Upper West Side, erected its synagogue on West 82<sup>nd</sup> Street four years earlier.) Temple Emanu-El, the leading Reform congregation in the city, moved from East 12<sup>th</sup> Street to Fifth Avenue and 43<sup>rd</sup> Street, where the congregation in 1868 consecrated an impressive Moorish-style edifice. In 1872 Ahavath Chesed occupied its fourth site in its 26-year existence when it moved to Lexington Avenue and 55<sup>th</sup> Street (known as the Central Synagogue, this is the oldest building in continuous use as a synagogue in New York). A year later Anshe Chesed left downtown Norfolk Street for Lexington Avenue and 63<sup>rd</sup> Street. Soon after, it consolidated with Adas Jeshurun to form Temple Beth El, which in 1891 moved to Fifth Avenue and 76<sup>th</sup> Street. Though Bnai Jeshurun, the oldest Ashkenazi congregation in the city, eventually moved to the West Side, it, too, belonged to the mainstream migration to the mid-East Side. In 1865 it occupied a newly completed house of worship, its third, on 34<sup>th</sup> Street and Broadway. It migrated further uptown to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/madison-avenue">Madison Avenue</a> and 65<sup>th</sup> Street in 1884. In 1918 the congregation moved to its present synagogue on West 88<sup>th</sup> Street near West End Avenue.</p><p>Also located in the mid-East Side area were a number of private clubs that catered to the social needs of the wealthier Jewish businessmen: Criterion, Fidelio, Freundschaft, Lotus, Progress, and the prestigious Harmonie, the club of the German-Jewish elite. Harmonie occupied its own building on 42<sup>nd</sup> Street west of Fifth Avenue from 1867 to 1912, when it moved to 4 East 60<sup>th</sup> Street. In 1872 uptown Jews transferred one of their most esteemed philanthropic institutions, <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/judaism/judaism/mount-sinai">Mount Sinai</a> Hospital, to 67<sup>th</sup> Street and Lexington Avenue. By the turn of the century additional institutions supported by the older community were operating in the area. The Baron de Hirsch Trade School on East 64<sup>th</sup> Street, the Clara de Hirsch Home for Working Girls on East 63<sup>rd</sup> Street, and the Young Men's Hebrew Association (ymha) at Lexington and 92<sup>nd</sup> Street were the most prominent. Fourteen synagogues served the growing Yorkville settlement, half of them Reform or Conservative. They occupied spacious buildings – Beth El seated 2,400 and Emanu-El 1,600 – and congregants had average annual incomes that ranged from Bnai Jeshurun's $20,000 to Emanu-El's $46,000. The Orthodox congregations mainly served a Central European group, though affluent East European Jews were moving into the area and joining them. Zichron Ephraim, organized in 1889 and located on 67<sup>th</sup> Street near Lexington Avenue, was the wealthiest. Its rabbi was New York-born and had received his university and rabbinical training in Germany and the U.S.</p><p>The Jewish settlement in Harlem developed along broadly parallel lines, though with some differences. It grew more slowly at the start. Less accessible to the center of the city – hence beyond the reach of most middle-class families – Harlem became a residential suburb for the wealthy. In 1874, when Temple Israel was established, it was the sole congregation in Harlem. Fourteen years later, when it dedicated its new synagogue on Fifth Avenue and 125<sup>th</sup> Street, three other small congregations were serving the community as well. By 1900 the number of permanent synagogues had grown to 13. Significantly, four of these had been founded by East European Jews, a sign that the movement of Russian Jews from the Lower East Side to Harlem was already well under way.</p><p>The immigrant influx inspired the poet <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/emma-lazarus">Emma Lazarus</a> in 1883 to compose <i>The New Colossus</i>, a paean to the future Americans. The famous sonnet echoes many of the conflicting identities and ideals swirling around the new arrivals. The compassion of the lines "huddled masses yearning to breathe free" welcomes the tired immigrants, but the following image of the "wretched refuse of your teaming shore" hints at the condescension these refugees were to suffer. These tensions, between ancient and modern, Jew and American, freedom and oppression, give Lazarus' work meaning and power. The sonnet was engraved on a plaque and placed in the pedestal of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/statue-liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> in 1903, 16 years after her death.</p><p>The completion of the first elevated railway in the late 1870s inaugurated a new age of transit, opening cheap, semirural land to intensive urban development. Along a network of expanding elevated and subway routes, Russian Jewish immigrants moved out of the downtown quarter in two great streams: north to Harlem and then to the Bronx, and southeast across the East River to Brooklyn's Williamsburg and Brownsville. By the 1880s three elevated lines were running the length of Manhattan. In 1904 the first subway was completed. One route extended to the tip of Manhattan and opened the West Side and Washington Heights to mass settlement. A branch ran through Harlem and even before its completion brought a wave of construction to peripheral areas. The subway placed sections of the Bronx within the reach of families of modest means. In like manner the transit net spread to Brooklyn. The barrier of the East River was first breached in 1883 with the completion of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/brooklyn-bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>. The Williamsburg Bridge (1903) and the Manhattan Bridge (1909) and subway tunnels under the river vastly improved interborough transportation. A construction boom in multi-family dwellings marked the years 1904–07. In 1914 and 1915 twice as many apartment units were built in Brooklyn as in Manhattan, a ratio that held into the 1920s, when additional subway facilities were completed.</p><p>Though transportation and moderate rents were essential for geographic mobility, rising expectations and economic progress were no less significant. The physical conditions the new immigrant encountered were tolerable while he made his initial adjustment and saved to bring the family that was left behind. With this achieved, the Jewish immigrant family looked beyond the immigrant quarter. Improved housing and environmental conditions, particularly as they might affect the young, were the predominant motives in a family's calculations (new neighborhood housing was superior because of the more stringent municipal regulations under which it was built). For the working class, moreover, the Lower East Side was losing its "walk to work" advantage. By 1910 the main immigrant area of employment – the clothing industry – was moving to the West Side between 14<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> Streets (during the 1920s its center reached the Pennsylvania Station district). This development reflected the decreasing role of the sweatshop. Once the tenement-flat sweatshop, based as it was on cheap labor drawn from the neighborhood, was restricted or eliminated, a major feature that had attracted newly arrived Jewish immigrants to the Lower East Side disappeared. The gradual elimination of the sweatshop belonged to a general improvement in labor conditions beginning after 1900, when municipal housing regulations began having some effect over the worst abuses in the tenement sweatshops, and was especially marked in the 1910s, owing to the new militancy and effectiveness of the labor unions (see below). A shorter work week and higher wages created the margin in time and money needed to leave downtown for more congenial surroundings. In many cases the move became possible, or was hastened, when children became old enough to add to family earnings. A study of pensioned clothing workers shows that 88% of the Russian Jews left the Lower East Side after residing in the area, on the average, for 15 years. In all likelihood those who became entrepreneurs lived on the Lower East Side for a briefer time. Indeed, between 1910 and 1915 the population of the Lower East Side declined by 14% and between 1915 and 1920 by a further 11%.</p><p>The most graphic instance of the growth of a new area of settlement is the case of the Brownsville-New Lots district of Brooklyn. A small group of Jews of German origin had settled in the village of New Lots. Only in 1885, however, did they establish a synagogue, Bikur Cholim (Temple Sinai). In 1886 real-estate promoters began dividing the farmland into lots for sale, and between 1890 and 1900 the Jewish population increased from less than 3,000 to more than 15,000. Five years later it had passed 49,000, and by 1916 the Brownsville-New Lots population had reached 225,490. It was served by 72 synagogues, all Orthodox.</p><p>In 1920, the primary immigrant quarter, the Lower East Side, was continuing to lose population at a rapid pace. Other areas of settlement, some of which had assumed features of the immigrant quarter, were beginning to lose population as well. Harlem was the outstanding instance. Around 1920 it passed its peak and began a steep decline as a large and culturally important Jewish neighborhood as its Jewish residents moved to the East Bronx and Washington Heights. In the Bronx, the direction was from the East Bronx and south-central region to the upper reaches of the Grand Concourse and the Tremont-Fordham areas. A similar trend occurred in Brooklyn. Though Brownsville and New Lots were still growing in 1920, the more affluent Jews were moving to leafy Eastern Parkway, Boro Park, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/coney-island">Coney Island</a>, and Flatbush. They were being replaced, at least in part, by a less affluent exodus from Williamsburg. By 1920 a socioeconomic hierarchy of Jewish neighborhoods had come into being.</p><p>The dispersion of Jewish population and the diversification of neighborhoods were indicators and facets of the process of acculturation.</p><h3><a id="ECONOMY">economy</a></h3><p>In a number of fields the Jews of New York loomed large in the economy of the city. One group of German-Jewish families played an outstanding role in revolutionizing retailing. In the decade after the Civil War, fathers and sons entered the dry goods business and transformed their establishments into great department stores, which still bear their names. Bavarian-born Benjamin <a data-article="650076" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bloomingdale">*Bloomingdale</a> and his sons Lyman and Joseph, both born in New York City, opened a dry goods store in 1872. By 1888, under the sons' direction, Bloomingdale's employed 1,000 people in its East Side emporium. On the West Side, the department store founded by <a data-article="648126" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/altman-benjamin">Benjamin *Altman</a> and his brother Morris expanded to the point where it required 1,600 employees. The giant in the field was R.H. Macy, which Isidore and <a data-article="305064" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/straus">Nathan *Straus</a> joined in 1874, becoming the sole owners in 1887 (Oscar, a third brother, had an interest in the business as well). Lazarus Straus and his three sons had migrated to New York from Georgia in 1865 and opened a pottery and glassware house that became the springboard to their association with Macy's. Stern's, Gimbel's, and the Brooklyn firm of Abraham and Straus (A&amp;S) were also established during this time.</p><p>A significant number of German Jews entered investment banking. Closely knit by ethnic, social, and family bonds, they formed a recognizable group within the business community. Membership in the same temples and clubs, common philanthropic endeavors, and frequent marriages within the social set welded the group together, a fact that was important in their business dealings and led to frequent collaboration. Possessing excellent financial ties with banking interests in Europe – and especially in Germany – they were able to tap these sources for the U.S. market. Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company, under the leadership of <a data-article="650072" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/schiff-jacob-henry">Jacob H. *Schiff</a>, was the leading house. But other firms achieved considerable standing in the financial world, including J. and J. Seligman &amp; Co., James Speyer and Company; Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company; Hallgarten and Company; and J.S. Bache and Company. Henry Lehman, an immigrant from Germany, had opened a small shop in Montgomery, Ala., in 1844. Two brothers joined him six years later. But the Civil War disrupted their business. When hostilities ended, the brothers moved to New York, where they helped found the Cotton Exchange. During the vigorous economic expansion of the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Lehman Brothers broadened its expertise beyond commodities brokerage to merchant banking. Building a securities trading business, they became members of the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. At the turn of the century, Lehman Brothers was a founding financier of emerging retailers like Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, F.W. Woolworth Company, May Department Stores, Gimbel Brothers, and R.H. Macy.</p><p>German Jews played a central role as entrepreneurs in the city's growing ready-made clothing industry. In 1888, of 241 such clothing manufacturers, 234 were owned by Jews and accounted for an annual product of $55,000,000. The needle trade was fast becoming New York's most important industry. In 1870 the city's factories and shops produced men's clothes worth $34,456,884. In 1900 the value of goods they produced reached $103,220,201, and during the same period their work force rose from 17,084 to 30,272. The growth of the women's clothing branch of the industry was more spectacular. The value of goods produced rose from $3,824,882 in 1870 to $102,711,604 in 1900. Where 3,663 workers were employed in 1870, 44,450 were employed in 1900. In 1913 the clothing industry as a whole numbered 16,552 factories and 312,245 employees.</p><p>East European Jews began streaming into the industry in the 1880s and by 1890 were the dominant element. They nearly completely displaced the German, Irish, and English craftsmen, as well as the German-Jewish manufacturers. One estimate, made in 1912, calculated that approximately 85% of the employees in the needle trades were Jewish.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tailors (General)<br />9,595</td><td>Tailors (Women's Coats)<br />2,084</td><td>Tailors (Wholesale)<br />1,043</td><td>Cigarette Manufacturers<br />976</td></tr><tr><td>Haberdashers<br />715</td><td>Painters<br />458</td><td>Carpenters<br />443</td><td>Tinsmiths<br />417</td></tr><tr><td>Butchers<br />413</td><td>Gold + Silver Smiths<br />287</td><td>Bakers<br />270</td><td>Glaziers<br />148</td></tr><tr><td>Typesetters<br />145</td><td>Machinists<br />143</td><td>Shoemakers<br />83</td><td>Musicians<br />67</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The immigrant Jews entered the apparel trade in such numbers because it was close at hand, required little training, and allowed the congeniality of working with one's kind. The contracting system, which became widespread in the industry by 1890, was responsible in large measure for these conditions. Contractors, acting as middlemen, received cut goods from the merchant or manufacturer, rented shop space (or used their own tenement flat), bought or hired sewing machines, and recruited a labor force. Generally, about ten people worked in these "outside shops" (in contrast to the larger "inside shops," where the manufacturer directly employed the work force and where working conditions were better). The minute division of labor that prevailed permitted the employment of relatively unskilled labor. In the intensely competitive conditions of the time – compounded by the seasonal nature of the industry – hard-pressed contractors recurrently raised the required "task" of garments for payment. Under these circumstances the notorious sweatshops developed with their cramped quarters and long hours of work. In 1890 the journalist and social reformer Jacob Riis wrote:</p><blockquote><p>The homes of the Hebrew quarter are its workshops also… You are made fully aware of [economic conditions] before you have traveled the length of a single block in any of these East Side streets, by the whir of a thousand sewing-machines, worked at high pressure from earliest dawn till mind and muscle give out altogether. Every member of the family, from the youngest to the oldest, bears a hand, shut in the qualmy rooms, where meals are cooked and clothing washed and dried besides, the livelong day. It is not unusual to find a dozen persons – men, women, and children – at work in a single small room.</p></blockquote><p>Until the turn of the century, a 70-hour work week was not uncommon.</p><p>Despite notorious abuses, the system of small shops on the Lower East Side had advantages for the new arrival. Old Country ties often played a role in the system and softened harsh conditions with an element of familiarity. Manufacturers set up fellow townsmen, <i>landsleit</i>, as contractors; contractors hired <i>landsleit</i>. Bosses who were practicing Orthodox Jews made allowances for the religious requirements of their workers. The smaller shops of the contractors, in particular, were closed on the Sabbath. Reuben Sadowsky, a large cloak manufacturer, not only closed on the Sabbath but encouraged weekday services in his factory. The production system with its extreme specialization also had its advantages. The new immigrant could master a subspecialty commensurate with his experience – or lack of it – and his physical stamina, and do so quickly. Finally, the very competitiveness and instability of the industry provided opportunities and hope. The ascent from worker to contractor to small manufacturer, categories not far removed from one another, beckoned to the enterprising and ambitious.</p><p>Although the needle trade was the largest single employer of East European Jews, Jewish immigrants found employment in other industries as well. Approximately 20% of the cigar makers in the city in the early 1900s were Russian Jews. The building boom attracted Russian Jewish builders, who opened the way for their countrymen to enter the field as craftsmen. At first, because of limited capital and the discriminatory practices of the craft unions, Jewish building activity was limited primarily to renovating old tenements. But in 1914, for example, when the Jewish painters were finally accepted into the Brotherhood of Painters and Paperhangers, 5,000 joined the union. An Inside Iron and Bronze Workers Union, organized in 1913 under the auspices of the United Hebrew Trades, had a membership of 2,000 in 1918. Branches of the food-processing industry – like baking and the slaughtering and dressing of meat – were "Jewish industries" because of the ritual requirements of <i>kashrut</i>. One of the oldest labor unions in the Jewish quarter represented the bakers. It had 2,500 members by 1918.</p><p>The compact Jewish settlements had a broad working-class base. A survey of the most heavily populated Jewish wards of the Lower East Side conducted by the Baron de Hirsch Fund in 1890 showed that 60% of those gainfully employed were shopworkers in the needle trades, 6.9% were shopworkers in other industries, 8.2% were artisans (mainly painters, carpenters, and tinsmiths), and 23.5% were tradesmen, nearly half of these being peddlers. Except for Hebrew teachers and musicians, no other profession was listed, and the latter group accounted for but 1.4%.</p><p>By 1920, however, the occupational and class structure had changed considerably. The change was expressed in a decrease in the number of blue-collar workers, an increase in the number of college students, the rise of a professional group of notable size, the growth in the magnitude and income of the mercantile class, and the consolidation of a wealthy stratum composed primarily of clothing manufacturers and real estate entrepreneurs. Jacob Lestchinsky, the sociologist and economist, suggested that in 1916 nearly 40% of all gainfully employed Jews in New York City were garment workers, while the total employed in all manual work was more than 50%. By the turn of the century, a majority of the students at tuition-free City College was Jewish, and in 1918 the proportion of Jewish students was 78.7% of total enrollment. In the College of Dental and Oral Surgery, the comparable figure was 80.9%, while at the city's college for women, Hunter, the proportion was 38.7%. In 1907, 200 physicians, 115 pharmacists, and 175 dentists served downtown's Jews (the number of Jewish physicians in the borough of Manhattan rose from 450 in 1897 to 1,000 in 1907). To this group of professionals, add the growing number of lawyers. Evening law school – generally a two-year course of study – enabled a younger generation to prepare for a professional career while being self-supporting. The careers of <a data-article="686655" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hillquit-morris">Morris *Hillquit</a> and <a data-article="686656" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/london-meyer">Meyer *London</a>, labor lawyers and socialist leaders; Leo Sanders and Aaron J. Levy, active in Tammany politics; and Isaac A. Allen and Benjamin Koeningsberg, who were involved in Orthodox Jewish causes, indicate some of the avenues open to the young lawyers. Especially striking was the observation of <a data-article="686658" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/rubinow-isaac-max">Isaac M. *Rubinow</a>, physician, economist, and statistician. Writing in 1905 he noted the growth of "Russian Jewish fortunes in New York," many of which ranged between $25,000 and $200,000. "Almost every newly arrived Russian-Jewish laborer comes into contact with a Russian-Jewish employer," he wrote, and "almost every Russian-Jewish tenement dweller must pay his exorbitant rent to a Russian-Jewish landlord." He was alluding to such wealthy clothing manufacturers as Joseph H. Cohen, Louis Borgenicht, William Fischman, and Israel Unterberg, and to real-estate developers like Harry Fischel and Nathan Lamport. It was within this context of a "Jewish economy" that the Jewish labor movement in New York developed and made its impact. Organizing the Jewish clothing workers – the primary sphere of trade-union activity – entailed dealing with a constituency that considered its occupation temporary and was conservative in temper to a large degree. It meant negotiating with a multitude of bosses and a host of elusive contractors. However, the fact that the trade-union struggle took place in New York and in the garment industry also made it a Jewish communal affair. This had its mitigating consequences. Clothing manufacturers like Joseph Cohen and William Fischman were also leaders of the community. Downtown social workers like <a data-article="938953" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/moskowitz-henry">Henry *Moskowitz</a> and <a data-article="686659" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wald-lillian">Lillian *Wald</a> and their uptown sponsors, Jacob Schiff and <a data-article="650069" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/marshall-louis">Louis *Marshall</a>, were no less concerned with the good name of the community and the social integration of the newcomers. In the 1910s this led to a stabilization of the unions, vastly improved working conditions, and a pioneering formula of labor-industry relations. For the 20 years until the great strikes of 1909–16 the Jewish trade unions were weak and dispirited, despite occasional victories. The 1890 strike of the cloakmakers led by <a data-article="707819" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/barondess-joseph">Joseph *Barondess</a> was one such instance. The early success of the United Hebrew Trades was another. But ideological factionalism and seasonal apathy sapped the strength of the unions. From 1901 to 1909, the groundwork was laid, however, for the emergence of an aggressive, responsible, and socially progressive Jewish labor movement. The rising curve of immigration was drawing members and adherents of the <a data-article="437372" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bund">*Bund</a>, who were deeply committed to trade-union work. The socialist <i>Forward</i> was developing into the most widely read Yiddish daily and becoming a major educational medium for the Jewish working class. The Jewish socialist fraternal order, the Arbeiter Ring (<a data-article="655439" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/workmens-circle">*Workmen</a>'s Circle), was gaining strength. The "uprising of the twenty thousand" – a strike of the waistmakers, mostly young women – in the fall of 1909 was followed by the "great revolt" of the cloakmakers a half year later. These strikes increased the numbers and the stability of the <a data-article="394113" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/international-ladies-garment-workers-union">*International Ladies Garment Workers Union</a> (ilgwu).</p><p>One tragic event in 1911, however – a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company factory in lower Manhattan, in which 146 young women perished – led to sweeping changes in safety laws and gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement. The fire broke out near the end of a six-day, 52-hour workweek on the top three floors of a 10-story building. About 500 women, mostly Jewish and Italian immigrants, worked there behind locked doors making blouses. Within 15 minutes after the fire broke out, nearly 30% of the workers were killed. Firetruck ladders could reach only to the seventh floor. Firefighters held nets below, but so many women were jumping at the same time that the nets tore and did not hold them. Some rushed to the elevator shaft, hoping to escape by sliding down the cables, only to lose their grip. The owners of the business were acquitted of responsibility for the deaths, but in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families. The fire became the most vivid symbol of the struggle for workplace safety. As outrage mounted after the fire, the ilgwu intensified its demands for safer working conditions. New York established a Bureau of Fire Investigation and over the next three years enacted 36 safety laws.</p><p>In the summer of 1912, the furriers fought their battle for recognition. From January to March 1913 nearly 150,000 struck different branches of the apparel trades, but in particular the men's clothing industry. The strike led to the founding of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (acwa). The strikes had much in common. High emotion and a deep sense of dedication marked them all. The scene of workers pouring into the streets from their shops at the appointed hour reminded the chairman of the cloakmakers' strike of the Jews leaving Egypt. Characteristic, too, was the climate of opinion: the Jewish labor movement succeeded in mobilizing broad material and moral support for the strikers both from its own ranks and from reform circles. In all instances, moreover, prominent Jewish communal leaders intervened and mediated between Russian Jewish labor leaders and Russian Jewish manufacturers. In the best-known case, the 1910 strike, <a data-article="349959" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/brandeis-louis-dembitz">Louis *Brandeis</a>, Louis Marshall, A. Lincoln <a data-article="293601" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/filene">*Filene</a>, Henry Moskowitz, Jacob Schiff, and Meyer Bloomfield became involved at one point or another in mediating the dispute. In the furriers' strike, <a data-article="351206" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/magnes-judah-leon">Judah L. *Magnes</a>, former rabbi of Temple Emanu-El and chairman of the New York Kehillah, was instrumental in ending the dispute. He became permanent chairman of the conference committee of the fur industry and later chairman of the council of moderators of the men's clothing industry. Finally, in all cases, negotiations ended with some form of recognition for the union, a preferential or union shop, a smaller work week (generally 50 hours), a rise in wages, and arrangements for the continual arbitration of grievances. The latter provision led to the creation of joint sanitation, grievance, and arbitration committees under the chairmanship of "impartial chairmen" aided by professional staffs, which supervised the enforcement of the decisions. This groundbreaking innovation in labor relations reflected a particular ethnic-economic reality and a particular Jewish group response.</p><h3><a id="COMMUNAL_LIFE">communal life</a></h3><p>In 1870 the New York Jewish community appeared to be well on its way to achieving homogeneity in form and content, directed by its Americanized element of German origin. For this group, Jewish communal life expressed itself in membership in a Reform temple, and sponsorship of Jewish welfare institutions. Lay leaders of the established community found in the institutional forms a way to maintain their Jewish identity in a manner they considered compatible with American practice. Though they drew upon Jewish communal traditions, these leaders were profoundly affected by the model of American liberal Protestantism with its emphasis on denominationalism, voluntarism, and morals rather than ritual.</p><p>By 1900 there were 14 Reform synagogues in the city: nine in Manhattan, one in the Bronx, and four in Brooklyn. In 1918 there were 16 Reform and 32 Conservative synagogues. These synagogues held services on weekends, sponsored one-day-a-week religious schools, and engaged university-trained rabbis. Their weekly sermons were reported by the leading newspapers as part of the notable sermons in the city's houses of worship.</p><p>Among the distinguished Reform rabbis who served in New York between 1870 and 1920 were Gustave Gottheil, Joseph Silverman, Judah L. Magnes, and Hyman G. Enelow at Emanu-El, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/judaism-biographies/david-einhorn">David Einhorn</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/judaism-biographies/kaufmann-kohler">Kaufmann Kohler</a>, and Samuel Schulman at Beth El (later amalgamated with Emanu-El), Aaron Wise, and Rudolph Grossman at Rodeph Shalom, Adolf Huebsch, Alexander Kohut, and Isaac S. Moses at Ahavath Chesed (later the Central Synagogue), and Maurice H. Harris at Temple Israel of Harlem (later on the West Side). The establishment of the Free Synagogue in 1907 as a pulpit for <a data-article="297452" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wise-stephen-samuel">Stephen S. *Wise</a> was a novel religious development, for its services were conducted on Sunday mornings at Carnegie Hall, and it also embarked upon a wide-ranging program of social service. Wise, who came to New York in 1907, and Magnes, who arrived in 1904, represented a new type of Jewish minister. American-bred and American-trained, they were young, excellent orators, and forceful – even daring – in espousing their causes and attracting large followings. Wise became best known for his attacks on municipal corruption and industrial conditions, while Magnes' main efforts were directed toward cultural and social improvements within the Jewish community.</p><p>During the last third of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the established community built a number of large and progressive philanthropic institutions: general relief agencies, hospitals, oldage homes, orphan asylums, vocational training schools, and neighborhood centers. The outlook of these institutions reflected the receptivity of uptown's Jewish leaders to the social thought and patrician practices of the time. The emergence of scientific philanthropy, with its insistence on thorough investigation of the needy applicant, emphasis on economic and vocational rehabilitation, and espousal of the professionalization of welfare services, guided the policies of the older Jewish charities. So did the related sociological view of poverty that emphasized environmental factors, uplift, and "preventive work."</p><p>The United Hebrew Charities (uhc; formed in 1874 by six philanthropic societies) was illustrative of this development. In addition to poor relief, uhc operated an employment bureau and a vocational training school, granted loans to aid families launching small businesses, and maintained a work room where women were paid while they learned one of the garment trades. Its medical department employed a physician, visiting nurses, and social workers who handled home births and consumption cases. In 1911 uhc opened a bureau to meet the problems of family desertion. The agency's expenditures rose from $46,000 in 1880, to $153,000 in 1900, to $344,000 in 1917. In 1886, 2,500 applied for assistance, and in 1900, 23,264 asked for aid. Beginning in 1901, the number of families receiving material aid decreased steadily from 8,125 to 6,014 in 1916. The vast majority were by then Russian Jewish immigrants. (As late as 1885 the largest single group of applicants were of non-East European stock.) An excerpt from a Yiddish article published in 1884 suggests the gulf that existed between the "professional methods" employed in the uptown-sponsored institutions, and the immigrant clients:</p><blockquote><p>In the philanthropic institutions of our aristocratic German Jews you see beautiful offices, desks, all decorated, but strict and angry faces. Every poor man is questioned like a criminal, is looked down upon; every unfortunate suffers self-degradation and shivers like a leaf, just as if he were standing before a Russian official.</p></blockquote><p><a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/child-care">Child care</a> was a priority. Two of the leading institutions in the city were the Hebrew Orphan Asylum at Amsterdam Avenue and 136<sup>th</sup> Street, which in 1917 had a capacity of 1,250 children and an annual budget of $407,130, and the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society. The latter moved to Pleasantville, New York in 1912, where it introduced the "cottage plan," a model program. The uptown Jews were the sponsors of Mount Sinai Hospital. In 1904 it moved to its present site, Fifth Avenue and 100<sup>th</sup> Street. By 1916 the hospital had reached a capacity of 523 beds; its dispensary treated 243,161 patients.</p><p>These institutions were served by a distinguished group of lay and professional leaders. Lee K. Frankel and Morris D. Waldman of the United Hebrew Charities, Ludwig B. Bernstein of the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Orphan Asylum, Solomon Lowenstein of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum, and Dr. Sigismund S. Goldwater of Mount Sinai belonged to the first rank of administrators. Philanthropists like Jacob H. Schiff, Irving Lehman, Isidore Straus, and George Blumenthal were intimately connected with the routine management as well as with the financing of the Montefiore Home, the 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Young Men's Hebrew Association (ymha), the Educational Alliance, and Mount Sinai Hospital, respectively.</p><p>The notion that philanthropic institutions should be non-sectarian clashed with a second approach, which stressed the encouragement of Jewish cultural and religious activity. Supporters of the latter position debated such fundamental issues as the meaning of Americanization, the legitimacy of preserving the Old World heritage and its secular offsprings, and the nature of inter-group relationships within the New York Jewish community. These issues found their clearest institutional expression in the work of the Educational Alliance, the largest and most influential community center on the Lower East Side. In 1889 a number of uptown societies sponsoring Jewish cultural activities on the Lower East Side amalgamated and formed the Hebrew Institute. Four years later, reorganization led to a change in name, emphasizing its nonsectarian stand by replacing Hebrew Institute with Educational Alliance. Its official scope was "of an Americanizing, educational, social, and humanizing character." In 1897 the agency's president, Isidore Straus, explained that "our work may seem sectarian… [because] we have reached chiefly Jews, but this is due to the fact that the neighborhood is inhabited principally by Jews." Nevertheless, the Alliance did recognize the background of its constituents. The library and reading room were well stocked with Yiddish, Hebrew, and Russian books and periodicals. A synagogue and a religious school were established as well. The Alliance followed on the heels of the founding of the Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East Side by Lillian D. Wald in 1893. Wald, who became one of the most influential and respected social reformers of the 20th century, began teaching health and hygiene to immigrant women. Within a decade the Settlement included a team of 20 nurses and was offering an array of innovative and effective social, recreation, and educational services. In the early 1900s, the Alliance softened its attitude toward Yiddish and Yiddish culture. <a data-article="398163" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/masliansky-zvi-hirsch">Zvi H. *Masliansky</a>'s discourses became a weekly event that drew large crowds, as did guest appearances by such Yiddish literary figures as Shalom Aleichem. Orthodox Jewish leaders, however, still viewed the Alliance as a bastion of <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/reform-judaism">Reform Judaism</a> located in the very heart of their quarter, while to the radical intelligentsia it represented the "uptown's" use of charity and Americanization to silence social protest. Despite the opposition, Jews took advantage of the opportunities the institution opened for them. There were English-language classes and naturalization courses for adults, preschool instruction for newly arrived immigrant children, literary and civic clubs, music classes, and a children's orchestra, drama circles, and art exhibits. The Breadwinner's College, inspired by Thomas Davidson, a physical education program, and the Aguilar Free Library added to the appeal. During the first decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, as many as 37,000 people went weekly to the main building and to the two branch centers. Some of those who served as key members of the staff were David Blaustein, Henry Leipziger, Paul Abelson, and Belle Moskowitz. Similar agencies of smaller scope were the Jewish Settlement House and the Temple Emanu-El Brotherhood.</p><p>Important as uptown's welfare agencies were in aiding the immigrants, they at best complemented the communal order being created by the East European Jews. Transplanted religious institutions – synagogues, <i>talmud torahs</i>, and traditional charities – constituted a major part of that order. Mutual aid associations, <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/social-organizations/private-organizations/fraternal-orders">fraternal orders</a>, and benevolent societies provided other avenues of group endeavor. Finally, secular institutions spun a network of facilities, adding to the heterogeneity of Jewish life and enriching it intellectually.</p><p>In organizing their synagogues, the first and most typical communal undertaking, the immigrants mostly established congregations of <i>landsleit</i>, deriving their synagogues' names mostly from the congregants' town of origin. <i>Landsleit</i> congregations proliferated. In 1887 Moses Weinberger estimated there were 130 Orthodox congregations in New York City, by far the largest number on the Lower East Side. By 1902 the number of synagogues there had reached 254, and by 1917, 418. A 1917 study estimated that 40% of 365 congregations located in the older sections of the Lower East Side possessed traditional adult study groups, 45% free loan associations, 33% sick benefit societies, and 91% cemetery plots. Their average seating capacity was about 180. In addition, 50 to 70 "temporary" synagogues operated for the High Holidays on the East Side alone. In 1917 only 20% of the permanent congregations owned their synagogue building.</p><p>A few older synagogues gained stature as central institutions in the downtown community. They transcended the localism of <i>landsmanshaft</i>, though they still retained a regional identity. These included the Beth Hamidrash Hagadol on Norfolk Street, the Kalvarier Sons of Israel on Pike Street, the First Hungarian Congregation Ohab Zedek on Norfolk Street, and the First Roumanian Congregation Shaarei Shomayim on Rivington Street. (The Beth Hamidrash Hagadol is still located in the Norfolk Street building it acquired in 1888.) These larger synagogues were also among the minority of congregations able to support rabbis. In 1887 there were three or four East European rabbis in New York, and in 1917 the number may not have reached more than 50. Among the most prominent were Philip H. Klein of Ohab Zedek, Moses Z. Margolis of Kehillath Jeshurun of Yorkville, Shlomo E. Jaffe of Beth Hamidrash Hagadol, Simon J. Finkelstein of Oheb Shalom in Brownsville, and Gabriel Z. Margolis of Adath Israel, an East Side mutual aid and burial society. In 1917 the number of congregations in the newer centers of Russian Jewish population was: the Bronx, 35; Williamsburg, 49; and Brownsville and East New York, 70. All of New York City contained 784 permanent and 343 temporary synagogues. In 90% of them, Yiddish was the language of the sermon and of public announcements.</p><p>The plethora of small synagogues, the localism that produced them, and their constant precarious financial condition impeded their efficient operation and growth. Rivalries and vested interests compounded the situation and dogged all efforts at community collaboration. There were two signal attempts at unity. In 1887 a number of Orthodox congregations federated for the purpose of creating a central religious authority to be headed by a chief rabbi. A renowned European scholar, Rabbi Jacob Joseph of Vilna, was installed as chief rabbi in 1888. The attempt failed, chiefly because of the inability of the chief rabbi and his supporting organization to establish communal regulation of <i>kashrut</i> and in the refusal of other rabbis to accept the chief rabbi's leadership. In 1902 Rabbi Joseph died in poverty. Under the auspices of the New York Kehillah (see below), a renewed effort was made from 1910 on to create an authoritative board of rabbis and to federate all Orthodox institutions in its support. Once again the supervision of <i>kashrut</i> was considered the key to its success. By bringing <i>kashrut</i> supervision directly under the purview of the board it was hoped that an assured income would be realized from the fees of supervision, which would then be used for financing neighborhood rabbinical courts, placing rabbis and other religious functionaries on the community's budget, and providing for Jewish religious education and other Orthodox needs. After early progress, the undertaking foundered. The community was too fragmentized; the struggle for a livelihood too consuming; and the Old World rabbis ill equipped to provide the kind of leadership required in the complex new conditions of the U.S.</p><p>Orthodox religious education suffered as a consequence. In 1909 the first systematic study of Jewish education, by Mordecai M. Kaplan, found that three-quarters of the Jewish children of school age received no religious education at all. Of those who did, 27% supplemented their <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/public-school">public school</a> sessions with attendance in 468 or more improvised, ungraded, one-room private schools, the <i>ḥadarim</i>. The level of instruction on the whole was poor; the <i>ḥadarim</i> were beyond the reach of any form of communal supervision. About 20% of those receiving Jewish instruction attended the city's 24 <i>talmud torahs</i>. Since these institutions were supported by independent associations and accepted children who could not pay the tuition fee, they were in effect communal schools, supported by small contributions from over 6,000 people. The eight largest schools averaged 881 students, and were generally superior to the <i>ḥadarim</i>. The most auspicious endeavor to upgrade the <i>talmud torahs</i> – by means of modern textbooks, a graded curriculum, modern pedagogical methods, improved preparation and remuneration of teachers – was sponsored by the Bureau of Education of the Kehillah beginning in 1910. Dr. Samson Benderly directed the bureau and Jacob H. Schiff and his family were its chief financial supporters. Benderly encountered considerable opposition from Orthodox circles who feared the bureau's interference with the independence of the <i>talmud torahs</i> and mistrusted it because of the religious views of its lay supporters and staff. Nevertheless, in its first seven years, the bureau achieved notable results. It recruited and trained a group of young educators, popularized the notion of communal responsibility for Jewish education, established model schools, and conducted educational research. The bureau survived the demise of the Kehillah.</p><p>The year 1912 saw the beginning of the Young Israel movement. Immigrants' sons, concerned with what they viewed as the erosion of Orthodoxy, sought to combat radicalism, <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/reform-judaism">Reform Judaism</a>, and indifference to the tradition by making the Orthodox service more appealing to younger worshipers. In 1915 Yeshivat Etz Chaim and the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary united, and the institution began to offer a general high school education as well as yeshivah studies.</p><p>The comradeship of <i>landsleit</i> and the wish for protection in case of disability or death produced a vast network of mutual benefit societies, benevolent associations, and fraternal orders. Originally part of the congregations, they increasingly developed into separate organizations, offering some form of insurance, sick benefits, and interest-free loans, as well as cemetery rights. In 1917 there were about 1,000 such independent societies in New York with an aggregate membership of over 100,000, many of which found it financially advantageous to affiliate with a fraternal order. The largest order in New York City was the Independent Order Brith Abraham, which in 1917 had 90,000 members in 354 lodges. Various ideological movements recognized the attractiveness of the fraternal order and organized their own. The Arbeiter Ring (Workmen's Circle), appealing to workingmen in the name of socialism and insurance benefits, had 25,000 members in the city, and Zionists and Labor Zionists each had their own fraternal order.</p><p><i>Landsmanshaft</i> societies too began to form federations. The Galician Jews were the first, in 1903. The Polish <i>landsmanshaftn</i> united in 1908, while the Romanian Jews were split into two federations. In 1911 the Federation of Oriental Jews was established, reflecting the increasing numbers coming from the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/turkish-and-ottoman-history/ottoman-empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. These were loose groupings. The unifying factor was some joint effort at overseas aid and some major philanthropic undertaking. The Galicians supported the Har Moriah Hospital, the Polish Jews Beth David Hospital, and the Bessarabians the Hebrew National Orphan Home.</p><p>This concern for self-help and for one's own welfare agency also produced central institutions that came to be identified with the city's East European Jewish subcommunity as a whole, of which the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society (hias) was perhaps the most prominent. Beginning in 1909, when two older organizations merged to create it, hias expanded rapidly and succeeded in winning broad support in the immigrant community. Beth Israel Hospital, organized in 1890, was an instance of a downtown welfare facility whose standing became comparable to the older community institutions. It was founded in 1890 to provide services like kosher food and places for physicians of East European origin, neither of which were available at Mount Sinai Hospital. By 1917 it had 130 beds and a budget of $155,000. One of the most respected community-wide bodies was the Hebrew Free Loan Society, established in 1892. By 1916 it had branches in the Bronx and in Brooklyn, and had granted 24,330 loans, aggregating $711,940.</p><p>During the first decade of the century, influential leaders became increasingly aware of the social costs of institutional parochialism, profusion, and confusion. The sharp rise in immigration following 1903 underscored the need for more rational use of the resources and communal wealth. Uptown Jews, marginally identified with the total Jewish community, sought better ways to stem the social disorganization they sensed in the Jewish quarter and to expedite the integration of the immigrants. Some downtown leaders recognized the ineffectualness of their own institutions. In both sectors of the community some viewed with alarm the alienation of the younger generation from Judaism and Jewish life.</p><p>These concerns had led to two seminal events. The first was the short-lived New York Kehillah, an attempt to create a united community structure. The immediate catalyst was the accusation of police commissioner Theodore A. Bingham in 1908 that 50% of the criminals in the city were Jews. (Though the figure was exaggerated, crime in the Jewish quarter was a vexing problem.) Led by <a data-article="351206" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/magnes-judah-leon">Judah *Magnes</a>, a coalition of representative leaders in 1909 established the Kehillah as a federation of Jewish organizations. Magnes served as chairman until its demise in 1922. The Kehillah created a number of bureaus, for education, social morals (dealing with crime), industry (concerned with labor relations), and philanthropy. In addition, it organized a rabbinical board and a school for training communal workers. The Kehillah's productive years, however, were brief. By 1916 it had encountered financial problems, which led to the separation of its bureaus. Ties to the elitist <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion/american">American Jewish Committee</a> drew it into controversies over the establishment of an American Jewish congress. During World War i interest was diverted to overseas relief and international Jewish affairs, while Magnes' pacifist activity crippled his effectiveness as chairman and adversely affected the Kehillah. These factors made it impossible to overcome the fragmented state of organized Jewish life. Though a number of the activities the Kehillah initiated proved to be of lasting significance, its failure pointed to the impediments that lay on the path of community organization. No similar attempt would be made again.</p><p>The establishment in 1917 of the Federation for the Support of Jewish Philanthropies, far more limited in scope than the Kehillah, proved more lasting. The federation movement to coordinate fund raising and encourage communal planning came late to New York, and from the early 1900s it encountered the opposition of the older philanthropic institutions sponsored by the German Jews, who feared it might impinge upon their independence. Some, moreover, objected to a federation of Jewish charities since such a grouping cast the pall of sectarianism upon their welfare agencies. However, the proliferation of East European institutions, the failure of the Kehillah as a device of social control, and the consequent threat to their own hegemony softened their opposition to federation.</p><p>As in other cities, the New York federation encompassed the larger welfare bodies and was therefore overwhelmingly a federation of the German-Jewish philanthropies primarily interested in nonsectarian <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/social-1">social welfare</a> work. Of the original trustees of the federation only three were East European; of 54 constituent societies, four belonged to the East European community. A smaller Brooklyn Federation of Jewish Charities was established in 1909. Its 1917 budget was $174,000 compared to the New York federation's budget of $2,117,410.</p><p>There were signs, however, that the New York federation might develop into more than a central fund-raising agency. Soon after its establishment, under the pressure of the group that had supported the Kehillah, the federation accepted five <i>talmud torahs</i> and the Kehillah's Bureau of Jewish Education as beneficiary agencies. This implied that the federation would concern itself not only with the relief of distress but with the support of Jewish cultural endeavor. Jewish education was to become a responsibility of the Jewish community's exchequer. The federation also indicated in its first year that it expected to become the spokesman of the entire community. But the statements proved little more than declarations of intention.</p><p>After 1900 Zionism and Socialism played, with varying success, many-sided roles in the organizational and cultural life of the New York Jewish community. In institutional terms, the Zionist achievements were minimal. The Federation of American Zionists, the Order Sons of Zion, Mizrachi, Po'alei Zion, the Jewish National Workers Alliance, Hadassah, and the Intercollegiate Zionist Association in 1917 numbered about 8,500 members who belonged to 95 loosely organized chapters. The influence of Zionism, however, went beyond membership figures. Much of the interest in Hebrew culture, Jewish education, and community planning stemmed from Zionist circles. Up to World War i the cultural Zionists who emphasized the need to revitalize Jewish cultural life in the Diaspora predominated. Judah Magnes, Israel Friedlaender, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/judaism-biographies/henrietta-szold">Henrietta Szold</a>, and Mordecai Kaplan gave vigorous expression to this position from the lecture podium, in the press, and as professional and lay leaders of Jewish institutions. The socialist Po'alei Zion was similarly short on numbers and organizational success but strong on ideology and polemics. It constituted an intellectual force of significance at a time when the leadership of the Jewish labor movement was largely cosmopolitan and assimilationist in outlook. Following the outbreak of World War i, Zionists of all shades vastly increased their influence in the community through the Jewish congress movement. In June 1917, 125,000 participated in the election of delegates from New York City. The 100 delegates elected to represent New York's Jews were overwhelmingly of East European origin, the majority sympathizers of Zionism.</p><p>The Socialists, through the Workmen's Circle (Arbeiter Ring), possessed a stronger organizational framework than the Zionists. The order's 240 New York lodges and 25,000 members made it in 1917 the second-largest fraternal order in the city. Though the Workmen's Circle drew its membership from the Yiddish-speaking immigrants, it did not consciously identify itself with the Jewish community as a whole until World War i. During the war years Jewish Socialists began participating in Jewish communal affairs. The Workmen's Circle, Jewish labor unions, and the Jewish Socialist Federation (12 branches in New York) were active in the local fund-raising campaigns for overseas relief. They also joined the American Jewish congress movement, and the Workmen's Circle in a principal policy change that undertook direct support of Jewish cultural activity like Yiddish schools.</p><h3><a id="CULTURAL_LIFE">cultural life</a></h3><p>The Yiddish-speaking masses who settled in New York created a rich and varied cultural life. No less than the community's institutional structure, this life aided the newcomers in their adjustment to the great metropolis. The very size of the immigrant community, its compactness and heterogeneity, and the impact of the new condition of freedom encouraged a multiplicity of cultural undertakings. Between 1872 and 1917, for example, about 150 journals in Yiddish appeared. Ideologues, literati, artists, and entrepreneurs competed in offering guidance, information, entertainment, and psychic relief for a generation in the throes of accommodation to a strange civilization.</p><p>The Yiddish-language daily press in particular served these ends (see <a data-article="331139" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/press">*Press</a>, Jewish, in U.S.A.). By the early 1900s, four stable dailies had evolved: the Orthodox and Zionist <i>Tageblat</i>; the <a data-article="358014" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jewish-morning-journale"><i>*Jewish Morning Journal</i></a>, Orthodox, conservative on social issues, and anti-Zionist; the radical and nationalistic <i>Warheit</i>; and the socialist <a data-article="358033" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jewish-daily-forward"><i>*Forward</i></a>. In 1914 the <a data-article="642046" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/tob"><i>*Tog</i></a>, pro-Zionist and liberal, was established; it absorbed the <i>Warheit</i> in 1919. The estimated daily circulation for New York City in 1916 was: <i>Forward</i> (149,170), <i>Jewish Morning Journal</i> (81,375), <i>Warheit Tageblat</i> (41,335). It was estimated in 1917 that nearly 600,000 people in New York City read the Yiddish newspapers daily. Besides the staple of general and Jewish news the papers contained serialized novels, literary criticism, political essays, and a woman's page. The <i>Forward</i> created the <i>Bintl Brief</i> column of personal woe and editorial advice. It was so successful that it inspired imitators in other papers. Editorials were slashing and polemical, frequently dealing with municipal problems and local Jewish affairs. The considerable advertising included notices of theaters, cantorial performances, books published, medicine and health aids, and, in the <i>Jewish Morning Journal</i>, want-ads. The <i>Forward</i>, in particular, sponsored communal undertakings like theater benefits and other fund-raisers.</p><p>The functions of the Yiddish press made its publishers and editors major communal leaders. Jacob Saphirstein of the <i>Jewish Morning Journal</i> was deeply involved in rabbinical politics. Leon Kamaiky, a proprietor of the <i>Tageblat</i>, was a vice president of the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society and a member of the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion/american">American Jewish Committee</a> and the executive committee of the Kehillah. <i>Forward</i> editor <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/hebrew-literature-biographies/abraham-cahan">Abraham Cahan</a>'s position in the Jewish labor movement was less formal but more powerful. Indeed, the preeminent place of the Yiddish press and its editors was recognized uptown. In 1902 Louis Marshall established the <i>Yiddishe Velt</i> in an effort to assert his group's influence. The initiative that led to the establishment of the <i>Tog</i> in 1914 came from the same circles and for the same reasons.</p><p>The role of the Yiddish press found its fullest expression in the <i>Forward</i>. Cahan was the great innovator and his paper the pacemaker of Yiddish journalism. His apprenticeship as a reporter for the New York <i>Commercial Advertiser</i> under <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/lincoln-steffens">Lincoln Steffens</a> served him well in turning the <i>Forward</i> into the leading Yiddish daily. The simple, direct style of the paper, its humanistic, undogmatic brand of socialism and its eschewal of the Orthodox-baiting of earlier socialist journals won it great popularity. Cahan appealed to highbrow no less than lowbrow tastes, and side by side with the <i>Bintl Brief</i> he published virtually every Yiddish author of note. From 1912 the <i>Forward</i> occupied its own ten-story building on East Broadway, close to the Educational Alliance. The United Hebrew Trades, the Jewish Socialist Federation, and the Arbeiter Ring (Workmen's Circle) had their offices in the building. The <i>Forward</i> was the focal center of the Jewish labor movement, a powerful cultural factor in the community, and thus had become a force for Jewish group continuity. Yiddish was so ubiquitous that when Shalom Aleichem, the great storyteller, died in 1916, his funeral was one of the largest public events in New York history.</p><p>Weeklies and monthlies filled out the broad range of ideas, movements, and professional interests of the New York community. Some, like the <i>Amerikaner</i> and the <i>IdisheGazetten</i>, were weekly family supplements of existing newspapers. The anarchist <i>Freie Arbeiter Stimme</i>, the Zionist <i>IdisheFolk</i>, and the socialist <i>Zukunft</i> were representative of the literary and political journals sponsored by the various ideological camps. More local in their interests were journals published by the trade unions: the <i>Fortschritt</i> of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and <i>Naye Post</i> of the Joint Board of the Cloak and Skirt Makers Union. Catering to small audiences were the Hebrew journals <i>Ha-Ivri</i> and <i>Ha-Toren</i>, and the Ladino <i>La America</i> (see <a data-article="358032" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/newspapers-hebrew">Hebrew *Newspapers</a>, N. America). The Yiddish journals and dailies drew to New York and sustained a significant colony of intellectuals, writers, poets, and critics whose work was read in the press and discussed in the lecture halls and coffeehouses of the East Side.</p><p>The Yiddish theater reinforced the press. It was, Moses Rischin wrote, "educator, dreammaker, chief agent of charity, social center, and recreation hub for the family." Melodrama and romantic musicals depicted historical and topical events drawn from the classic Jewish past, the "old home," immigrant life in the New World, and current American affairs. Nearly all weekday performances were benefits raising funds for some charity, strike fund, or literary journal. About 1900, three theaters were devoted exclusively to Yiddish drama. Together with other houses giving occasional performances, they drew about 25,000 patrons a week. By 1917 the number of houses presenting Yiddish theater reached seven, including one in Harlem and one in Brownsville.</p><p>Jewish immigrant life in New York inspired some of the earliest belles-lettres by Jews in English, notably Cahan's <i>Yekl</i> (1896) and <i>The Rise of David Levinsky</i> (1917). For most second-generation American Jews, Yiddish literature was a closed book, and Jewish themes in the language of the land were of peripheral interest. The Anglo-Jewish weekly <i>The American Hebrew</i> supplied the older settlement with a resume of Jewish news and social happenings. Its circulation was less than 10,000.</p><h3><a id="POLITICS_AND_CIVIC_AFFAIRS">politics and civic affairs</a></h3><p>For Jews, as for all minority groups, election to public office meant social recognition and acceptance into the body politic of the city. Before the 1900s the number of Jewish officeholders was small, their posts for the most part minor, their ethnic identity an insignificant factor, and their political careers brief. Three Jewish congressmen were elected in New York City between 1870 and 1899, and all served but one term; the most prominent was Isidore Straus. Considerably more served in the state legislature. Among them was Joseph Blumenthal, who was a member of the Committee of Seventy, which played a role in the downfall of the Tweed Ring. Joseph Seligman and Simon Sterne were other members of that reform group. Blumenthal was a trustee and president of Shearith Israel and from 1886 to 1901 president of the board of trustees of the Jewish Theological Seminary. In municipal government Adolph L. Sanger, elected in 1885 as an anti-Tammany Democrat, served as president of the Board of Aldermen for one term. He, too, was active in Jewish communal affairs, serving at different times as president of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites and vice president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. In the 1890s Edward Lauterbach, a specialist in railway law and a director of a number of street railways, served for three years as chairman of the Republican County Committee. Lauterbach was a director of the Hebrew Benevolent and Orphan Asylum and the Hebrew Technical Institute. Jews held minor judgeships prior to 1900, and only one, Albert Cardozo, served on the state Supreme Court. In 1871, in the wake of the Tweed scandals, Cardozo resigned to avoid impeachment (his son was <a data-article="400871" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/cardozo-benjamin-nathan">Benjamin Nathan *Cardozo</a>, on the Court of Appeals from 1914 until his elevation to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1932).</p><p>In the years following 1900 the densely populated Jewish neighborhoods and the rising political awareness of the immigrants carried increasing political weight. That a number of assembly districts and several congressional districts had Jewish majorities or pluralities was reflected in the ethnic origin of the candidates, the particular issues raised, and the language of the campaigns. The number of Jewish voters was large enough to influence the outcome of city-wide elections. Though uptown Jews denied it, a "Jewish vote" existed. It was not prone to act en bloc, but nevertheless responded to group interests and ethnic pride and was unafraid to demand its political due.</p><p>Jews came of age as a political force during the domination of the Tammany Hall political machine. Led by astute and, if need be, ruthless politicians, Tammany offered a host of services in return for votes, and some of its leaders were attuned to the moods and needs of their Jewish constituents. Although a lag existed between Jewish numbers and numbers of Jewish officeholders, Tammany was sensitive to ethnic ambitions. In 1900 Henry M. Goldfogle went to Congress as representative of the Lower East Side, serving until 1921 with the exception of two terms. By 1910 Aaron J. Levy and Moritz Graubard were entrenched as East Side assemblymen, and Jews received 5 to 8% of the mayor's top appointments.</p><p>Support of Tammany was not, however, monolithic, particularly in mayoral and presidential campaigns. Anti-Tammany forces recognized this, and when mounting major reform campaigns, paid particular attention to the Jewish immigrant neighborhoods. In 1901, for example, the Fusion ticket flooded the Jewish districts with Yiddish circulars. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/education-biographies/seth-low">Seth Low</a> and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/william-travers-jerome">William Travers Jerome</a> were elected mayor and attorney general, respectively. Jacob A. Cantor, who had fought for tenement house reform as an assemblyman in the 1880s, was elected borough president of Manhattan as a Reform Democrat. The publisher <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing-biographies/william-randolph-hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, in his effort to defeat the Tammany candidate for mayor in 1905, carried the Jewish East Side. His <i>New York American</i> had featured stories of Russian barbarism and solicited funds for the relief of pogrom victims. Hearst even launched a Yiddish newspaper for a time. John P. Mitchel, elected mayor in 1913 on a Fusion anti-Tammany ticket, won broad support in the Jewish districts. Henry Moskowitz, head of the Madison House Settlement and a native downtown reformer, became Mitchel's commissioner of Civil Service. The downtown voters exhibited similar independence in presidential elections. From 1888 to 1912 no party carried the Eighth Assembly District, heart of the Jewish quarter, twice in succession. However, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/theodore-roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, a Republican, was a particular favorite.</p><p>Among the uptown Jews a group of patrician "good government" reformers emerged who helped finance these repeated efforts to dislodge Tammany. Among them were men like Nathan and <a data-article="295880" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/straus-oscar">Oscar *Straus</a>, who belonged to the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/grover-cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> wing of the Democratic Party, and liberal Republicans like Jacob Schiff, <a data-article="649780" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/seligman">Isaac N. *Seligman</a>, and <a data-article="650067" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lewisohn">Adolph *Lewisohn</a>. They assumed a particular responsibility for wooing their downtown brethren away from the "twin evils" of Tammany and socialism by supporting the reform candidates in their East Side campaigns.</p><p>Socialism indeed had a significant political following in the Jewish immigrant districts. On the Lower East Side the Socialists could count on a straight party vote of about 15%, and in some Jewish election districts in Brooklyn and the Bronx it may have been even higher. However, only when the party offered a candidate able and willing to appeal to the particular interest and ethnic sentiment of the East European Jew did it win at election time. In 1914 it sent Meyer London to Congress, the first socialist elected to the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/house-representatives">House of Representatives</a> and the first elected socialist for any office from New York City. London, a lawyer for a score of Jewish labor unions, lived in the Jewish quarter, and thus spoke the language of the immigrant. He eschewed party dogma. Reelected in 1916, he won a third term in 1920 despite the fact that his party was then in complete disarray. Of special interest were the elections of 1917. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/morris-hillquit">Morris Hillquit</a>, the outstanding figure in the Socialist Party, showed remarkable strength in his bid for the mayoralty. He won 22% of the vote – twice that of the Republican candidate. Ten socialist assemblymen went to Albany, seven aldermen to City Hall, and one socialist, Jacob Panken, was elected municipal court judge. The vote reflected the strong anti-war sentiment among the East European Jews as much as it did socialist sentiment.</p><p>The war years expedited the social processes that molded a variegated and fragmented Jewish public into a more homogeneous ethnic community. The same processes integrated that community into the larger polity. War brought prosperity, which enabled families to leave overcrowded immigrant districts for a better, more "American" environment and so accelerated the process of acculturation. The war also confronted all Americans with the problem of their group identity, Americanized Jews of German origin no less than recently arrived East European Jews. Though it brought to the surface sharp tensions, the Jews of New York by 1920 could see themselves as a major group at home in the city.</p><p>[Arthur Aryeh Goren]</p><h2><a id="_1920-1970">1920–1970</a></h2><h3><a id="DEMOGRAPHY_1">demography</a></h3><p>Following World War i the Jewish population of New York City grew moderately to 1,765,000 in 1927 and to 2,035,000 in 1937. It tapered off around 2,100,000 in 1950, and slowly decreased as Jews moved to the suburbs of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/long-island">Long Island</a>, Westchester, and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> from the 1950s. By 1960 the Jewish population of the city had declined to 1,936,000, while that of the metropolitan area increased to 2,401,600, owing to the large growth in the suburban counties (see <a data-article="356739" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/new-york-state">*New York State</a>). The city's Jewish population, which fell further to 1,836,000 by 1968, was aging as younger families moved out. The move by Jews and other middle-class whites in search of more comfortable residences and greener neighborhoods was intensified from the mid-1950s by negative developments, primarily an increase in crime and racial tensions, a loss of confidence in the public schools, a perceived inadequacy of middle-class housing, and a decline of municipal services.</p><p>No less than during immigrant years, New York Jews preferred to dwell near one another. Thus, 676,000 of Brooklyn's 857,000 Jews in 1940 resided in areas where Jews formed 40% or more of the total population; and later, in 1958, 388,000 of the Bronx's 493,000 Jews were similarly concentrated. Anti-Jewish discrimination in the sale and rental of housing had been effectively quashed before 1950, except for isolated instances in opulent areas of Manhattan.</p><p>Within the city's five boroughs, Jewish population centers shifted as Jews abandoned highly congested Jewish areas and moved to more widely dispersed areas farther from the older, more centrally located neighborhoods. In 1918, 696,000 Jews (46% of the city's total Jewish population), lived in Manhattan. Most of them were on the Lower East Side and uptown in Harlem. Masses of Jews left the Lower East Side as their economic circumstances improved, mainly before the Depression of 1929. While 314,200 Jews lived on the Lower East Side in 1923, by 1940 only 73,700 remained. By 1960 about 70,000 Jews lived there, mainly in cooperative housing projects sponsored by Jewish-dominated trade unions, and made up 34% of the general population compared with 40% in 1930. West and East Harlem, for a time the home of wealthier immigrant Jews, had about 177,000 Jews in 1923. Immediately thereafter Harlem became a black neighborhood; fewer than 5,000 Jews remained in 1930 and in 1940, only 2,000.</p><p>Many Jews from Manhattan and other areas moved north to the more recently settled Bronx, where in 1918 they totaled about 211,000. By 1927 about 420,000 Jews lived there, primarily in its south and south-central districts, where they made up 40% and 70%, respectively, of the general population in 1925. By 1937 the Bronx Jewish population rose above 592,000, making that borough 44% Jewish. As new subway lines and apartment buildings were built, Jews moved increasingly to more northerly and less populous regions of the Bronx. The number of Jews in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/south">the South</a> Bronx fell from 34,200 in 1923 to less than 15,000 in 1960. Tremont, in the west-central Bronx, which had 121,000 Jews (96% of its total population) in 1925, dropped to about 44,000 before the 1960s, most of whom also left the area during the decade that followed. However, nearby Fordham rose from 13,600 Jews in 1923 to 83,350 in 1930 and 103,000 in 1960, about 48% of the general population. The middle-class West Bronx Jewish population increased from 26,000 in 1923 to 142,886 in 1940. It declined to 121,000 in 1960, when it was still 65% of the general population, and this downward trend continued. The Jewish population of Pelham Parkway, in the northeast Bronx, rose from 3,000 in 1923 to 65,000 by 1960, or 48% of the general population, and continued to rise. Following the general trend toward the suburbs, Jews began leaving the Bronx in the 1950s, so that by 1968 only 395,000 Jews remained, with new concentrations in the outlying Van Cortlandt and Riverdale areas.</p><p>From the 1920s Brooklyn became the borough most heavily populated by Jews as the number rose from 568,000 in 1918 to 797,000 in 1927. In contrast to Manhattan and the Bronx, Brooklyn tended to be a borough of well-defined neighborhood communities. Jewish religious life in Brooklyn apparently was more active than in other boroughs. While the older Jewish neighborhoods in the northern and western regions of Brooklyn began to lose their large Jewish populations by the 1930s, Jews were moving outward to form vast new communities in the central, southern, and eastern sectors. Thus, Williamsburg, across the East River from Manhattan, a community in which Jews numbered 140,000 in 1923, had only 33,400 Jews in 1957, though even as its population declined, it attained some celebrity as the home of a large Hasidic colony of post-World War ii immigrants from Hungary and <a class="interlinked" href="/history/historians-and-chronicles/historians-european/eastern-europe">Eastern Europe</a>. Bedford-Stuyvesant's 70,000 Jews in 1923 declined below 30,000 in 1957 and fell further in the 1960s as the area became a low-income African-American neighborhood. In 1925 about 250,000 Jews, or 82% of the population of the area, lived in East New York-New Lots-Brownsville. However, only 96,000 remained in 1957, and most of those left during the 1960s as Brownsville became predominantly black. On the other hand, in central Brooklyn the number of Jews in Boro Park increased from 46,000 in 1923 to 67,000 by 1950, in Bensonhurst from 45,000 in 1923 to 85,000 by 1950, and in Flatbush from 16,400 in 1923 to 123,000 by 1950. Sheepshead Bay in southern Brooklyn had 7,100 Jews in 1923 but 48,000, or 62% of the population, by 1950. Residential, middle-income Midwood-Marine Park grew from 3,200 Jews in 1923 to 64,000 by 1957. Jews settled early in the southern <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/coney-island">Coney Island</a>-Manhattan Beach area, which was nearly 70% Jewish in 1940 when 53,400 Jews resided there. From the 1930s Jews also began to settle the eastern Flatlands-Canarsie area, whose Jewish population rose from 4,400 in 1923 to 28,000, or 60% of the population, in 1957.</p><p>Altogether, the Jewish population of Brooklyn began to decrease, dropping from its heights of 975,000 in 1937 and 950,000 in 1950 to 760,000 in 1968. Thus Crown Heights, close to Bedford-Stuyvesant, dropped from over 75,000 in 1950 to 58,400 by 1957, and similar drops occurred after World War ii in Bensonhurst and Coney Island. The heavily Jewish East New York-New Lots area, in which 106,000 Jews lived in 1923, decreased to 74,000 Jews in 1950; it rose again, however, to 90,000 by 1957 with the construction of new housing on unoccupied land. Boro Park, long a center of Orthodox Judaism, became strongly Ḥasidic with an influx of Williamsburg Ḥasidim.</p><p>The borough of Queens saw a sustained increase in its middle-to upper-middle class Jewish population, owing to its newness, relative remoteness from the center of the city, and the rapid building of large apartment-house complexes like Lefrak City and other red-brick edifices constructed by Samuel J. LeFrak and his organization. While only 23,000 Jews lived there in 1918, the Jewish population grew to 200,000 by 1950 and 420,000 by 1968. Over 200,000 Jews moved there during the 1950s and large Jewish concentrations developed in Forest Hills-Rego Park, which had over 73,000 Jews, or 66% of the general population, by 1957; the Whitestone area, which had 24,000 Jews in 1957; Central Queens, in which 51,000 Jews lived in 1957; and Douglaston-Little Neck-Bellrose, which had 31,500 Jews in 1957. About 18,200 Jews lived in the Rockaways on the shore in 1923, and nearly 30,000 lived there by 1957.</p><p>About 5,000 Jews called the little-settled, isolated borough of Richmond (Staten Island) home in 1918, and that number increased moderately. In 1950 about 8,000 Jews lived there, but by 1968, after the construction of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/verrazano-narrows-bridge">Verrazano-Narrows Bridge</a> between the borough and Brooklyn, their number reached about 11,000.</p><p>The Jewish population of Manhattan declined from the 1920s. In 1937 there were 351,000 Jews on the island, while only 250,000 remained in 1968. Nevertheless, several neighborhoods increased. The number of Jews in well-to-do cosmopolitan sections of the West Side rose from 21,300 in 1923 to 71,000, or 29% of the general population, by 1957. Washington Heights, the uptown residential area, had 31,500 Jews in 1923 but nearly 70,000 by 1957. It was the center for German Jewish refugees of the 1930s. Nearly all Manhattan Jewish neighborhoods experienced declines in the 1960s, however, except the expensive, rebuilt Upper East Side, where Jews increased from 22,000 in 1940 to 42,000 in 1958.</p><p>The movement to the suburbs raised the Jewish population of rapidly built Nassau County, across the city boundary, from unknown but small numbers before 1940 to 329,000 in 1957 and 372,000 in 1963. Many families achieved the American dream of owning their own home by obtaining low interest loans offered to veterans of World War ii and by buying the low-price, mass-produced homes of William and Alfred Levitt, who created a vast Levittown (17,311 nearly identical homes built between 1947 and 1951) in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/long-island">Long Island</a>. Following already established city patterns, Jews tended to dwell together in suburban centers like Great Neck and Roslyn on the North Shore of Long Island and Woodmere, Cedarhurst, Lawrence, three of the Five Towns, and Baldwin and Hempstead on <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/south">the South</a> Shore. Beyond Nassau lay Suffolk County, in which the previously negligible Jewish population reached 12,000 in 1957 and 42,000 in 1963, with significant increases thereafter.</p><h3><a id="ECONOMIC_ACTIVITIES">economic activities</a></h3><p>New York Jewry formed so large a proportion of the city's population that Jewish economic habits and aptitudes broadly influenced the city's economy. Jewish labor in the garment industry, the city's foremost industry, reached its peak at about 1920. In 1921, production of men's apparel in New York City was valued at $326,832,000, and of women's, $759,628,000. The value of allied industries like knit goods, was put at $83,490,000. Perhaps 200,000 Jews belonged to the trade unions of the garment industry. From this point, the proportion of Jewish workers in the clothing industry steadily declined, until in the men's clothing branch it reached 39% in 1937; the new working group was largely composed of Italian women and, later, Puerto Ricans. The same process operated in the ladies' garment industry. One large local of the ilgwu was about three-quarters Jewish in the 1940s but declined to 44% in 1958. Jews remained in the garment industry in upper levels of skill as cutters and sample makers, and also as entrepreneurs and salesmen. The city, whose Garment Center epitomized the apparel business, provided the setting for the emergence of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/fashion-biographies/ralph-lauren">Ralph Lauren</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/fashion-biographies/calvin-klein">Calvin Klein</a>, Anne Klein, Arnold Scaasi (Isaacs backwards), <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/fashion-biographies/liz-claiborne">Liz Claiborne</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/fashion-biographies/donna-karan">Donna Karan</a>, among others, in the design and marketing of men's and women's clothing. One woman, Helena Rubinstein, virtually created the cosmetics industry. After World War i, she opened beauty salons around the country, selling pots of face creams and other products. She trained sales people to teach women skin care and devised a diet plan for beauty. An ardent supporter of Israel, she created the Helena Rubinstein Pavilion of Contemporary Art in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/asia/israeli-political-geography/tel-aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, and her foundation, created in 1953, provided funds to organizations concerned with health, medical research, and rehabilitation.</p><p>The Jewish labor movement in New York, after its heroic era of strike victories during the 1910s, was firmly established by 1920. The unions turned back attempts between 1920 and 1922 to reestablish the open shop. However, they were beset during the 1920s by violent factional quarrels with Communists. The latter derived support not only because of their tactical and propagandistic skill but also from post-World War i Jewish immigrants who entered the industry and felt somewhat excluded by the established union leadership and ideology. Communists secured control of the New York Joint Board and led it into a series of disastrous strikes culminating in 1926. The union was left in ruins and did not reestablish itself until the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/new-deal">New Deal</a> period. The Amalgamated was more fortunate, however, in maintaining its unity and power. A third garment union, the International Fur Workers' Union, succeeded in its trade-union objectives under Communist leadership, while the United Hat, Cap and Millinery Workers did likewise under liberal leaders.</p><p>During the 1920s the New York Jewish unions entered areas of activity never previously known to U.S. trade unions. They conducted large-scale <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/adult-education">adult education</a>, ran health clinics, owned a bank and summer resorts, built model urban housing, and generously subsidized struggling trade unions in such other industries as steel, coal, and textiles. Except for their Communist wing, they became pioneers of liberal political action, thus preparing a place for themselves in <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/new-deal">New Deal</a> political and legislative affairs.</p><p>The Jewish immigrant generation was heavily represented as workers – 23% "operatives and kindred" and 16% "craftsmen, foremen, and kindred" as late as 1950. The 32% who were "managers, officials, and proprietors" included a mass of shopkeepers and small businessmen. Jewish retailers were especially heavily represented in such areas as candy and stationery stores, grocery stores, hardware stores, haberdashery stores, tailor shops, and delicatessens and small restaurants. An incomplete estimate placed Jewish trade-union membership about 1928 at 134,000 of a total of 392,000 concentrated, in addition to needle and leather trades, in amusement and food preparation and distribution.</p><p>The immigrants' children, however, shifted towards sales and clerical occupations and independent business; in 1950, 55% of immigrants' sons were in these groups, and only 22% remained in traditional working-class occupations. One important channel of ascent was New York's excellent <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/public-school">public school</a> and college system. Jews constituted 51% of enrollment in the city's academic high schools in 1931, and 49.6% of the city's college and university students in 1935. As early as 1915 they were 85% of the student body in the city's unique free municipal college system, a percentage that probably did not decrease before 1960; others attended college outside the city. This higher education launched thousands of young Jews from poor or very modest circumstances into independent business and the professions. During the 1950s about 17% of New York Jews, including the older, immigrant group, were professionally employed.</p><p>Areas of Jewish economic activity often were clearly demarcated. Thus, the port of New York, shipping and other transportation, large banks and insurance companies, and heavy industry hardly employed any Jews. Even after the removal of discriminatory employment policies in 1945, there were few Jews in these industries. Small, independent businesses, the garment trade and light industry employed masses of Jews, and Jewish entrepreneurs could be found in those fields as well as in real estate, building, and investment banking. By the 1930s, over half the city's doctors, lawyers, dentists, and public school teachers were Jews, notwithstanding sharp anti-Jewish discrimination in certain universities and schools. After World War ii, Jews became strong components of the city's mercantile and professional class, heavily represented in academic, scientific, and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts/civil">civil service</a> organizations. Reflecting their occupational changes, they formed a large part of the membership and most of the leadership in unions of teachers and other public employees.</p><h3><a id="POLITICAL_AND_CIVIC_LIFE_1">political and civic life</a></h3><p>As the largest single ethnic group, Jews were a highly important factor in the political life of the city. Jews, who were about 27% of the city's population, were outnumbered only by the Irish-dominated Catholics, who were just over half. In no other city could Jews as a group weigh so heavily in politics, or were real or alleged Jewish political interests reckoned with so carefully. Until the 1930s the city was governed through the Manhattan organization of the Democratic Party, known as Tammany Hall, which held the support of most immigrants, including Jews. Jewish Republicans, conspicuous by their low numbers, pursued interests in civic reform, like Stanley M. Isaacs and Nathan Straus Jr., and the party's New York County leader, Samuel S. Koenig. In addition, Jews in East Harlem during the 1920s supported that district's dynamic U.S. Congressman, <a data-article="890851" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/la-guardia-fiorello-henry">Fiorello H. *La Guardia</a>, a rebel Republican. On the far left, Jews dominated the Socialists and Communists. Jews generally followed the Democratic Party, and some received the rewards of party loyalty – personal and business favors, municipal appointments, and judgeships.</p><p>The period from 1928 to 1945 witnessed far-reaching change. Jews had heavily supported Alfred E. Smith, a liberal Tammany reformer of Irish stock, in his successful campaigns for the governorship of the state and unsuccessful attempt for the presidency in 1928. The onset of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/great-depression">Great Depression</a> in 1929 brought New York Jewry overwhelmingly behind the New Deal and the Democratic Party. Support for <a data-article="329331" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/roosevelt-franklin-delanodeg">Franklin D. *Roosevelt</a> during his presidential campaigns of 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944 ran from 80% to 90%, higher than among any other group in the city. The urban liberalism of the New Deal had many of its seeds in the Jewish trade unions, East Side settlement houses, and among Jewish philanthropists and social workers. New York Jews were enthusiastic for the New Deal Democrat, <a data-article="358016" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lehman-herbert-henry">Herbert H. *Lehman</a>, elected to the governorship in 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938, and the German immigrant New Deal Senator, Robert F. Wagner. La Guardia, a Republican, gained the mayoralty of New York in 1933 by the votes of Italians, Jews, mostly of middle-class reform sympathies, and upper-class good-government supporters. Of Italian stock but partially Jewish in descent, and fluent in Yiddish, La Guardia's mastery of ethnic politics succeeded by 1937 in attracting the Jewish working class and left wing for his municipal version of the New Deal. During La Guardia's incumbency, from 1934 to 1946, Jews figured more prominently as city officials and political leaders. As fervent supporters simultaneously of the Protestant aristocrat Roosevelt, the Jewish banker Lehman, and the Italian commoner La Guardia, New York Jews preferred liberal, reform-minded candidates and avoided Republicans unless they significantly differed from the generally conservative habits of that party. The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/american-labor-party">American Labor Party</a> (founded in 1936) and the Liberal Party (organized in 1944), served their intended purpose of drawing voters of the left, especially Jews, to liberal or left-liberal candidates.</p><p>Following La Guardia's tenure, the major parties adopted a policy of "ethnic balance." They regarded it as necessary to nominate a Jew, Irishman, and Italian for the three city-wide electoral offices. Under the non-Jewish Democratic mayoralties from 1945 to 1966, Jews remained firmly and prominently Democratic. During most of this period, Jews were elected city-wide comptrollers (Lazarus Joseph, <a data-article="296636" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/beame-abraham-david">Abraham D. *Beame</a>), presidents of various boroughs (Abe Stark), and to the powerful position of county surrogates as well as other local judgeships. In 1965, the reigning Democrats for the first time nominated a Jew, Beame, for the mayoralty, but largely owing to a considerable Jewish defection to John V. Lindsay, the Republican reformer, Beame lost. As the number of blacks and Puerto Ricans in the city increased, Jewish and other white influence began to decline. But Jews, well-established, assimilated, and with money to finance political campaigns, continued to be major players.</p><p>Jews and other minorities suffered widespread discrimination by the hiring practices of banks, insurance companies, large corporations, law firms, and department stores, some of which were even owned by Jews. Several private universities and professional schools also imposed stringent admissions quotas against Jews and others, but the professional schools at the city's Catholic colleges enrolled a high proportion of Jews. Social discrimination against Jews, on the other hand, was so firmly fixed that even the most notable Jews could not belong to many of the city's leading business and social clubs, some of which their grandparents in fact had helped to found. Long-continued pressure, primarily from New York City and led by Jews, resulted in the passage of the state's Fair Employment Practice Act in 1945 prohibiting discrimination in employment. It was the first such law in the U.S.</p><p>After World War ii, as the Cold War gripped the nation, Jews in New York figured prominently in the signature event of that period. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife, and members of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-parties-and-movements/communist">Communist Party</a>, went on trial in 1951 for conspiracy to commit espionage, specifically for transmitting <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/military-affairs-nonnaval/nuclear-weapons">nuclear weapons</a> secrets to Russian agents. Largely based on testimony by David Greenglass, Ethel Rosenberg's brother, the couple were convicted and sentenced to death by Federal Judge Irving Kaufman. The assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case, Roy Cohn, stated in his autobiography that he had influenced the selection of the judge and had pressed him to impose the death penalty on both defendants. Kaufman held the Rosenbergs responsible not only for espionage but also for deaths in the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/asia-and-africa/korean-history/korean-war">Korean War</a>. The case became the center of controversy over communism in the United States, with supporters steadfastly maintaining that the convictions were an egregious example of persecution typical of the hysteria of those times. Some likened it to the witch hunts in Salem, a comparison that provided the inspiration for <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/arthur-miller">Arthur Miller</a>'s critically acclaimed play, <i>The Crucible</i>. Despite appeals on humanitarian grounds from Pope Pius xii and others, the Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair in 1953, both steadfastly maintaining their innocence. The case lingered in the public consciousness for decades, but in 1995, when decrypted Soviet communications became publicly available, the evidence indicated that <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/julius-rosenberg">Julius Rosenberg</a> was actively involved in espionage, but there was no evidence that he was involved in the specific charges against him or that his wife was involved at all.</p><p>Antisemitic organizations existed spasmodically in New York City. The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/ku-klux-klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> barely appeared during the 1920s. The pro-Nazi Friends of New Germany and its successor, the German-American Bund, were active from 1934 to 1941 against fierce Jewish and pro-democratic opposition. The same held true of the contemporary "Christian Front," led by Joseph E. McWilliams and Father Edward Lodge Curran, a leading propagandist, which was close to Father Charles E. Coughlin's antisemitic movement. It conducted antisemitic street meetings and fostered petty hooliganism. These groups collapsed during World War ii, following which organized antisemitism was virtually unknown for some 20 years. From about 1965 black militants, on the outer fringe of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/civil-rights">civil rights</a> movement, fostering and feeding upon black-Jewish frictions, helped stimulate the renewal of antisemitism. A climax was reached during the New York City teachers' strike of 1968, when some blacks made openly antisemitic remarks about the union and its leadership. The inclusion of antisemitic material at the same time in an exhibit on Harlem at the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/metropolitan-museum-art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> also proved highly provocative. Anti-Zionist statements from black militants and members of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-parties-and-movements/new-left">New Left</a> that emerged in the 1960s became difficult to distinguish from antisemitism. At the same time Jewish militants led by Rabbi <a data-article="874361" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/kahane-meir">Meir *Kahane</a> organized the Jewish Defense League, a vigilante "self-defense" group. Ironically, two young New York Jews, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, seeking to registers black voters in Mississippi, were killed in one of the watershed events of the civil rights struggle. It took decades for their killers to be brought to justice. Significantly, New York Jews were in the forefront in raising funds for civil rights causes across the country (see <a data-article="356567" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/black-jewish-relations-united-states">*Black-Jewish Relations</a> in the United States).</p><p>Between 1940 and 1965, New York's black population tripled as a great wave of migrants poured in from the South. Older black neighborhoods like Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant could not accommodate the newcomers, and blacks moved into adjoining areas like Ocean Hill-Brownsville, from which whites, including large numbers of Jews, promptly fled. In 1963 and 1964, at the height of the movement to integrate New York's public schools, Jews in Brooklyn and Queens joined with white Catholics to form Parents and Taxpayers, a militant antibusing organization that eventually had half a million members. The group, known as pat, staged massive demonstrations and even established a separate private academy. Its efforts were instrumental in the defeat of integration initiatives in the public school system. In response, black leaders sought to control their neighborhood schools. In 1967, the Board of Education began an experiment in community control of schools in the predominantly black Ocean Hill-Brownsville area, where residents elected a local board to run their schools. The local board soon clashed with the United Federation of Teachers over the extent of its personnel powers. The local board claimed the power to hire and fire teachers and administrators; the union argued that only the central board could do so.</p><p>In 1968 a junior high school science teacher, Fred Nauman, who was a chapter chairman of the 90%-white, majority Jewish, union, was fired. The action resulted in three citywide teacher strikes aimed at reinstating Nauman and nine counionists, who were also fired. The strikes lasted two months in all, affecting almost two million children, and they would be the most bitter in the city's modern history, full of charges of racism, union-busting, and antisemitism. The strikes pitted the city's white middle class, which backed the union, against the city's black poor and supporters of the community control idea. Mostly, the issues pitted blacks against whites, specifically blacks against Jews. The conflict exposed hidden fissures between the races. The strikes ended in mid-November 1968, substantially on the union's terms: the teachers were reinstated and the community control experiment was discontinued. But the controversy went beyond that. It helped to redefine the politics and culture of the city for decades. Outer-borough Jewish voters shifted to the right, moving closer to their white Catholic neighbors. The patrician mayor, John V. Lindsay, lost support in the wake of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, losing almost 60% of the Jewish vote, previously his strength. The city's next mayoral election, in 1973, produced its first Jewish mayor, Abraham D. Beame, elected with strong Jewish and Catholic votes.</p><p>The great growth of New York and its suburbs would not have been possible without <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/robert-moses">Robert Moses</a>, the master builder of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Although he never held elective office, Moses was probably the most powerful person in New York City government from the 1930s to the 1950s. He changed shorelines, built roadways, and transformed neighborhoods. His decisions favoring highways over public transport helped develop Brooklyn, Queens, and the suburbs of Long Island. Moses rose to power under Al Smith after catching the eye of the governor's top assistant, Belle Moskowitz. In several assigned tasks, Moses excelled, particularly the development of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/atlantic-ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> beaches, pools, and parks at Long Island's Jones Beach, a recreation area without peer that accommodated thousands year after year. After Franklin D. Roosevelt became president, Moses anticipated the availability of New Deal dollars and secured funding for a host of projects. At one point, one quarter of federal construction dollars was being spent in New York, and Moses had 80,000 people working under him. He built hundreds of parks and recreation facilities, but just one pool in Harlem. His highway projects on Long Island followed a circuitous path so as not to cross the properties of wealthy land owners, all the while he demolished numerous middle-class neighborhoods throughout New York City. During the Depression, Moses and La Guardia were responsible for the construction in the city of 10 large swimming pools; they could accommodate 66,000 swimmers. At one point Moses held 12 separate city and state titles. For the city he was parks commissioner, and for the state he was chairman of the Long Island Parks Commission and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/law/secretary-state">Secretary of State</a> as well as chairman of the New York State Power Commission, responsible for building hydroelectric dams. By doling out contracts and making deals, Moses built support from construction firms, insurance companies, labor unions, and real-estate developers. He used his influence to put projects on fast tracks, a tactic later repaid by legislators with funds for other projects. Moses controlled most public housing construction projects, but exercised vast power as chairman of the Triborough Bridge Authority. The bridge connects the Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens and the income earned from tolls helped Moses finance projects like the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, a vehicle link to Manhattan. After La Guardia's retirement, a series of mayors agreed to almost all of Moses' proposals. From the 1930s to the 1960s, Moses was responsible for the building of the Throgs Neck, Bronx-Whitestone, the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/henry-hudson">Henry Hudson</a> and the Verrazano Narrows bridges. His other projects included the Staten Island Expressway, the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the Belt Parkway, the Laurelton Parkway, and many more. In the 1960s, he was the mover behind Shea Stadium, home of the New York Mets baseball team, and <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/theater/lincoln-center-performing-arts">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a>. After a series of questionable decisions involving the 1964-65 World's Fair, Moses' power began to wane. His high-handedness and arrogance, depicted in Robert Caro's biography, <i>The Power Broker: <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/robert-moses">Robert Moses</a> and <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/fall">the Fall</a> of New York</i> (1974), which won the Pulitzer Prize, presented Moses with a different face.</p><h3><a id="COMMUNAL_RELIGIOUS_CULTURAL_AND_EDUCATIONAL_AFFAIRS">communal, religious, cultural, and educational affairs</a></h3><p>In the years after World War i, New York retained its unchallenged position as the center of U.S. Jewish life. After World War ii, the city became the capital of the entire Diaspora, as Zionist and other Jewish movements established their main offices in New York. The organizations sponsored rallies and mass meetings on behalf of overseas Jewry, sometimes attracting more than 100,000 people.</p><p>Jacob H. Schiff 's death in 1920, Judah L. Magnes' withdrawal about 1918, and his removal to Palestine in 1922 left as the most representative New York figures Louis Marshall (d. 1929), Felix M. Warburg (d. 1937), and Stephen S. Wise (d. 1949). The former two were distinctly "uptown" leaders, Marshall a lawyer and Warburg a banker-philanthropist. Wise, a Zionist and Reform rabbi, was closely linked with liberal political and religious movements and drew much of his strength as an urban populist spokesman for the mass of working and lower middle-class Jews. His personal stature and influence was the source of much of the influence of the <a data-article="303402" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/american-jewish-congress-ajcongress">*American Jewish Congress</a>, which he reestablished and headed from 1930 as a politically liberal, activist, pro-Zionist counterweight to the "uptown" bodies, the <a data-article="305063" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/american-jewish-committee-ajc">*American Jewish Committee</a> in particular. Much of the Congress' importance was lost with Wise's death and the softening of social and ideological differences after 1945. Moreover, the Committee eventually broadened its communal base and retracted the anti-Zionism it had adopted during the preceding decade. The ambitious attempt to coordinate communal life in the Kehillah ended by 1920, and by then New York Jewry had acculturated with much rapidity and formed a proportion of the city's ethnically and religiously diverse population.</p><p>Virtually every Jewish organization had chapters and members in the city, including <i>landsmanshaftn</i> and benefit societies, lodges, cultural bodies, charitable groups, political causes, Zionists, and synagogues, so that the total number of Jewish organizations probably exceeded 4,000 before the 1940s; with the disappearance of many lodges, benefit societies, and small immigrant synagogues there was probably a decrease thereafter. Altogether the city's Jews constituted an agglomeration of social classes, ideologies, clustered interests, and institutions, possessing Jewish identification in varying degrees of intensity.</p><p>Alongside vigorous local activity on behalf of such national or worldwide causes as Zionism, there were fairly distinct although overlapping spheres of interest. The Federation of Jewish Philanthropies served the poor and dependent. All of the federation-affiliated hospitals and many other institutions associated with it were nonsectarian. The federation's original 54 affiliates numbered 130 by 1968, and included: hospitals, institutions for the aged and chronically ill, casework agencies, summer camps, Young Men's and Women's Hebrew Associations and neighborhood centers, and the Jewish Education Committee. Affiliates also received funds from patient and client fees, the Greater New York Fund, government assistance, and direct contributions and endowments. Service to the increasing number of aged and to troubled families (through the Jewish Family Service, successor to the United Hebrew Charities), and recreation and informal education for middle-class youth and adults slowly replaced the earlier relief services. The Jewish hospitals, some of which were rated among the world's finest, totaled about 7,000 beds in 1968. They included Mount Sinai, Montefiore, Joint Diseases (orthopedic), Brooklyn Jewish, Long Island Jewish, Jewish Hospital for Chronic Diseases, Beth El (renamed Brookdale), Beth Israel, Maimonides, Bronx-Lebanon, Hillside, and Jewish Memorial. In addition, Jacobi Hospital, a municipal hospital, was attached to <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/yeshiva-university">Yeshiva University</a>'s <a class="interlinked" href="/people/science-and-technology/physics-biographies/albert-einstein">Albert Einstein</a> Medical School, and Mount Sinai Hospital opened a medical school in 1968 as a unit of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/city-university-new-york">City University of New York</a>.</p><p>Life centered on Yiddish institutions typified by the daily <i>Forward</i>, the Workmen's Circle, Yiddish cultural societies and schools, the <a data-article="655437" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jewish-labor-committee">*Jewish Labor Committee</a> after 1934, and the scholarly institution, <a data-article="398109" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/yivo">*yivo</a>, held on, tenuously. Perhaps the foremost writer in Yiddish of that period was <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/hebrew-literature-biographies/isaac-bashevis-singer">Isaac Bashevis Singer</a>, who emigrated from his native Poland to New York in 1935 and who continued to write in the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/language-and-linguistics/mother-tongue">mother tongue</a> for <i>The Forward</i> before achieving widespread recognition in English translation (and the <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/physics/science-general/nobel-prize">Nobel Prize</a> in literature in 1978). The early associations with Jewish trade unionism lessened as Yiddish secularism became a cultural and fraternal middle-class movement. Hebraists, centered in the <a data-article="294965" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/histadrut">*Histadrut Ivrith</a> and the weekly <i>Hadoar</i>, and closely tied to Zionist and educational affairs, had a smaller group of adherents. Composed largely of writers, Hebrew teachers, and rabbis, the Hebrew group shrank as the reality of Hebrew in Israel took hold.</p><p>Religion played a major role in daily life, especially for the Orthodox. In several neighborhoods, particularly Boro Park, Crown Heights, Williamsburg, and sections of Flatbush in Brooklyn, as well as the Lower East Side even in its decline, Sabbaths and Jewish holidays provided an opportunity for Jews to assert their identity. Orthodox synagogues were full, stores in heavily Orthodox areas were shut, even those owned by non-Jews, and sectors of the garment and diamond industries regularly closed. The commerce and industry of the city came near a standstill on Rosh Ha-Shanah and <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/judaism/judaism/yom-kippur">Yom Kippur</a>. Beginning in the 1960s the public schools closed on those days because Jews, who formed a majority of the teaching staff, absented themselves.</p><p>In 1967 there were 539 Orthodox, 184 Conservative, 93 Reform, and five unclassified synagogues known in Greater New York; all but 163 of the total were within the city's boundaries. Actual synagogue affiliation tended to be low, however. A study of Brooklyn suggested that merely one-quarter of its Jews belonged to synagogues in 1945–46, a proportion that probably differed little in other boroughs.</p><p>The Reform movement, using a good deal of English in the prayer book, liberal in social outlook, and generally wealthier than the immigrant community, attracted regular worshipers to its major temples, some of which were monumental or historic. Temple Emanu-El continued to be foremost because of its size, wealth, and prestige, and occupied a splendid edifice at Fifth Avenue and 65<sup>th</sup> Street from 1929. Other major congregations included the Central Synagogue (whose building at Lexington Avenue and 55<sup>th</sup> Street dated to 1870), the Free Synagogue, Rodeph Shalom, Shaarey Tefilah (West End Synagogue until its transfer from the West Side to the East Side of Manhattan in 1959), Union Temple and Beth Elohim in Brooklyn, and Central Synagogue in Rockville Centre (Nassau County). The older congregations did not share much in the movement within Reform toward more traditional worship. But many Reform Jews became active philanthropists. From the 1950s there was a gradual shift in the Reform movement toward liberal social and political action as a major goal, but there were objections and Temple Emanu-El left the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in protest at this direction. The foremost Reform rabbi was Stephen S. Wise, who in 1922 founded the Hebraic and Zionist-oriented Jewish Institute of Religion (jir), which opened in 1925. Although the jir intended to train rabbis for all denominations, most of its graduates went to Reform congregations. The notable early faculty included Salo W. Baron, R. Marcus, H. Slonimsky, S. Spiegel, C. Tchernowitz, and others, but the school declined after its first decade. Other New York Reform rabbinic notables included Samuel Schulman, Jonah B. Wise, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/spanish-and-portuguese-history-biographies/louis-i">Louis I</a>. Newman, Bernard J. Bamberger, Samuel H. Goldenson, Julius Mark, Charles E. Shulman, and Edward E. Klein.</p><p>By the 1940s Orthodoxy in New York lost its intimate association with immigrant life, and tended to be divided internally between modernists oriented to the problems of Orthodox Judaism in a secular, scientific, urban society, and others indifferent or hostile to such concerns. The latter stressed piety, study, and aloofness from non-Orthodox Judaism. The modernist trend included such congregations as Kehillath Jeshurun, The Jewish Center, Fifth Avenue Synagogue, Riverdale Jewish Center, and such rabbis as Leo Jung, Emanuel Rackman, Joseph H. Lookstein, Simon G. Kramer, Walter S. Wurzberger, and Irving Greenberg. The "pietist" group was led mainly from yeshivot and was augmented by Ḥasidic immigration from the 1940s. Special Orthodox segments were the S.R. Hirsch school of German Orthodoxy, transplanted in 1938–40 to upper Manhattan under the leadership of Rabbi Joseph Breuer, and Sephardi congregations, largely in Brooklyn, composed of contemporary immigrants from Turkey, Greece, Syria, and Iraq. The venerable Shearith Israel continued under the ministry of H.P. Mendes, D. de Sola Pool, and L.C. Gerstein. The common institutional effort of Orthodox Jewry was the promotion of yeshivot, whose enrollment multiplied from below 2,000 in 1920 to approximately 5,000 in 1935, 8,000 in 1945, and 45,000 in 1968. Yeshiva College became <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/yeshiva-university">Yeshiva University</a> in 1943 under the leadership of Samuel Belkin, and expanded to include several high schools, the college, graduate and professional schools, and a medical school. Its yeshivah brought notable rabbinic scholars from Europe to serve as principal <i>rashei yeshivah</i>, the first two being Rabbis S.H. Polacheck and Moses Soloveichik; Joseph B. Soloveichik later succeeded his father. Other notable Orthodox yeshivah scholars and talmudists were Rabbis Joseph E. Henkin, Moses Feinstein, Jacob Kamenetsky, Moses A. Shatzkes, and Aaron Kotler.</p><p>The city's Conservative congregations leaned close to Orthodoxy, in which most of their members had been raised. The Jewish Theological Seminary was the focal institution of the Conservatives, and exercised broad spiritual influence. Partly owing to the influence of Mordecai M. Kaplan, Conservative synagogues also served as community centers, offering social, cultural, and recreational activities. The Jewish Center and the West Side Institutional Synagogue in Manhattan, both Orthodox although founded by Kaplan, began the trend. The Society for the Advancement of Judaism (Reconstructionist), B'nai Jeshurun, and Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan and the Brooklyn Jewish Center, Flatbush Jewish Center, and East Midwood Jewish Center in Brooklyn replicated this approach, which was continued in many large newer synagogues in Queens and the suburbs. The Conservative growth was greatest in Queens and the new suburban towns, where 145 of their 184 synagogues were situated in 1967. Rabbinic leaders, besides Kaplan, included Israel Goldstein, Max Drob, Israel H. Levinthal, Harry Halpern (d. 1981), Robert Gordis, Ben Zion Bokser, Milton Steinberg, William Berkowitz, and Judah Nadich.</p><p>The Jewish Division of the New York Public Library and the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary (damaged by fire in 1966) were two of the six or seven leading Jewish libraries in the world. No other city of the Diaspora offered such an abundance of Jewish scholars, books and manuscripts, and varied opportunities for study in a communal milieu that was profoundly Jewish.</p><p>The city was home to one of the greatest educational achievements of modern times, and it had a lasting effect on the individuals, the city, and the nation. Four colleges, City College and Hunter in Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens Colleges, offered free tuition to qualified students. In the years when top-flight private schools were restricted to the children of the Protestant Establishment, thousands of indigent but brilliant Jewish New Yorkers attended the colleges. For struggling immigrants and their offspring, this proved an unparalleled opportunity to gain a first-rank education, prepare for life's challenges, and to broaden skills. Building on the accomplishments of earlier graduates like Bernard Baruch in finance and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/supreme-court-biographies/felix-frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a> in law, the colleges prepared students in the sciences, government, economics, education, <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts-53">political science</a>, and the law. Beginning with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/julius-axelrod">Julius Axelrod</a>, of the class of 1933, City College nurtured nine <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/physics/science-general/nobel-prize">Nobel Prize</a> winners, all of them Jewish, in economics, chemistry, physics and medicine, a figure unmatched by any public institution in the United States. All nine obtained their undergraduate degrees between 1933 and 1950. Across a wide path, the colleges educated such nationally recognized figures as <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-biographies/daniel-bell">Daniel Bell</a> in sociology, Nathan Glazer and Irving Kristol in politics, Ira Gershwin, the lyricist, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/bernard-malamud">Bernard Malamud</a>, the writer, Stanley Kaplan, founder of Kaplan Educational Services, the actors Edward G. Robinson, Judd Hirsch, Zero Mostel, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/eli-wallach">Eli Wallach</a> and Richard Schiff, and business and technology giants like Andrew Grove of Intel. Graduates of the city colleges rose to prominent positions on Wall Street as teachers, administrators, union officials, journalists, accountants, etc., becoming the backbone of the educational system, the economy, and society in general, all for the cost of subway fare. During the 1930s and through the 1950s, the colleges were bastions of free debate, with roiling political discussions over hot topics like communism vs. socialism and Trotskyites vs. Bolsheviks dominating campus activities. In the last years of the 1930s, as fascism threatened to dominate Spain, a contingent of New Yorkers (many of them leftist Jews recruited from the college campuses) made up the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/abraham-lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> Brigade and set off for Spain to "save" the country from Generalissimo <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/spanish-and-portuguese-history-biographies/francisco-franco">Francisco Franco</a>. These idealists, whose cause was dominated by Communists and other left-wingers, proved unsuccessful. In the late 1960s, black and Puerto Rican activists and their white allies demanded that the City University colleges implement an aggressive <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/affirmative-action">affirmative action</a> program. The administration came up with an open-admissions plan under which any graduate of a New York City high school could matriculate at one of the 20 colleges in the system. But that program came at a high cost, as the colleges' academic standing declined (along with the number of Jews, now more affluent and able to afford private, out-of-town schools).</p><p>Still another important achievement in higher education involved the founding of the University in Exile at the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/new-school-social-research">New School for Social Research</a>. From 1933 until the end of World War ii, the University in Exile served as a base for scholars who had been dismissed from teaching and government positions by totalitarian regimes in Europe. The university later became the New School's Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Sciences, providing an academic base for notable scholars like the psychologists <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/psychology-and-psychiatry-biographies/max-wertheimer">Max Wertheimer</a> and Aron Gurwitsch and the political philosophers <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-biographies/hannah-arendt">Hannah Arendt</a> and Leo Straus.</p><p>New York provided the launching pad for the nation's feminist movement, beginning with the publication of Betty Friedan's <i>Feminine Mystique</i> in 1963. At the time a suburban New York housewife, Friedan analyzed "the problem that has no name," as she called it, based on interviews with women unhappy with their lot as housewives, babysitters, cooks and laundresses, and with limited career prospects. The book struck a nerve, providing the intellectual basis for the feminist movement. It permanently transformed the social fabric and consciousness of American society. Friedan was joined by more than two dozen women, including <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing-biographies/gloria-steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>, in founding the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/national-organization-women">National Organization for Women</a>, and was its first president, serving from 1966 to 1970. The two Jewish women became the best-known figures in the feminist movement in the United States. Friedan's death in 2006 reminded generations of women of the debt they owed to the founding mother of feminism, who campaigned tirelessly for equal treatment of women in the workplace and in all areas of public and private life.</p><h3><a id="CULTURE_1">culture</a></h3><p>The half-century following the end of World War i witnessed the entry of Jews in large numbers into every corner of New York artistic and cultural life. Since this period also marked the growing domination by New York City of U.S. cultural life in general, and in some areas, such as theater, music, and publishing, its virtual monopolization, New York Jews prominent in these fields found themselves automatically at the center of national attention. The role of New York Jews as consumers of the arts also grew immensely. From the 1920s on, Jews formed a disproportionately high percentage of New York's theatergoers, music listeners, book purchasers, and art collectors. (One rough estimate placed Jews at 70% of the city's concert and theater audience during the 1950s.) Similarly, Jews also emerged in these years as major patrons of the arts. After World War ii, particularly, they played a prominent part in endowing and supporting local cultural and artistic institutions.</p><p>In literature many Jewish writers of the 1920s and especially of the Depression years of the 1930s drew on their backgrounds in the immigrant communities to write memorable novels, essays, poetry, and short stories in the realms of social realism and "proletarian fiction." Left-wing Jewish intellectuals like <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy-biographies/sidney-hook">Sidney Hook</a>, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Philip Rahv, and Michael Gold wrote for <i>The Nation, The New Masses, The New Leader</i>, and <i>Partisan Review</i>. Some of the best descriptions ever written of New York life in the early and mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, especially of its immigrant neighborhoods, can be found in books like: Samuel Ornitz' <i>Haunch, Paunch and Jowl</i> (1925), Henry Roth's <i>Call It Sleep</i> (1934), Michael Gold's <i>Jews Without Money</i> (1930), Alfred Kazin's <i>On Native Grounds</i> (1942) and <i>A Walker in the City</i> (1951), <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/bernard-malamud">Bernard Malamud</a>'s <i>The Assistant</i> (1957), <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/paul-goodman">Paul Goodman</a>'s <i>The Empire City</i> (1959), and the novels of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/joseph-heller">Joseph Heller</a> and Wallace Markfield (see <a data-article="360901" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/united-states-literature">*United States Literature</a>, Jews in).</p><p>The poetry of Louis Zukofsky was suffused with the atmosphere of New York life, while Kenneth Koch was a leader of the school of "New York poets" in the 1960s. In the years after World War ii, the 92<sup>nd</sup> St. ymha served as a center for readings of modern American poetry and for the introduction to a wide public of a number of young contemporary poets. Perhaps no poet commanded the attention of the general public as did <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/allen-ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> (d. 1997), who created a storm with his first published work, <i>Howl</i> (1956), a long poem about consumer society's negative human values. "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness" was the opening line, and Ginsberg, a homosexual and leader of the Beat generation, drew on <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/walt-whitman">Walt Whitman</a> and others for inspiration. He famously wrote about his relationship with his mentally disturbed mother in <i>Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg</i> (1961).</p><p>The Broadway musical theater and the world of popular music from the late 1920s through the 1960s were dominated by Jewish composers and librettists: <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/irving-berlin">Irving Berlin</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/george-gershwin">George Gershwin</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/jerome-kern">Jerome Kern</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/harold-arlen">Harold Arlen</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/frank-loesser">Frank Loesser</a>, E.Y. (Yip) Harburg, and the teams of Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and Lerner and Loewe. Many entertainers got their start in vaudeville, including <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/theater-biographies/al-jolson">Al Jolson</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/theater-biographies/eddie-cantor">Eddie Cantor</a>, the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/marx-brothers">Marx Brothers</a>, George Jessel, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/theater-biographies/fanny-brice">Fanny Brice</a> and Sophie Tucker, and then transferred their talents to radio, the movies and television. Brooklyn-born <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/barbra-streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> attained fame on Broadway as a singer and actress before becoming a Hollywood star and director. The leading Broadway playwrights of the 1930s and 1940s, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/lillian-hellman">Lillian Hellman</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/clifford-odets">Clifford Odets</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/elmer-rice">Elmer Rice</a>, achieved renown with their searing, realistic dramas, while George S. Kaufman, Abe Burrows, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/moss-hart">Moss Hart</a>, among others, lightened the stage with bon mots and witty comedies. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/arthur-miller">Arthur Miller</a>'s <i>Death of a Salesman</i> (1949) won recognition as the best drama produced on the American stage in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. A series of popular comedies by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/neil-simon">Neil Simon</a>, beginning with <i>The Odd Couple</i> (1968), achieved critical and popular success. In 1931, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/theater-biographies/lee-strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a> co-founded the Group Theater, a company that spawned such theatrical legends as John Garfield and Stella Adler, and in 1949 Strasberg started the Actor's Studio, where <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/paul-newman">Paul Newman</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/dustin-hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/eli-wallach">Eli Wallach</a> trained. During this period, all the major Broadway theaters were owned and controlled by members and descendants of the Shubert family, which earned fees for the use of the theaters and sometimes became involved in producing the shows. Although others owned some Broadway theaters, the Shubert organization, by the 1970s, owned half of all the houses. Beginning in the mid-1960s Joseph Papp promoted the idea of offering free performances of Shakespeare in the parks of New York. His long campaign led to the founding of the Public Theater, supported by commercial Broadway productions like <i>A Chorus Line</i>. The Shakespeare performances continued well into the 21<sup>st</sup> century with major actors taking on classic roles in Central Park. David Merrick dominated the Broadway stage, producing successful musicals and straight plays for more than 20 years. Sol Hurok, who began his career organizing local Jewish productions in Brooklyn's Brownsville, developed into the leading musical impresario in the U.S. The avant-garde Off Broadway theater came into its own in the 1960s and provided venues for talented writers and actors. The Living Theater of Julian Beck and Judith Malina and the Open Theater of Joseph Chaikin staged a variety of provocative productions.</p><p>Indicative of the impact of Jewish audiences on the New York theater was the fact that a number of Broadway hits of the 1950s and 1960s were on Jewish themes, the most successful of all being the musical <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>. Set in the fictional <i>shtetl</i> of Anatevka, the musical drew on the short stories of Shalom Aleichem about Tevye the dairyman. Zero Mostel's over-the-top portrayal of the central character became the talk of the town. The musical, written by Joseph Stein, and the music, by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock, dominated the airwaves and graced stages around the world as it offered a universal message about family life in troubled times. A young Stephen Sondheim began his career as a composer by writing the lyrics for the smash <i><a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/film-and-television/west-side-story">West Side Story</a></i> (1957), which had a book by Arthur Laurents, music by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/leonard-bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, and was produced, choreographed, and directed by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/dance-biographies/jerome-robbins">Jerome Robbins</a>. The plot borrowed liberally from Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and became a staple of the musical repertory. After the 1920s, the Yiddish theater in New York lost much of its vitality. In 1928 there were at least 11 Yiddish theaters, giving hundreds of performances a month, but the number dwindled to a mere handful and only occasional productions by the 1960s.</p><p>The New York musical world, both classical and popular, served as a showcase for a host of Jewish talent. Jews, who made up 70% of the membership of the musicians' union, Local 801 from the 1930s on, held most of the important instrumentalist chairs of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and the National Broadcasting Company Symphony Orchestra, which was led by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/arturo-toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> during its heyday. The leading musical performers included the conductors Artur Rodzinski, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/bruno-walter">Bruno Walter</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/lukas-foss">Lukas Foss</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/leonard-bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>; the opera singers <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/richard-tucker">Richard Tucker</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/robert-merrill">Robert Merrill</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/jan-peerce">Jan Peerce</a>, Roberta Peters, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/beverly-sills">Beverly Sills</a>, and Friedrich Schorr; the pianist <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/vladimir-horowitz">Vladimir Horowitz</a> and the violinist <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/isaac-stern">Isaac Stern</a>. In the 1960s, with the assistance of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Stern led a successful drive to save Carnegie Hall, one of the greatest musical venues in the world. Their effort preserved the New York landmark, which had one of the clarion sounds in the world of music. Although <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/benny-goodman">Benny Goodman</a>, one of the most important jazz clarinetists, was born in Chicago, it was in New York that he came to prominence. In 1938, Goodman and his group of swing musicians were booked to play in Carnegie Hall, then a citadel of upper-crust society and "high-class" music. Carnegie Hall had a seating capacity of 2,760 and Goodman's concert had been sold out for weeks. The concert started off on a polite, though tepid note. But when the group tore into <i><a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/sing-sing">Sing Sing</a> Sing</i>, an energetic, rhythmic and bouncy tune, the audience responded with deafening applause. That concert came to be regarded as the most significant in jazz history, proving that jazz could be accepted by mainstream audiences. Goodman was also responsible for a significant step in racial integration in the United States. In the early 1930s, black and white jazz musicians could not play together in most clubs or concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/jim-crow-laws">Jim Crow laws</a>. Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him and the drummer Gene Krupa in the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/benny-goodman">Benny Goodman</a> Trio. In 1936 he added the black <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/lionel-hampton">Lionel Hampton</a> on vibes to form the Benny Goodman Quartet.</p><p>The financier Otto Kahn was a leading financial backer of the Metropolitan Opera in the 1920s and 1930s, while Morton Baum helped found the City Center for Music and Dance and was instrumental in the establishment of <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/theater/lincoln-center-performing-arts">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a>. One of the premier American classical composers, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/aaron-copland">Aaron Copland</a>, got his start in Brooklyn. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/dance-biographies/lincoln-kirstein">Lincoln Kirstein</a> paired with the genius of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/dance-biographies/george-balanchine">George Balanchine</a>, a non-Jew, to shape 20<sup>th</sup>-century dance. Kirstein thought of the idea of the New York City Ballet, which became one of the foremost dance companies in the world. It was solely responsible for training its own artists and creating its own works. The company had 90 dancers, making it the largest dance organization in the United States and into the 21<sup>st</sup> century had an active repertory of more than 150 works, many choreographed by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/dance-biographies/jerome-robbins">Jerome Robbins</a>, who created serious dance works as well as choreography for the Broadway theater.</p><p>In the early 1960s, a young singer-songwriter from Hibbing, Minn., drifted into <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/greenwich-village">Greenwich Village</a> and changed the nature of popular music. Originally Robert Zimmerman, he took the name <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/bob-dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and performed his own compositions of story songs that quickly gained notice for their fierce political nature and their poetry. His "Blowin' in the Wind," about the changes looming on the American landscape, became one of the anthems of the civil rights movement as well as for the anti-Establishment postcollege generation in the wake of opposition to the war in Vietnam. Dylan's whining delivery of his protest songs, and his adoption of acoustic techniques, also influenced generations of musicians. In the late 1960s, following Dylan's success, the team of Simon and Garfunkel, songwriters and performers from Queens, achieved enduring popularity after their music ("Mrs. Robinson," "The Sound of Silence") was featured in the movie <i>The Graduate,</i> directed by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/mike-nichols">Mike Nichols</a>.</p><p>In painting, the Soyer brothers – Raphael, Moses, and Isaac – and Chaim Gross were prominent in the social-realistic art movement that flourished in Greenwich Village in the 1920s. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/ben-shahn">Ben Shahn</a> and Jack Levine were among the many Jewish artists whose early careers were associated with the art programs of the Works Projects Administration during the Depression years. The Nazi persecution brought to New York a number of German expressionist painters, including <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-biographies/max-weber">Max Weber</a>. Prominent in the "New York School" of abstract expressionists and other movements that developed after World War ii were Franz Klein, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/larry-rivers">Larry Rivers</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/louise-nevelson">Louise Nevelson</a> and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/mark-rothko">Mark Rothko</a>. In the 1960s, the Jewish Museum diverged from its tradition of exhibiting Jewish art only to sponsor a number of important avant-garde shows of sculpture and art. The far-flung and diverse Guggenheim family played a major role as patrons. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/peggy-guggenheim">Peggy Guggenheim</a> moved her gallery from Europe to New York during the war years and her uncle, Solomon Guggenheim, endowed a new building for the Guggenheim <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/museum-modern-art">Museum of Modern Art</a> on upper Fifth Avenue. The only building in New York designed by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/frank-lloyd-wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, it opened in 1960 and quickly became one of the architectural landmarks of the city, if not the nation. In 1969 Robert Lehman's world-renowned collection of impressionist and post-impressionist painting was willed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York was the home, and the canvas, for a slew of important photographers: <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/photography-biographies/richard-avedon">Richard Avedon</a> (fashion), Helen Levitt (street life), Weegee (crime), and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/photography-biographies/diane-arbus">Diane Arbus</a> (people on the fringes of society). <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/richard-meier">Richard Meier</a>, Paul Rudolph, Robert A.M. Stern, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/gordon-bunshaft">Gordon Bunshaft</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/marcel-breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>, and Frank Gehry cut their architectural teeth in New York during this period.</p><p>In wevd, established by the <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i> in 1931 and named with the initials of the socialist Eugene V. Debs, New York boasted the world's only full-time Yiddish radio station, though by 1970 much of its programming had gone over to English. Gertrude Berg, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/theater-biographies/fanny-brice">Fanny Brice</a>, Morey Amsterdam, Walter Winchell, and Barry Gray, New York radio personalities, became household names. Berg wrote and starred in <i>The Goldbergs</i>, a series about Jewish life in the Bronx. From the show's opening – "Yoo hoo, Mrs. Goldberg!" – listeners got a brace of Jewish New York, complete with mannerisms and Yiddish. The series transferred successfully to television. An entire school of television comedy, often deriving from the comic routines of the "Borscht Belt" (see <a data-article="356739" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/new-york-state">*New York State</a>), gave professional life to performers like Sam Levenson, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/sid-caesar">Sid Caesar</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/jerry-lewis">Jerry Lewis</a>. But it was <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/milton-berle">Milton Berle</a>, with his Tuesday night variety show, who almost single-handedly changed the nation's evening habits. Television was in its infancy when Berle, broadcasting from New York, wowed audiences week after week, interrupting acts, dressing in drag and participating in skit after skit. Audiences found him outrageously amusing and flocked to buy their own television sets, millions of them in the postwar years. Berle, or Uncle Miltie as he called himself, was known as Mr. Television. The National Broadcasting Company signed him to a 30-year contract, and Berle, who started in show business at the age of 4, continued to perform into his 90s.</p><p>Thanks to television, a "new breed" of comedian found favor with more sophisticated audiences. They were social commentators and satirists of common situations. Their styles varied widely, from the comedy sparring of the team of Nichols and May to the storytelling of Alan King to the obscenity spewing <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/lenny-bruce">Lenny Bruce</a> to the kvetching of the stage milquetoast <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/woody-allen">Woody Allen</a> to the angst of Shelley Berman. Jewish humor, in cabarets, nightclubs, on television, and in the movies, found a broad American audience.</p><p>At that time, the three major commercial television networks, the Columbia Broadcasting System (<a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/protestant-christianity-biographies/william-paley">William Paley</a>), the National Broadcasting Company (David and Robert Sarnoff), and the American Broadcasting Company (Leonard Goldenson), were run by Jews.</p><p>From the 1920s on, Jews played a prominent role in the New York publishing business, among them Horace Liveright of Liveright &amp; Boni. B.W. Huebsch and Harold Guinzberg of Viking Press, Henry Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster of Simon &amp; Schuster, Alfred Knopf of Alfred A. Knopf, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/bennett-cerf">Bennett Cerf</a> of Random House, Roger Straus of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, and Jason Epstein of Anchor Books. The German-Jewish house of Schocken Books moved to New York City in 1946. Bloch Publishing Co., Thomas Yoseloff, and Abelard &amp; Schumann put out a largely or wholly Jewish line. Brooklyn was the launching pad for the literary career of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/norman-mailer">Norman Mailer</a>, who wrote the signature book of World War ii, <i>The Naked and the Dead</i>. Irwin Shaw, a prolific writer of short stories, got his start in Brooklyn as well. And beginning in 1955, New York was home to <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/judaism-biographies/elie-wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a>, the memoirist of the Holocaust and campaigner for <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/international-law/human-rights">human rights</a>, who settled in the city after his liberation from Buchenwald. Wiesel wrote most of his more than 40 published works in the city.</p><p>In journalism, the unparalleled international coverage and national reporting of <i><a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/new-york-times">The New York Times</a></i>, under the patronage of the Ochs and Sulzberger families, won widespread respect, proven in 90 <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing/journalism-and-publishing/pulitzer-prizes">Pulitzer Prizes</a> and other recognized awards. Its publisher throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, was a staunch anti-Zionist who opposed the creation of the State of Israel. He saw Judaism as a religion only and he had a series of disputes with the leading American Jewish organizations over the newspaper's coverage. Particularly galling, in retrospect, was <i>The Times'</i> coverage of the Holocaust and Hitler's campaign against the Jews, which received limited space in the "paper of record." After the 1956 war in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/asia/middle-eastern-physical-geography/middle-east">Middle East</a>, the newspaper's coverage of Israel got serious attention and its reports competed for space with all other news developments. <i>The New York Post</i> during the 1940s and into the 1960s, under the ownership of Dorothy Schiff, a descendant of Jacob Schiff, and the editorship of James Wechsler, gave voice to liberal and underdog causes while walking a financial tightrope. Numerous reporters came to prominence during World War ii, the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/asia-and-africa/korean-history/korean-war">Korean War</a>, and the war in Vietnam, including <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing-biographies/david-halberstam">David Halberstam</a>, Meyer Berger (<i>About New York</i>), Bernard Kalb and his brother Marvin Kalb, A.M. Rosenthal (<i>There Is No News From Auschwitz</i>, he famously wrote in <i>The Times</i> in 1958), Joseph Lelyveld, the son of a rabbi, and Max Frankel, a Holocaust survivor. The Yiddish press flourished despite declining circulations in the 1920s and 1930s, but lost ground steadily in the years after World War ii. Three New York periodicals with nation-wide audiences were also under Jewish ownership or editorship: <i>The New Yorker, The Village Voice</i>, and the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. <a data-article="350439" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/commentary"><i>*Commentary</i></a> and <i>Midstream</i>, published under the auspices of Jewish organizations, had influential readerships (see <a data-article="331139" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/press">*Press</a>, Jewish, in U.S.A.). The Newhouse family played a major role in publishing as owners of newspapers and a plethora of national magazines, based in New York.</p><p>After World War i, Jews took a greater interest in popular sports, both as spectators and as performers. Hank Greenberg, a product of the Bronx, achieved renown as a home-run slugger (58 in one season) at a time when there were few Jews in major league baseball. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/sports-and-games/sports-biographies/sandy-koufax">Sandy Koufax</a>, one of baseball's greatest pitchers, pointedly refused to pitch a World Series game on <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/judaism/judaism/yom-kippur">Yom Kippur</a>. Although he was not observant, Koufax said he felt he had to be a role model. Among other well-known New York athletes were the boxers Benny Leonard and Barney Ross, the baseball players Harry Danning, Sid Gordon, and Cal Abrams, the football quarterback Sid Luckman, and the basketball star and coach Nat Holman. One of the signature events in sports occurred during Holman's tenure at City College, which fielded a basketball team assembled from the regular student body, not players recruited for their athletic ability. In the 1950–51 season, City College, known as the "Cinderella team," won the two most important basketball titles of the time, the National Invitational Tournament and the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship. But the celebrations were short-lived when it was disclosed that certain players on the team had "shaved" points, or played to reduce their margin of victory, at the behest of gamblers. It was a watershed moment in basketball, in the lives of the players, Jewish and non-Jewish, some of whom went to prison, and the college, which was forced to de-emphasize basketball.</p><p>(For biographies of the figures mentioned above, see individual entries.)</p><p>Jewish involvement in New York cultural life in the middle decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century was so complete that it had an impact on local speech, gestures, food, humor, and attitudes. It is doubtful if anywhere else in the history of the Diaspora such a large Jewish community existed in so harmonious a symbiosis with a great metropolis, without either isolating itself from its surroundings or losing its own distinct sense of character and identity. If the Jews gave to New York unstintingly of their experience, energies, and talents, they received in return an education in urbanity and a degree of cosmopolitan sophistication unknown to any other Jewish community of similar size in the past. When 20<sup>th</sup>-century New York Jews thought of the city they lived in, they did not simply consider it a great capital of civilization that had generously taken them in; rather, they thought of themselves as joint builders of this greatness and one of its main continuing supports. Such a relationship marks a unique moment in Jewish history, and one that, given current cultural and demographic trends in the United States and the world at large, is not likely to recur again.</p><p>[Lloyd P. Gartner,</p><p>Hillel Halkin,</p><p>Edward L. Greenstein, and</p><p>Yehuda Ben-Dror /</p><p>James Marshall (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h2><a id="_1970-2006">1970–2006</a></h2><h3><a id="DEMOGRAPHY_2">demography</a></h3><p>At the center of international finance, politics, entertainment, and culture, with a nearly unrivaled collection of museums, galleries, performance venues, media outlets, international corporations, and financial markets, New York, the Big Apple, has long attracted large numbers of immigrants, as well as people from all over the United States. They settled in the city because of its culture, energy, cosmopolitanism, and economic opportunity. Perhaps the most compelling reality of the eight-county New York area Jewish community (the five counties of New York City and Westchester County, Nassau County and Suffolk County) at the tail end of the 20th century was its sheer size. The New York area was home to the largest Jewish community in the world outside of Israel: 643,000 Jewish households; 1,412,000 adults who consider themselves Jewish and children being raised as Jews; and 1,667,000 people living in Jewish households, including non-Jews (typically spouses who are not Jewish or children not being raised as Jews).</p><p>Kings County (Brooklyn) with 456,000 Jews led the way in a 2002 survey by Jewish Community Studies of New York, followed by Manhattan with 243,000, Nassau with 221,000, Queens with 186,000, and Westchester with 129,000. Suffolk with 90,000, the Bronx with 45,000, and Staten Island with 42,000 Jews had the smallest Jewish populations. One out of eight individuals in the eight-county New York area was Jewish. In the United States as a whole (including New York), nearly one person in 50 was Jewish. Of all the Jewish communities in the United States, only <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> was home to more Jews than the borough of Brooklyn. Manhattan and Nassau County each had more Jews than either the Boston or Philadelphia areas. During the 1990s, the population remained essentially stable: the number of Jewish households increased by less than 1% and the number of Jewish people decreased by less than 1%. But the number of people in Jewish households increased by 7%, from 1,554,000 in 1991 to 1,667,000 in 2002.</p><p>The city, despite a 5% decrease in population, towered as the geographic hub of the Jewish community, providing leadership and guidance in social, recreational, health, cultural, and educational programs, as well as delivering major philanthropic support from virtually all fields of endeavor. Unlike other Eastern and Midwestern Jewish communities, where suburbanization changed the geography of Jewish life, most Jewish households–70%–were found in the city proper.</p><p>During the 1990s, however, there were substantial geographic shifts: greener, more affluent, car-friendly Westchester County recorded a 41% increase in the number of Jews from 1991 to 2002. Both Brooklyn, where large-family Ḥasidim and Russian immigrants flourished, and once-remote Staten Island experienced significant increases, 23% and 27%, respectively. The Bronx, despite a stable – and vibrant – Jewish community in Riverdale, showed a 45% decline, continuing a decades-long trend. Smaller declines occurred in Queens (20%) and Manhattan (21%).</p><p>During the 1990s, there were substantial changes in the composition of the population. In 1991, children made up 22% of the community while seniors aged 65+ made up 16%. In 2002, the community included about the same percentage of children younger than 18 but seniors were 20%. In addition, reflecting greater longevity because of advances in health care, those 75 or older more than doubled after 1991, from 5% to 11%. One organization, the Jewish Association for Services to the Aged, beginning in 1968, became a prime social-service agency in the city and suburbs, with assistance on home, housing, and legal services on a nonsectarian basis, to help sustain the elderly in their homes and communities and to offer opportunities for a better quality of life.</p><p>Unlike Jewish communities in other parts of the United States, New York's was a mix of different kinds of households. Over 378,000 lived in Orthodox homes (240,000 in Brooklyn, many in the distinct Ḥasidic garb). Over 220,000 lived in Russian-speaking households, about 94% of them in the five boroughs. In 1991, 13% of all Jewish adults said they had been born outside the United States. By 2002, this percentage had increased to 27%. Adults born in the former <a class="interlinked" href="/places/commonwealth-independent-states-and-baltic-nations/cis-and-baltic-political-geography/soviet">Soviet Union</a> accounted for 43% of all foreign-born adults in 2002, compared with 26% in 1991.</p><p>The New York area, with 55,000 people, also had by far the largest number of survivors of the Holocaust in the United States, although it was aging significantly. Singles accounted for 35% of the Jewish households in Manhattan, which was home to one of the greatest concentrations of Jewish singles in the United States, 55,000, according to the 2002 survey. These singles participated in a broad range of social and cultural activities tied to a variety of Jewish institutions. Many singles successfully trolled popular Internet sites like JDate.com in an effort to meet their lifetime mates.</p><p>One of the most contentious and troublesome issues in Jewish life was intermarriage. In 2002, according to the survey, the New York rate, 22%, was approximately half the national average, probably because of the large Ḥasidic population, where arranged marriages were not uncommon, and the insular Russian groups, who often selected Russian-speaking mates. While still low by national standards, intermarriage rates in the eight-county area increased significantly (36% of marriages) in the 1998–2002 period.</p><p>Jewish children aged 6 to 17 had relatively high levels of Jewish education. About 45% were enrolled in a full-time Jewish day school. Only 13% had not received any formal Jewish education.</p><p>While there was substantial affluence within the community, there was also substantial poverty. As 17% of New York Jewish households reported an income of more than $150,000 a year, 31% said they had an annual income of less than $35,000. There were more poor Jews in New York than there were Jews in all but the largest Jewish communities in the United States. Poverty increased significantly in New York City after 1991 during a period when overall poverty rates in the city declined. From 1991 to 2002, the number of people estimated to be living in Jewish households under the poverty level in New York City rose from 167,500 to 226,000, an increase of 35%.</p><p>The poorest by far in the survey were in Russian-speaking households with seniors age 65 or older. Eighty-five percent of people who were both older and Russian-speaking reported significant poverty-level incomes, reflecting limited American work histories and therefore lack of qualification for traditional Social Security and private pensions. This group seemed to reflect the immigrant period of struggle and adjustment on the road to absorption in the American community.</p><p>Many people have defined New York by its ever-changing and ever-renewing neighborhoods, from the densely populated Lower East Side around the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century to the apartment-house-dominated Bronx and Queens at the middle and end of that century. Jewish New York in the 21<sup>st</sup> century was a continuation of that phenomenon, of living with like-minded and economically equal neighbors. About 84% of the Jews in the area lived in 26 specific areas. One out of four lived in five areas: Flatbush/Midwood/Kensington (107,800); Boro Park (82,600); the Upper East Side (73,300); the Upper West Side (71,800); and Central/Southeastern Westchester (64,300), a relatively easy commute to Manhattan.</p><p>In Brooklyn neighborhoods like Boro Park, Flatbush, Kings Bay/Madison and Coney Island/Brighton and in Nassau County's Five Towns, on the city's border, over 40% of the residents were Jewish. By contrast, areas like the Northeast Bronx, Western Suffolk, Southwestern Westchester, and Central Suffolk had Jewish populations of only 10%.</p><p>[Jacob B. Ukeles (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h3><a id="POLITICAL_AND_CIVIC_LIFE_2">political and civic life</a></h3><p>In the last quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and into the 21<sup>st</sup>, Jews operated at the center of New York political life and power, partly because of numbers and partly because of the high percentage of voter turnout, even in off-year elections. Following in the long tradition of activism and participation in democratic government, Jews took strong roles in city affairs, neighborhood disputes, and grass-roots activities. Political-minded individuals often sought change through the ballot box or by becoming candidates themselves. As of 2006, three of the previous five mayors (and none before them) were Jewish: <a data-article="296636" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/beame-abraham-david">Abraham D. *Beame</a>, elected in 1973, <a data-article="652826" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/koch-edward-irving"><a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/british-and-irish-history-biographies/edward-i">Edward I</a>. *Koch</a>, who served three four-year terms, and <a data-article="391109" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bloomberg-michael-r">Michael R. *Bloomberg</a>, who won re-election in 2005 with a whopping 59% of the vote. The candidates had taken different roads to the top, reflecting the complexity, diversity, and realities of political life in the city. Beame came up through the ranks of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, using his skills as an accountant to eventually win election as city comptroller, guardian of the finances. He followed the flashy tenure of John Lindsay, who led the city into a financial crisis. Beame's financial skills were not deft enough to save the city from near ruin, but eventually the city emerged with the help of some key power brokers (who happened to be Jewish): Felix Rohatyn, a Wall Street figure, and Victor Gotbaum, a labor leader, who put together a plan to save the city with new bonds and commitments from the well-financed union-city pension funds. Koch became active in his local reform Democratic organization in Greenwich Village, fighting to maintain its special neighborhood characteristics. After defeating a longtime "boss" in his home district, Koch secured the nomination to represent the area in the House of Representatives. He won the seat and served until he gained the mayoralty nomination and then triumphed in the citywide election. Bloomberg, a Democrat who ran as a Republican, was given little chance in the heavily Democratic city. But the multibillionaire businessman spent lavishly and campaigned hard and defeated a little-known candidate. When he ran for re-election, the formerly shy Bloomberg, who was not known for his religious observance, had no hesitancy about reaching out to Jewish audiences, and he campaigned in the Catskills, a favorite summertime retreat for New York Jews. Privately, he was one of the most philanthropic individuals in the world. He contributed regularly to at least a dozen Jewish organizations or institutions, and he and his sister endowed a fund in their mother's name to send teenagers to a kosher camp that is part of Young Judaea, a Zionist youth movement. And just before the election, ultra-Orthodox leaders in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, held what was by far the largest rally of Bloomberg's campaign. With searchlights flashing across the sky and klezmer music blaring from loudspeakers hoisted on cranes, thousands of Ḥasidim cheered the mayor from rooftops and blocks upon blocks of bleachers. One barely mentioned controversy involved the city's Health Department drive, as a preventive measure, to ban an ancient form of ritual circumcision practiced by some Ḥasidic <i>mohelim</i> that had been linked to three cases of neonatal herpes in late 2004, one of them fatal. And as an indication of the sensitivity and power of the Jewish electorate, a candidate for a fringe party, Lenora Fulani, who had said that Jews "had to sell their souls to acquire Israel" and had to "function as mass murderers of people of color," was removed from a leadership position after her party concluded that her inflammatory comments about Jews were "outrageous and distasteful."</p><p>During that period, prominent Jewish officeholders showed their ambitions by making runs for nomination or election but fell short. They included Ruth Messinger, then borough president of Manhattan and later president of the American Jewish World Service; Harrison J. (Jay) Goldin, the city's comptroller during the Beame years and president of the American Jewish Congress' Metropolitan Region; Albert Blumenthal, who was majority leader of the New York State Assembly; Richard Ravitch, former head of the Metropolitan Transit Authority who also served as head of the Jewish Community Relations Council and the Charter Revision Commission; Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir and former head of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations and former Ambassador to Austria, and Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressional aide to Charles *Schumer, later U.S. Senator Schumer.</p><p>It was not unusual in New York City to see politicians strolling the streets or ambling in the parks, chatting with constituents. Although their surnames easily identified them as Jews, they did not campaign or serve as Jewish office holders, particularly in a vast, multicultural environment. One regular was Henry J. Stern, who served as Parks Commissioner for more than a dozen years under six mayors. Another popular political figure, Robert Morgenthau, son of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Treasury secretary, <a data-article="650077" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/morgenthau">Henry *Morgenthau</a>, Jr., won election as Manhattan district attorney in 1974 and kept getting elected, even at the age of 86, serving more than 32 years, a record. From his safe Lower East Side district, Sheldon Silver, Orthodox and observant, exercised considerable power in Albany for many years as a leader of the state assembly, a position he attained through seniority and political dexterity. In Congress, no one fought harder for equal rights for women than Bella S. Abzug, who represented a Manhattan district in Congress. Abzug, who was active in several feminist groups, including now, pressed for an <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/equal-rights-amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>, but the measure failed to gain approval in enough state legislatures to be adopted.</p><p>A number of Jews tried to use their political and financial base in New York City as a springboard for national or statewide office. These included three attorney generals: <a data-article="297221" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lefkowitz-louis">Louis *Lefkowitz</a>, a popular Republican who campaigned as Looie, and two Democrats, <a data-article="359192" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/abrams-robert">Robert *Abrams</a> and <a data-article="295690" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/spitzer-eliot">Elliot *Spitzer</a>; and the comptrollers Alan Hevesi and Arthur Levitt, Sr., who served for six terms until 1979 and whose son, Arthur Levitt, Jr. was chairman of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/money-banking-and-investment/securities-and">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. During the last quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, all the governors of New York were gentiles. By the second half of the 20th century, realizing that they had to appeal to a broad and more sophisticated electorate, Jewish candidates were barely mentioning their religious affiliation.</p><p>One crowning achievement, the appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsberg of New York to the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/supreme-court/united-states-supreme-court">United States Supreme Court</a> in 1993, pointed to the importance of both Jews and women in politics.</p><p>In the last quarter of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, no citywide candidate could be elected without Jewish votes and no statewide candidate could ignore the sizable downstate Jewish vote in the city, on Long Island and in Westchester. Either because of firmly held opinions or because of political considerations, non-Jewish candidates for citywide and statewide office often took strong pro-Israel stances. Famously, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani turned down a donation for the victims of 9/11 from a Saudi Prince who had tied the 9/11 attacks to U.S. policy in favor of Israel. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who served 18 years in the Senate, was an ardent champion of Israel. Senator <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/daniel-patrick-moynihan">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</a> was beloved in the Jewish community because of his support for Israel during his tenure as U.S. ambassador to the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/united-nations/united-nations">United Nations</a>. In 1975, when the u.n. passed a resolution declaring "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination," basically an endorsement of antisemitism, Moynihan said: "This is a lie." And when <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/african-history-biographies/idi-amin">Idi Amin</a>, the tyrant who ruled Uganda, went before the world body and demanded the "extinction of Israel as a state," Moynihan called him a "racist murderer." Moynihan, who had never visited the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/asia/middle-eastern-physical-geography/middle-east">Middle East</a>, took his political direction from the State Department, he said, but on Zionism, Jewish history, antisemitism, and related topics, he relied on the advice of Norman Podhoretz, editor of <i>Commentary</i> magazine, and by that time a neoconservative, as was Moynihan. The senator was also a vigorous supporter of the rights of Soviet Jewry. Moynihan spoke out publicly and worked tirelessly with Jewish groups to get the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/commonwealth-independent-states-and-baltic-nations/cis-and-baltic-political-geography/soviet">Soviet Union</a> to relax its grip on the dissidents and other Jews who sought to leave the Communist state. More recently, Hillary Clinton, who while First Lady committed the faux pas of embracing Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasser Arafat, became one of the most avid supporters of Israel in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>New York was the most important source of political fund-raising in the United States. Four of the top five zip codes in the nation for contributions were in Manhattan. The top zip code, 10021, on the Upper East Side, where many wealthy Jews resided, generated the most money for the 2000 presidential campaigns of both George W. Bush and Al Gore.</p><p>No event touched the soul of New York more than the attacks on the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a> towers on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. There were Jewish victims among the almost 3,000 dead, of course, but they had not been singled out as Jews. Indeed, the diversity of the victims was one of the hallmarks of the event, a tragedy that cut across all ethnic and religious lines, but the Moslem extremists who perpetrated the attack had identified Jews with New York City and with American capitalism. One rumor in the Moslem world that circulated shortly after the attacks was that Jews working in the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a> had received phone calls from Israel warning them not to go to work on Sept. 11. The rumor was patently false.</p><p>A few years later, after the dust had settled, literally and figuratively, Larry Silverstein, the owner of the property, sought to rebuild after receiving insurance payments for both buildings. He enlisted the architect Daniel Liebeskind to design new towers and a memorial to the victims, but the project became bogged down in disputes among the city, state, families of the victims, commercial interests and others. Liebeskind's design was eventually abandoned and the timetable for construction was delayed.</p><p>[Neil Goldstein (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h3><a id="BUSINESS_AND_ECONOMICS">business and economics</a></h3><p>As the city emerged from its financial nightmare of the early 1970s ("Ford to City: Drop Dead," was the headline in <i>The Daily News</i> when its plea for aid was turned down by the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/white-house">White House</a>) and became reenergized, it became clear that the economy and the engines that ran it were ready to reassert New York's primary position in the world of finance. On Wall Street, in banking, in fashion and merchandising, in department stores and in diamonds, among other areas, many Jewish New Yorkers were in the front ranks of movers and shakers. The old German-Jewish families that had established beachheads even before the wave of immigrants arrived toward the end of the 19th century, the Schiffs, Warburgs, Lehmans, Morgenthaus, Oppenheims, and Guggenheims, to name a few, remained in the top tier at the giant financial brokerages like Kuhn Loeb, Goldman Sachs, Lazard Frères, and their successors. But the firms were so large that by the 21<sup>st</sup> century management was in the hands of a multitude of partners and officers, many of whom were Jewish and many of whom were not. Some individuals earned reputations on Wall Street, like Abby Joseph Cohen, a lead financial analyst for Merrill, Lynch, and Felix Rohatyn, who headed Lazard Frères, with time out for service as Ambassador to France, and Saul Steinberg, who rode a tiger to great wealth and renown in the insurance industry, only to suffer a letdown. Henry Kravis and Peter Kalikow won fame in a series of leveraged buyouts and Gerald Levin wound up as chief executive of the merged Time Warner aol empire. Carl Icahn earned his stripes as a feared corporate raider and Ivan Boesky won riches and then shame dealing in junk bonds and other enterprises. Peter Cohen headed American Express for a time. The Greenberg clan, father Maurice and two sons, were powers in the insurance business, heading major companies until a scandal in 2005. Mortimer Zuckerman, who made a fortune in real estate in Boston and New York, bought and was publisher of <i>The Daily News,</i> once the newspaper with the largest daily circulation in the United States. Robert E. Rubin, who was born in New York, rose from the risk arbitrage department at Goldman Sachs to become its vice chairman and co-chief operating officer until he was plucked by President Clinton to serve in his administration. Rubin became the 70<sup>th</sup> United States Secretary of the Treasury, spanning both Clinton terms. And with New York as his base, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/george-soros">George Soros</a>, an immigrant from Hungary, formed private hedge funds and became the wealthiest man in the world – until he decided to start giving away much of his fortune to charitable endeavors. In the same vein, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> started on Wall Street and established a financial information service that became a "must have" for financial institutions large and small. Bloomberg, removing himself from his far-flung business empire, which included computerized data and radio and television stations stressing financial news, twice won election as Mayor of New York. In banking, Sanford G. Weill rose to become chairman of Citigroup, one of the largest institutions in the United States, encompassing banking, credit cards, mortgages, home equity loans, the brokerage Smith Barney and other consumer financial services. In the unpublicized and lightly regulated field of money management, investors like Michael Steinhardt accumulated fortunes. Steinhardt used some of the funds to become the driving force behind Birthright Israel, a project aimed at strengthening the connection between young Jews and Israel.</p><p>Estee Lauder, who was born in Queens, transformed beauty into <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/big-business">big business</a>. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, her company controlled 45% of the cosmetics market in U.S. department stores. Its products were sold in 118 countries. Even after 40 years in business, she attended the launch of every new cosmetics counter or shop. Her sons Ronald and Leonard were important figures in New York business, culture and philanthropy. Well-known names in the fashion industry like <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/fashion-biographies/ralph-lauren">Ralph Lauren</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/fashion-biographies/calvin-klein">Calvin Klein</a>, Isaac Mizrachi, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/fashion-biographies/liz-claiborne">Liz Claiborne</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/history/historians-and-chronicles/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/marc-jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a> found exposure in the great department and clothing stores of New York, like Jewish-founded Barney's (once a store for hard-to-fit youth but later a fashion emporium), Bloomingdale's, B. Altman, Gimbel's, Saks, and Macy's. But in the face of competition and changing tastes, the family-started stores found it difficult to continue. Some closed and some were bought out. One venture, Alexander's, the best-known clothing store in the Bronx, was owned by the Farkas family. When it expanded to Manhattan and opened a vast store near Bloomingdale's, Alexander's failed, and the family eventually closed its stores. The tale of Stern's, once a magnet for class-conscious German immigrants early in the century, later a destination for the aspiring middle class after World War ii, provided a case in point. Four sons of an impoverished German Jewish immigrant founded Stern's in 1867. Buoyed by their initial success, the Stern brothers led a retail migration to Ladies' Mile in 1878 with the opening of a seven-story building on 23<sup>d</sup> Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. It was the largest department store in New York until 1910. In 1913 the store moved to 42<sup>nd</sup> Street and Fifth Avenue and catered to show business people because of its proximity to Broadway. The store stocked other merchandise in an attempt to feed the aspirations of less wealthy shoppers. It thrived in this middle-market niche for decades but in 1951 Stern's was bought by Allied Stores and a new era began. In the competitive postwar retail landscape, Stern's began marketing itself to the masses. But ultimately, Stern's lost out to big box stores and to the fact that, during the 1980s, customers of all incomes became bargain hunters. Stern's is now gone. And Bloomingdale's and Macy's became part of Federated Department Stores. Another family-owned concern rose up out of Brooklyn to succeed, on a smaller scale, on Long Island, in Manhattan, and in suburban <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> and Westchester. In the Brownsville-East New York section of Brooklyn in the 1920s, under an elevated subway line, Max and Clara Fortunoff sold dishes, linens, and other dry goods at low prices. As they watched the neighborhood decline in the late 1960s, the Fortunoff offspring sensed that their customers were moving to Long Island, so Fortunoff branched out to Long Island with housewares, furniture, luggage, and luxury goods like fine china and jewelry. In Manhattan, Fortunoff opened a jewelry store on Fifth Avenue.</p><p>Throughout this period, and stretching back to before World War ii, 47<sup>th</sup> Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues flourished as the diamond capital of the United States. It was a tightly-knit industry and was controlled by Jews, just as it had been for centuries, from the mines in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/africa/south-african-political-geography/south-africa">South Africa</a> to the skilled cutting and polishing craftsmen in Antwerp and other world capitals. As in the diamond exchange in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/asia/israeli-political-geography/tel-aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, deals on 47<sup>th</sup> Street were consummated by handshake and Yiddish confirmations. Trust ruled the transactions. Dozens of sales people, many in Ḥasidic garb, dominated the streets, which had the highest concentration of police protection in the city to thwart temptation. Secrecy and discretion were unspoken bywords, and in the 21<sup>st</sup> century the diamond district remained almost totally in Jewish hands.</p><h3><a id="REAL_ESTATE_AND_HOUSING">real estate and housing</a></h3><p>The real-estate business in the city was a dynastic enterprise, the great fortunes being passed down from one generation to another, and Jewish families were front-and-center in acquiring land, building homes and commercial structures, and running vast enterprises. The practice bore little relationship to the modern world of the corporation. While the elders and parents of a generation made deals and brokered arrangements, their children went to school and summer camp with one another, cementing relationships for the future. The families, Rose, Tishman, Rudin, Milstein, Tish, LeFrak, to cite a few, occupied the top tiers of the business. These oligarchies were only a few generations old, tracing their roots and business involvement to the immigrant arrivals and pushcarts that flooded New York in the previous century. Some concentrated in Manhattan, shrewdly accumulating property slowly and rarely selling. Others tried to be prudent, rarely taking risks. Others built massively in the outer boroughs like Brooklyn and Queens, where lower prices prevailed. In addition to shaping the landscape of New York City, the families were the backbone of philanthropy. Not only did they give extensively to Jewish charities, but they were identified with hospitals and educational institutions. And many found the time to serve in high positions in government and civic life. Lewis Rudin, for example, was the founder of a group called the Association for a Better New York, which promoted the city's reputation and performed good works. Seymour Milstein and his brothers, on the other hand, used their fortune to buy other companies, and at one time owned United Brands, the Starett Housing Corporation, and Emigrant Savings Bank. Although they gave their word to city officials that they would protect the famed gilded clock and Palm Court lounge of the Biltmore Hotel, they demolished both in 1981. The family, once extraordinarily close, later split, and filed so many suits against one another that they almost destroyed themselves. When Seymour Milstein died in 2001, his nephew issued a statement that read in its entirety: "We will always cherish the happy times we shared and our many years together."</p><p>If the real estate interests were bound by common interests, so were the social strivers who sought the best living arrangements. While the state banned discrimination in the sale and rental of housing, Jews in New York sometimes experienced more subtle stumbling blocks. Many of the grand old buildings lining Central Park West and Fifth and Park Avenues in Manhattan were cooperatives, and prospective tenants had to be screened and approved by the respective boards before being allowed to make their purchase. A number of high-profile, wealthy Jews, like <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/barbra-streisand">Barbra Streisand</a>, the singer; Mike Wallace, the television reporter; Ron Perelman, the financier; and Steve Wynn, the casino entrepreneur, were rejected, usually without reason. The co-ops functioned as private clubs and could determine if the applicant possessed the "right" connections or ethnicity or earned their living in an "approved" manner. Sometimes Jews were admitted one week and not the next, after some quota was reached. Whereas religion was once a key unspoken factor, by the early years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century rejection on economic grounds was much more common as old prejudices lost much of their sting.</p><h3><a id="CULTURE_2">culture</a></h3><p>Following the success of Stephen Birmingham's <i>Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York</i>, published in 1967, Irving Howe weighed in with <i>World of Our Fathers</i> in 1973. Historically, the exhaustively researched tale of Jewish immigrant life on the Lower East Side provided a cultural anthropology spanning the Old Country to the settlement houses and synagogues, the matchmakers, dance halls, and the culture of Yiddish, from poets, novelists, and intellectuals to theatrical figures and popular entertainers. Although he was a scholar and an intellectual, Howe in <i>World of Our Fathers</i> taught a new generation about the notion of egalitarian socialism and how it emerged from the struggle for social justice, according to Morris Dickstein, writing two decades after the publication of the surprise best-seller. The book, written with the assistance of Kenneth Libo, made its way into virtually every Jewish home, and its readers, many of them second-generation Jews who had moved to the suburbs, were able to reconnect to a world of struggle and idealism.</p><p>Although Bernard Malamud, who died in 1986, set many of his stories in New York, sometimes a geographical New York, sometimes a metaphysical one, and used Jewish characters extensively, he was not considered a "Jewish" writer, but rather an American writer. To the writer and critic Jonathan Rosen, Malamud's city was a place of surprises, of trials, and of ultimate meaning. In his best fiction, New York haunted his imagination, and his prose told the story of struggling tailors, shoemakers, matchmakers, light-bulb peddlers, and immigrants. His work, critics said, showed a regard for tradition and the plight of ordinary men, and was imbued with the theme of moral wisdom gained through suffering. His death was followed five years later by that of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/hebrew-literature-biographies/isaac-bashevis-singer">Isaac Bashevis Singer</a>, who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1978. Singer wrote largely in Yiddish, although he had lived in New York since before World War ii. His 1970 novel, <i>Enemies: A Love Story</i>, set in 1949 in New York, dealt with survivors of the Holocaust who felt guilty about having survived. It became a successful film in 1989.</p><p>The immigrant experience provided the background for <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/el-doctorow">E.L. Doctorow</a>'s <i>Ragtime</i>, first as a novel in 1975 and then as a musical on Broadway in 1998. Doctorow, a New Yorker, had earlier won acclaim for <i>The Book of Daniel</i>, a fictionalized story of the executed atomic spies, the Rosenbergs, in 1971.</p><p>On the stage, through the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Arthur Miller continued to churn out drama, although none achieved the commercial or critical success of his earlier works, which included <i>All My Sons</i> and <i>After <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/christianity-general/fall">the Fall</a></i>, a fictionalized version of his life with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/marilyn-monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, who converted to Judaism for their marriage.</p><p>The Broadway stage proved the perfect vehicle for Wendy Wasserstein (d. 2006), a Brooklyn-born playwright of wry, smart, and often highly comical plays. In 1989 she won both the Tony and <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing/journalism-and-publishing/pulitzer-prizes">Pulitzer Prizes</a> for her play <i>The Heidi Chronicles</i>, and explored topics ranging from feminism to family to pop culture in such works as <i>The Sisters Rosensweig, Isn't It Romantic</i> and <i>An American Daughter</i>. Like Miller, who often mixed his art and politics, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/theater-biographies/tony-kushner">Tony Kushner</a>, who was born in New York and educated there, made a splash with <i>Angelsin America,</i> a two-play exploration of the state of the nation in terms of sexual, racial, religious, political, and social issues that confronted the nation during the Ronald Reagan years as the aids epidemic spread. <i>Angels</i> is really two full-length plays. Part i:<i>Millenium Approaches</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1993. Part ii:<i>Perestroika,</i> won the Tony award. Four characters represented Jews, Christians and agnostics; homosexuals and heterosexuals; blacks and whites; and men and women caregivers and patients – an American mix. The prolific Kushner's masterpiece was directed for television in 2004 by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/mike-nichols">Mike Nichols</a>, proving its durability, and won numerous awards. aids, the great affliction of the 1980s in New York, found its chief stage and real-life opponent in Larry Kramer, a dramatist, author and gay rights activist. Beginning in 1981, Kramer published a series of articles on the growing aids epidemic, urging immediate government and private action. He was a founder of Gay Men's Health Crisis, a New York-based advocacy group, which remains the world's largest provider of services to gay men with aids. In 1987, increasingly discontented with the response to aids by both the U.S. government and the gay male community, Kramer founded the aids advocacy and protest organization, act-up, which engaged in <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/social-reform/civil-disobedience">civil disobedience</a>. His 1985 play about the early years of aids, <i>The Normal Heart</i>, was one of the most important cultural responses in the 1980s to the devastation of aids. It had more than 600 productions all over the world.</p><p>By contrast, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/mel-brooks">Mel Brooks</a>, the comedian and comedy writer, adapted his 1968 movie, <i>The Producers</i>, into a Broadway musical, with Thomas Meehan. The outrageous work was the smash hit of the 2000-2001 season, winning 12 Tony Awards, the most for one show. Brooks wrote the satiric – and some said offensive – <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>, a number that carried the story line, about a down and out producer who raises money for the world's worst show, a musical based on the life of Hitler. The humor took political incorrectness to a new level, which Brooks defended by saying that he had "to bring Hitler down with ridicule. It's been one of my life-long jobs – to make the world laugh at <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/german-history-biographies/adolf-hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>."</p><p>On television, one of the most popular programs of the 1990s was <i>Seinfeld,</i> a comedy about "nothing." Set in New York, the program had four main characters: Jerry Seinfeld, a comedian; George Costanza, played by <a data-article="391088" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/alexander-jason">Jason *Alexander</a> and based on the life of the show's co-creator, Larry David; Elaine Benes, played by <a data-article="391222" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/louis-dreyfus-julia">Julia *Louis-Dreyfus</a>; and the lovable but loopy Kramer, portrayed by Michael Richards, based on a real New Yorker named Kramer. Many scenes were shot in a reproduction of a Manhattan diner and explored familiar problems among singles in the city.</p><p>In 2004 the Jewish Museum celebrated its 100th birthday, having achieved the status of one of the city's major art museums. The museum began as a repository of Jewish culture but became a significant force in the art world, unafraid to mount exhibitions with provocative themes that challenged and sometimes angered visitors. Before World War ii, it bought important Judaica and became an important home to objects from a lost civilization. It expanded in 1983, adding exhibition space and a kosher café. Membership reached 11,250 and visitors reached more than 200,000 a year by around 2005. The museum was not the only repository of Jewish heritage. In 2003 a Center for Jewish History opened in four buildings in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The center's members include: the American Jewish Historical Society, the American Sephardi Federation, the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/judaism-biographies/leo-baeck">Leo Baeck</a> Institute, the Yeshiva University Museum, and the yivo Institute for Jewish Research. At the end of the 20th century, the Museum of Jewish Heritage opened at the foot of Manhattan as a living memorial to the Holocaust. The museum honored those who died by celebrating their lives. Its core exhibition of photographs, personal objects, and original films illustrated the story of Jewish heritage in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>Perhaps the best-known cultural center in New York was the 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Y, a multifaceted institution and cultural center founded in 1874 by German-Jewish professionals. It grew from an organization guided by Jewish principles but serving people of all races and faiths. In 2006, it was serving over 300,000 people annually in 200 programs a day. Its programming encompassed Jewish education and culture, concerts featuring classical, jazz, and popular music, humanities classes, dance performances, film screenings, a <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/nursery-school">nursery school</a>, etc.</p><h3><a id="RACE_RELATIONS">race relations</a></h3><p>The most densely populated major city in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/north-america">North America</a>, New York became known as "the melting pot" because of its hordes of immigrants from diverse places in Europe. But that sobriquet took on new meaning in the 1960s and later in a changing city as advocates for civil rights stepped up pressure for equal treatment in schools, housing, and employment. In 1984, the Rev. Jesse Jackson became the second black American to mount a nationwide campaign for President of the United States, running as a Democrat. A major controversy erupted early in the campaigns when Jackson, speaking to reporters, referred to Jews as "hymies" and to New York City as "Hymietown." Later he made a perfunctory apology. While Jews, themselves victims of discrimination, had lived side-by-side with blacks for decades, and had been prominent in leadership and financial support for civil rights causes, they, and the city, were living in a new time. Crime was high on the list of concerns in the late 1960s and 1970s, drugs appeared to be easy to come by and many whites and blacks were eyeing each other warily. In 1991, in what came to be an iconic moment in the relationship between Jews and blacks in the city, a car in the motorcade of the Lubavitch grand rabbi, Menachem M. Schneerson, swerved onto a sidewalk, killing a 7-year-old black boy, Gavin Cato. The accident, combined with simmering tensions between Orthodox Jews and black residents, created a cauldron of ethnic suspicions. Three hours later, a group of black youths, incited by cries of "go get a Jew," attacked Yankel Rosenbaum, an Australian Lubavitch student, apparently in retaliation. Four days of rioting and violence engulfed Crown Heights, headquarters of the Lubavitch, and a prosecutor called the crimes "emblematic of the worst kind of violence and religious hatred this city has every seen." Fueling the violence was a deep-rooted belief among many blacks in Crown Heights that Jews received preferential treatment, not only from the police but also in city services. (In fact, studies after the disturbances showed that black organizations in Crown Heights received more city and state money than many Ḥasidic organizations.) Before his death, Rosenbaum identified Lemrick Nelson Jr., then 16, as his assailant. A bloody knife was found in Nelson's possession, and Nelson confessed the murder to the police. But a jury of six blacks, four Hispanics and two whites acquitted him. A day later, the jury members joined Nelson and his lawyer in a New York restaurant to celebrate the verdict. In a second trial, in 2003, Nelson was found guilty of violating Rosenbaum's civil rights, but the jury found that he had not directly caused Rosenbaum's death. The hate-crime killing seemed to have symbolized much of what had gone wrong in the special relationship between blacks and Jews in the city and was tirelessly debated on the streets, in the media, and in the courts. It took years for the case to be settled, and passions aroused by the incident were slow to cool. For David N. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, Crown Heights became a crushing political weight, and he was defeated when he sought re-election. Because the case took so many years in the courts, many youths in Crown Heights interviewed in the early years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century were barely aware of the circumstances of the deaths.</p><p>While relations between blacks and Jews were sometimes fragile in New York, Jews in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century were thrust into the debate over events in Israel, particularly on college campuses, as professors and students took a hostile approach to developments in the Middle East. On the campuses of <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/columbia-university">Columbia University</a> and Barnard, for instance, pro-Israel students said they had been intimidated by professors of Middle Eastern studies both in and out of the classroom. Symbolically, the incident pointed to a mood on American campuses skeptical of Israeli activities and sympathetic to Palestinian complaints, views originally espoused and pursued by the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-parties-and-movements/new-left">New Left</a> of the 1960s and 1990s.</p><h3><a id="UJA_FEDERATION_AND_ITS_ROLE_IN_THE_COMMUNITY">uja-federation and its role in the community</a></h3><p>As the largest avenue of philanthropy in New York and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/north-america">North America</a>, uja-Federation consistently ranked in the top tier of <i>The Chronicle of Philanthropy's</i> listing of U.S. charities that raised the most in donations from individuals, foundations, and corporations. The only institutions that raised more funds made national appeals (American <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/international-organizations/red-cross">Red Cross</a>) or used funds primarily for endowment and plant rather than programs (universities, hospitals, and museums), making uja-Federation of New York the largest broadly-based local philanthropy in the United States. In 2005, its campaign year closed at a record-breaking $231,347,113, including $140 million from its annual campaign, $71.9 million in planned giving and endowments, and $15.9 million raised through capital gifts and special initiatives. An additional $3.3 million was contributed to an emergency relief fund. The total combined budget of uja-Federation's local network of agencies exceeded $1 billion.</p><p>In 1973, at the outbreak of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/asia-and-africa/israeli-history/yom-kippur-war">Yom Kippur War</a>, community leaders combined the Federation campaign with a special United Jewish Appeal Drive called the Israel Emergency Fund. After raising a record $100 million, the uja-Federation Joint Campaign was created in July 1974 and Israel became the primary Jewish concern of the bulk of New York Jews. To meet both local and overseas needs, the joint effort raised an average of $100 million annually, reaching $110 million by 1983.</p><p>In 1999, uja-Federation of New York became the first federation in the country to see the division of "domestic" and "overseas" as anachronistic and to instead organize its planning and allocations around types of services like health and human services, Jewish education and identity building, and Jewish peoplehood (rescue, resettlement, and fostering connections between Jewish communities in New York, Israel, and around the world).</p><p>As political, social, and technological changes fostered this increasingly global focus, other economic, social, and tax law changes forced changes in how the federation raised its funds. The primary vehicle for fundraising remained the Annual Campaign. At the time, 80 to 90 percent of the funds came from just 10 to 20 percent of the donors. While efforts continued to be made to broaden the base, through direct marketing (mail and phone) and <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/computers-and-electrical-engineering/computers-and-computing/internet">the Internet</a>, the majority of the organization's fundraising efforts were targeted at higher-end donors through one-on-one relationships and to mid-level donors at more than 700 fundraising events each year targeting specific trades and professions, synagogues, communities, women, and families. uja-Federation also opened full-service offices in Westchester (1988) and Long Island (1989), where affluent Jewish populations resided. The Annual Campaign reached over $120 million per year from over 75,000 donors in the first years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. At the same time, the donor base was shrinking (as recently as 1996, there had been over 91,000 donors), cuts in government spending for social services placed significant pressure on the agencies, and the modest increases in the campaign were counterbalanced by the effects of inflation.</p><p>By the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, needs had further shifted. The majority of Jews in New York were now long-time Americans who no longer needed help with the most basic needs and with integration into American society. The enormous wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union slowed down by the mid-1990s, and immigration was not anticipated ever to reach such heights again. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, uja-Federation's mission was revised to place equal emphasis on caring for those in need, rescuing those in harm's way, and renewing and strengthening the Jewish people in New York, Israel, and around the world. The share of local unrestricted grants for community centers, human-service agencies, and Jewish education increased by 11 percent between 1995 and 2003, while the share of grants to hospitals and geriatric centers decreased by 98 percent and 9 percent, respectively.</p><p>For the human-service agenda, the need to provide services to the most vulnerable continued. Despite the upward mobility of much of the community, significant pockets of poverty existed, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens. Publication in 1971 of "The Invisible Jewish Poor," by Anne Wolfe, revealed widespread poverty among Jews, with particular emphasis on senior citizens. The Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty was created in 1972 to provide clothing, food, housing, and job-placement services to Jewish New Yorkers in poverty. As poverty continued and some populations experienced difficulty accessing public services, the New York Legal Assistance Group was organized in 1990 to provide free legal help to at-risk and low-income individuals. In 2005, uja-Federation developed a comprehensive system for individuals and families coping with terminal illness, helping them access medical, social, psychological, and spiritual care through three regional care centers, and opened the first and only state-certified residential hospice under Jewish auspices in New York State.</p><p>[Jennifer Rosenberg (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h3><a id="RUSSIAN_JEWS">russian jews</a></h3><p>Mention "Russian Jews in New York" and what immediately comes to mind for most New Yorkers is Brighton Beach – a garish, boisterous strip of Russian restaurants, nightclubs, and specialty food stores hunkered under the rumbling elevated subway line. A block or two away is the nearby boardwalk, one of New York's great people-watching locations in the summer, where svelte "New Russians" enjoy caviar and <i>blini</i> at a string of outdoor cafes, while babushkas with golden teeth sit on nearby benches watching their grandchildren play, and knots of men sit at tables playing chess and backgammon.</p><p>Yet Brighton is only the tip of the iceberg of Russian-speaking New York – a sprawling human archipelago of 350,000 people, 70 to 80% of whom are Jewish. According to a 2003 population survey conducted by uja-Federation, 19% of the Jews in the five boroughs of New York were Russian-speakers. The survey found that 62% lived in Brooklyn (124,000), 19% in Queens (39,000); 5% in Staten Island (11,000), 5% in Nassau County (10,000), and 4% in Manhattan (9,000). Russians made up 27% of Brooklyn's Jewish community, 21% of Queens Jewry, and 26% of Staten Island's. It was believed that there were as many as 50,000 Russian-speaking Jews in the suburbs of northern New Jersey.</p><p>The Russian-speaking community got its start in southern Brooklyn during the mid-1970s but spread far beyond that neighborhood east to the more upscale marine communities of Manhattan Beach and Sheepshead Bay, and west to scruffy Coney Island, where it abutted African-American and Hispanic communities. The Russians then spread north to Bensonhurst, which they shared with Italian-Americans, Ocean Parkway, which had a large Syrian Jewish population, and Midwood, where they intersected with Pakistanis and Arab-Americans.</p><p>Away from Brighton Beach and Brooklyn, a second huge enclave of Russian speakers, the exotic Bukharan Jewish community of Persian-speaking Jews from <a data-article="645171" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/uzbekistan">*Uzbekistan</a>, <a data-article="296430" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/tadzhikistan">*Tadjikistan</a>, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, all part of the former Soviet Union, set up home and culture in the Central Queens communities of Rego Park, Forest Hills, and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-physical-geography/kew-gardens">Kew Gardens</a>. There, 50,000 Bukharan Jews lived in streets filled with Bukharan yeshivot, synagogues, and restaurants/nightclubs, from which the sound of sinuous but exuberant Bukharan music exploded into the night. Although Bukhara is a city in Uzbekistan, the term Bukharan refers to all Central Asian Jews who speak Bukhari, a Jewish dialect of Persian. Bukharans celebrate and commemorate in big ways. Nightly, the community turned out for events: weddings, bar mitzvahs, birthdays, cultural presentations or memorials. Whereas most of their homes in Europe faced inner courtyards, in Queens they lived in cramped apartments, so restaurants became their courtyards. The neighborhood, along Queens Boulevard, from Rego Park to Forest Hills to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-physical-geography/kew-gardens">Kew Gardens</a> to Briarwood, featured small businesses runs by Bukharans and ethnic specialties like fried fish, dried fruits, and Samarkand raisins. Kosher bakeries with tandor ovens dispensed crusty round breads called non, topped with black sesame seeds, baked on the clay walls. Noni toki, a domed matzolike bread, was also a favorite, as were samosi, a pastry filled with a nut mixture, and lavz, a mixture of nuts and spices compressed into a flat bar. Most community events involved live music, whether the classical tradition of the shash maqam, a repertory of vocal and instrumental sounds, folk songs, or Russian pop. The Bukharan Jewish National Theater performed regularly, sometimes using its other name, Vozrozhdenie (Russian for renaissance). Twenty synagogues served the community; their prayer books featured Hebrew on one side and a Russian transliteration on the other.</p><p>In that area, too, were the smaller but still substantial Oriental communities of Georgian and Mountain Jews, who hailed from <a data-article="330134" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/azerbaijan">*Azerbaijan</a> and the northern <a data-article="656692" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/caucasus">*Caucasus</a>. Some lived in Washington Heights at the uppermost tip of Manhattan, an area that attracted a community of so-called Russian intelligentsia – artists, writers, and bohemians. Over the years, many Russian families moving into the middle class left the gritty streets of Brooklyn for semi-suburban Staten Island, while others moved on to the commuter towns of northern and central New Jersey, as well as communities in Long Island, Westchester and southern Connecticut.</p><p>The origin of the emigration goes back to the period directly after the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/asia-and-africa/israeli-history/six-day-war">Six-Day War</a> of 1967, when Soviet Jews giddy with the smashing military victory of the Israel Defense Forces against the armed forces of Egypt and Syria, armed to the hilt by the Soviet government, began to shake off their fear of the Soviet regime and demanded to be allowed to repatriate to Israel.</p><p>By the early 1970s, the Soviet government, seeking détente with the West, began to allow some Soviet Jews to leave for Israel on humanitarian grounds, for family reunification. It was during this period that many Soviet Jews who received invitations ("<i>vysov</i>") from real or supposed relatives in Israel managed to get out of the Soviet Union, "dropped out" along the way to Israel in Vienna, and instead applied to emigrate to the United States as political refugees. Though the Israeli government objected strongly to the dropout phenomenon and chastised those who decided to go West, the U.S. Jewish community leadership upheld the principle of freedom of choice and by the late 1970s as many or more Soviet Jews were coming to the U.S. as to Israel. Soviet Jewish immigration to the U.S. started en masse.</p><p>Close to half of all Soviet Jews headed for New York City and a significant number of families and individuals who were brought to smaller communities across the U.S. under the auspices of local Jewish communities also eventually headed for New York, the only city where it soon became possible to lose oneself in a largely Russian environment.</p><p>About a third of the Russian-speaking Jewish population in New York at the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century arrived during the 1970s. The New York Association of New Americans (nyana) provided them with housing, language training, and help in finding jobs, began routing many Russian families to southern Brooklyn, a strongly Jewish area with excellent lowrent housing stock that had become increasingly down at the heels as American-born Jewish families left. The rollicking environment of crass mercantilism and <i>joie de vivre</i> for which Brighton Beach became known had much in common with the spirit of Odessa on the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/black-sea">Black Sea</a>, but even many Jews from very different environments like Moscow and Leningrad initially moved to Brighton so they could live in a Russian linguistic and cultural environment.</p><p>By the late 1970s, restaurants and businesses catering to the Russian community began to spring up, helping to bring renewed economic vigor and stabilizing real estate values.</p><p>As a result of 35 to 40 years of immigration, 700,000 Soviet-born Jews were living in the U.S., about half of them, or 350,000, chose New York and its vicinity as their permanent home. By any account, the number exceeded those of Russia and Ukraine combined, making New York the world's most populous Russian-Jewish city. The 1990s arrivals differed from their predecessors in many respects. The refugees of the 1970s tended to be ideologically deeply anti-Communist and anti-Soviet, ready to risk everything, including a term in prison, for a chance to get to the West. The refugees of the 1990s came at a time of virtually free emigration after Communism had collapsed, and were more inclined to be pursuers of a better life.</p><p>Since education was always a primary social value, Russian Jewish immigrants came with a high level of educational attainment. Their striving for education continued in America, where they made up the best-educated group in U.S. immigration history. Virtually all younger Russian Jews went to college, and New York city, state, and private colleges were full of the Russian-speakers. In 2005, two Russian-Jewish students, Lev Sviridov from the City College and Eugene Shenderov from Brooklyn College, won highly competitive and prestigious Rhodes scholarship for graduate education in Oxford.</p><p>[Sam Kliger and</p><p>Walter Ruby (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h3><a id="NEIGHBORHOODS">neighborhoods</a></h3><p>One of the defining characteristics of New York are the neighborhoods, especially for Jews, who tended to live among fellow religionists for a variety of reasons, including proximity to local synagogues, friends, and familiar foods. Indeed, the history of New York Jewry is intertwined with the history of the neighborhoods: some with accommodating welcome mats, some achieving smashing successes, some declining over the years, some being reborn.</p><p>Following are snapshots of four local areas that have a distinctive Jewish flavor and history:</p><h4><a id="Boro_Park">Boro Park</a></h4><p>With the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish enclave in the world outside Jerusalem, Boro Park combined the atmosphere and strictures of a 19<sup>th</sup>-century European religious-based village with many of the trappings of a 21<sup>st</sup>-century American consumer-oriented society. As home to several Hasidic sects, including the Bobover, Belz, Satmar, Stolin Vizhnitz, Munkacz, Sprinka, Klausenberg, Gerer, and Pupa, Boro Park was a center of Jewish learning and devotion, with hundreds of synagogues and yeshivas, and a Yiddish-speaking community where the rich, poor, and working class could shop in high-priced and low-priced stores and buy kosher specialties from well-stocked supermarket shelves.</p><p>Boro Park, also spelled Borough Park, was a mainly rural part of south-central Brooklyn in the last years of the 19th century. One of the original settlers, Electus B. Litchfield, built a subdivision in 1887 and called it Blythebourne. In 1898 State Senator William H. Reynolds bought a tract of land abutting the east side of New Utrecht Avenue, extending from 43<sup>rd</sup> to 60<sup>th</sup> Streets. He called it Borough Park, and it eventually swallowed Blythebourne. All that remained of that name by the 21<sup>st</sup> century was Blythebourne Station, the local post office.</p><p>The first synagogue in the area was built in 1904 as Russian Jews, living in the teeming and overcrowded Lower East Side of Manhattan, trickled in to join Italian and Irish families in single-family attached houses. During the Brooklyn real-estate boom of the 1920s, the area thrived in a confluence of democratic trends.</p><p>After World War ii, the Italian and Irish families began moving out, and Jews who practiced a modern Orthodox faith spread to neighboring Flatbush and Midwood. For the Jewish community, it was the heyday of assimilation, when most were intent upon being inconspicuous. The Ḥasidim, practicing an 18th century form of ecstatic Judaism rich with ceremony and prayer, were different. Wearing beards and side curls, black hats and 19<sup>th</sup>-century suits and speaking Yiddish, the men stood out. The conservatively garbed women, in wigs and often pushing baby carriages, kept to themselves and their tight-knit families and friends. Many mainstream Jews found Ḥasidim, at first a tiny minority in New York, self-righteous, almost embarrassing, unsettling reminders of what these secular co-religionists once were. Tentatively, the Ḥasidic survivors clustered anew around the few rabbis who had survived the war.</p><p>One of the first Ḥasidic groups to move to Boro Park were the Skverer, who trace their roots to Chernobyl, Ukraine. Like other Ḥasidim, who practice an ecstatic brand of Judaism, each sect centers on a charismatic spiritual leader, often called a tzaddik, or righteous one, and on an individual's direct relationship with God. In 1922 Rabbi David Twersky was born in Kishinev, Russia, in a long line of distinguished rabbis. When he was 2, the family moved to the Lower East Side, where his father, Yitzchok, established a synagogue. Yitzchok later moved the synagogue to Williamsburg in Brooklyn and finally to 47<sup>th</sup> Street in Boro Park. David was 19 when his father died, and he took over the Skverer's leadership. Rabbi Twersky, who raised his sons as though they were in an East Europeanshtetl, aided many victims of the Holocaust in their efforts to emigrate to the United States. He also established a network of yeshivas, separately serving boys, girls, and married men, planting the Old World in the New World of Boro Park.</p><p>Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, a Holocaust survivor, nurtured the postwar rebirth of the Bobover sect, a group based in southeastern Poland that was nearly exterminated by the Nazis. He arrived in New York in the late 1940s, with only his oldest son. Much of his family had been killed. During this period, according to Samuel Heilman, a professor of Jewish studies and sociology at Queens College, the rabbi apparently had a crisis of faith, shaved his beard, and lost his desire to be a rabbi. But he soon recovered, and his change of heart proved inspirational to many Orthodox Jews coping with poverty and psychological distress in the wake of the war. His success in recruiting Jews in America to the Bobov sect was attributed to the fact that he was both nonconfrontational and charismatic. Under about 50 years of his conciliatory leadership, the Bobover became the leading Ḥasidic group in Boro Park, perhaps a third of all the Ḥasidim. The Bobovers tended to look to their grand rabbi more than most sects for advice on business, marriage, and family. Unlike the Satmars and Lubavitch, the Bobovers flourished with little public infighting. The main Bobov synagogue, on 48<sup>th</sup> Street between 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> Avenues, was known as Bobover Promenade. The Bobover, who like other Ḥasidism did not recognize the State of Israel, were conspicuously absent from Satmar-inspired anti-Israel rallies at the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/united-nations/united-nations">United Nations</a>, and the Bobover developed good relations with the more ambiguously Zionistic Klausenbergers and Belzers. Those two groups accepted educational stipends from the Israeli government.</p><p>As Boro Park became more Ḥasidic, the community's boundaries were considered to be between 12<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> Avenues and between 40<sup>th</sup> and 60<sup>th</sup> Streets. Its commercial center was 13<sup>th</sup> Avenue, with its aromatic bakeries, kosher pizzerias, and Judaica shops. But there were no video stores or national retail or food chains on the main shopping streets. The community flourished with the growth of Ḥasidism worldwide. Families grew, not only to follow the Biblical commandment to be fruitful and multiply but to replenish the post-Holocaust Jewish population. The fertility rate in Boro Park was double that of the city as a whole. Families with many children were common, and some had as many as 18 or 19. To accommodate the burgeoning population, homes expanded forward, backward, upward and even downward. In 1992 the city created a special zoning district in Boro Park so homeowners could legally build on 65% of their lot, and the footage for setbacks and rear yards was halved. From 1990 to 1998, the city's Building Department issued more permits, 822, for private construction projects of new homes and additions than in any other residential neighborhood of Brooklyn. Every other family was adding wings or floors just to keep pace with its growing brood. Sometimes wealthy families bought adjacent lots, razed row houses and built imposing single-family edifices from scratch. Others lived in a near-chronic state of renovation.</p><p>About 80% of the roughly 100,000 people were Jewish, according to estimates by Community Board 12 and local residents, early in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Pockets of Moslems, Italian, and Irish as well as Mexicans, Chinese, Pakistanis, Russians, and Poles also lived in Boro Park, which in the early years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century also encompassed parts of Bensonhurst, Kensington and Flatbush. The boundaries were determined to be 8<sup>th</sup> Avenue to 20<sup>th</sup> Avenue, and 37<sup>th</sup> to 62<sup>d</sup> Streets and Dahill Road.</p><p>Life in Boro Park was decidedly different from other parts of New York. At 8 a.m. every morning, an armada of yellow buses lined up to transport girls in long skirts and boys in curly earlocks to the 65 religious schools in the neighborhood. Many blocks had several synagogues, from hole-in-the-wall shtiebels to vast tiered synagogues, with a ceiling that reached three stories above long wood tables where clusters of boys and men pored over Hebrew texts late into the night. One synagogue, Shomre Shabos, was called the local minyan factory. From dawn until 1:30 a.m., quorums of 10 men shuffled in and about, arranging themselves in parallel lines, swaying back and forth in prayer.</p><p>Rich, poor, and working class lived side by side, praying together and sending their children to the same schools. The wealthy paid tuitions that supported the neighborhood's many religious schools and cobbled together a kind of private social service system, complete with group homes and a volunteer ambulance corps. There were perhaps 150 interest-free loan associations to help the needy. Every night, young men in worn black coats and hats knocked on the back doors of the larger homes seeking charity. Every Thursday afternoon, in a converted transit way station, dozens of students and volunteers packed hundreds of Sabbath charity boxes with eggs, milk, noodles, chickens, and kosher wine. By evening, 65 young men packed the boxes into cars and vans to drop on the doorsteps of the poor families.</p><p>From sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, all the shops – perhaps 400 – were closed (while the synagogues were full). A car that traversed the neighborhood on the Sabbath was looked on unkindly, and occasionally was stoned. After Shabbat and on Sunday, most residents shopped, strolled, and frequented kosher food shops like Mendel's 18<sup>th</sup> Avenue Pizza near 50<sup>th</sup> Street, where falafel, pirogies, or blintzes could be munched, Amnon's Kosher Pizza on 13<sup>th</sup> Avenue, the Donut Shop on 13<sup>th</sup> Avenue and 47<sup>th</sup> Street, where omelets and pancakes were also on the menu, and China Glatt, on 13<sup>th</sup> Avenue at 45<sup>th</sup> Street, one of the few nondairy restaurants. There were no bars on 13<sup>th</sup> Avenue and there were no parks in Boro Park.</p><p>[Stewart Kampel (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h4><a id="Upper_West_Side">Upper West Side</a></h4><p>Running diagonally across Manhattan, from the lower tip of Manhattan to the island's upper reaches, Broadway on the Upper West Side serves as the areas backbone and heart. Originally a Native American trail and built as Bloomingdale Road in 1703, Broadway, the widest street in the neighborhood, is a well-worn pathway to synagogues, famous food stores, Jewish cultural sites, and schools. With its parklike island, Broadway is also the communal front stoop, the place of serious and friendly networking, or schmoozing, among friends, neighbors, local politicians, and community leaders. The Upper West Side stretches from 59th to 110th Street, from Central Park West to Riverside Drive, and is sandwiched between two large city parks, Central Park and Riverside Park.</p><p>According to the Jewish Community Study of 2002, the Jewish population of the Upper West Side is 59,400 (the number of Jewish households is 37,100, with 71,800 people living in those households). Thirty percent of the households belong to a synagogue, with 14% affiliating with Orthodox, 25% with Conservative, and 28% with Reform; 16% identify as non-denominational and 13% as secular. One segment of the community is heavily committed to Jewish life, with 47% of neighborhood children having some day school education, and 64% having visited Israel. On the other hand, the intermarriage rate of 35% is slightly higher than the overall rate for Manhattan.</p><p>Although the Upper West Side does not have the largest Jewish population in Manhattan – there are more Jews living on the Upper East Side – the Upper West Side has much more of the distinctive feel of a Jewish neighborhood. Its streets are lined with kosher restaurants and food stores, supermarkets with kosher sections, Jewish bookstores and Judaica shops, schools – from Chabad to the first Reform day school in the country – and cultural institutions like Makor, a division of the 92<sup>nd</sup> St Y and the Jewish Community Council of Manhattan. Posters hung on street lamps and storefronts announce Jewish speakers and concerts. Its many synagogues range from grand to humble, with rich history behind them. Early mornings, it is not unusual to see people rushing off to shuls for the daily minyan (women too, as there are daily egalitarian services) and to the recently-built jcc for daily meditation.</p><p>But it is on Shabbat and holidays that the Jewish character of the neighborhood is most visible. Many families and individuals, dressed up to varying degrees, walk comfortably to the synagogues. An <i>eruv</i> strung around the neighborhood enables observant Jews to carry items on Shabbat and push baby carriages, activities otherwise not permitted.</p><p>The history of the neighborhood as a Jewish area is closely tied to the history of its synagogues. The neighborhood began to develop as a residential area after 1904, when the subway was constructed, connecting the West Side to midtown and Lower Manhattan. As the area became populated, several synagogues moved uptown, both following and leading their congregants, who moved from Lower Manhattan and points in between. Congregation Shearith Israel, the Spanish-Portuguese Synagogue – the oldest synagogue in New York, founded in 1654 – moved to its striking neoclassical building on Central Park West and 70<sup>th</sup> Street in 1897. Congregation B'nai Jeshurun – the first Ashkenazi synagogue in New York and the second oldest congregation, having broken from Shearith Israel in 1825 – moved to its Moorish Revival structure, on 88<sup>th</sup> Street between Broadway and West End, in 1918.</p><p>The Reform Rodeph Shalom, founded on the Lower East Side in 1842, moved to its Romanesque building on 83<sup>rd</sup> Street off Central Park West in 1930, from an intermediary building in the East 60s. In celebration of the synagogue's 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 1991, Rabbi Robert Levine and 75 congregants retraced the six-mile journey on foot, from Clinton Street, the site of its first building, to West 83<sup>rd</sup> Street.</p><p>Other synagogues in the area, like the Institutional Synagogue (now called the West Side Institutional Synagogue), on 76<sup>th</sup> Street off Columbus, and Ohab Zedek, on 95<sup>th</sup> Street off Columbus, moved to the area from Harlem.</p><p>The Jewish Center, a modern-Orthodox synagogue on West 86<sup>th</sup> Street, had its roots on the Upper West Side. Led by Rabbi Mordechai Kaplan, it was the first synagogue-center, founded in 1918 on the philosophy that cultural, recreational and religious activities be incorporated in one institution. When Rabbi Kaplan had disputes with the synagogue, he went on to found the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, one block east on 86<sup>th</sup> Street in 1922, which would become the first Reconstructionist synagogue.</p><p>All the synagogues were functioning in 2006.</p><p>In the years before and after World War ii, many European immigrants moved to the neighborhood, including refugees and Holocaust survivors. Clusters of Jews from Austria, Czechoslovakia, and also Iraq settled in the area, and brought a foreign flavor and accent to the restaurants and cafes. Many who came from European cities felt at home in the stately prewar apartment buildings along Broadway and West End Avenue, built in the similar styles to those they had left behind.</p><p>In the 1950s and 60s, new Jewish residents trickled in, while many Jews left the neighborhood for the suburbs and other places in the city. But in the late 1960s and 1970s, younger Jews began moving to the area; the <i>Havurah</i> movement, embracing small groups that met for study, prayer, and to observe life cycles, established a strong base on the West Side as progressive Jews, many influenced by the counter-culture movement, sought to create alternative, traditional communities based on egalitarianism. Members of groups like the New York <i>Havurah</i> sought new ways to reinvigorate ritual with meaning, much in the spirit of the highly successful <i>Jewish Catalog</i>, a best-selling book that found an audience among the baby-boom generation. Rejecting existing religious institutions, they favored participatory prayer in intimate settings, often meeting in members' homes. Many leaders of the <i>Havurah</i> community would go on to take leadership roles in the New York Jewish community decades later.</p><p>One such group began meeting at Ansche Chesed, a once thriving synagogue and community center with a substantial congregation at 100<sup>th</sup> Street and West End Avenue whose membership had dwindled, and helped bolster and revitalize that congregation. The synagogue and its community center were saved from planned destruction by a community effort that saw Montessori and another locally based, parent-run <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/day-care-center">day-care center</a> rent space in the complex. Since then, many Jewish and non-Jewish organizations and projects co-habitated and revitalized the "plant." That synagogue became a new model: a congregation made up of several lay-led services, going on simultaneously on Shabbat. Rabbi Michael Strassfeld, a co-editor of <i>The Jewish Catalog</i> (before he was ordained), was the first rabbinic leader of the reconstituted Ansche Chesed (and later would go on to lead the Society for the Advancement of Judaism).</p><p>At the same time as <i>Havurah</i> movement was getting under way, another significant development in Jewish life was unfolding about thirty blocks south. Under the leadership of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, Lincoln Square Synagogue, a modern-Orthodox institution, was founded in 1964; its members first met in the Lincoln Towers complex before erecting their own building in 1970, with an unusual sanctuary-in-the-round. Rabbi Riskin drew young, professional and single people to the new synagogue, delivering weeknight talks on popular topics like relationships, with Torah underpinnings, to overflow audiences. The synagogue became a meeting spot for Jewish singles, many of whom stayed in the area after marrying. In 1983, Rabbi Riskin and his family, along with several Lincoln Square families, moved to Israel and settled in Efrat, where he served as chief rabbi and headed several educational institutions.</p><p>In subsequent years, the Lincoln Square population aged, and the center of young Orthodox Jewish single life moved north, to several synagogues in the West 80s and 90s.</p><p>Rabbi Sally Priesand, American's first female rabbi, who served the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue for several years beginning in 1972, and Rabbi Marshall Meyer, who died in 1993, made significant contributions to Jewish life in the area. Rabbi Meyer, after spending 25 years in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/south-american-political-geography/buenos-aires">Buenos Aires</a> and founding Jewish institutions there, returned to New York in 1985 and spearheaded the revival of B'nai Jeshurun. Its Friday night services, filled with music, singing, and spirited prayer, attracted more than a thousand individuals, including many young people. The synagogue was nondenominational, having broken with the Conservative movement over the issue of gay ordination. Committed to social action, B'nai Jeshurun became a sought-after model for synagogues around the country.</p><p>In 1991, after its roof collapsed, the congregation of B'nai Jeshurun was invited by its neighbors on West 86<sup>th</sup> Street, the Church of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/st-paul">St. Paul</a> and St. Andrew, to hold services in their sanctuary. Together, congregants of the two institutions created a large banner, with the words of Psalm 133: "How good it is when brothers and sisters dwell together in harmony." It hangs at the front of the church. Even after the synagogue roof was repaired, the congregation continued to use the church on Shabbat mornings and holidays, having outgrown the synagogue space.</p><p>Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, the descendent of a German rabbinical family, was known internationally for his neo-Ḥasidic musical style, deep and joyful spirituality and extensive outreach. In his final years, he was based on the Upper West Side, at the Carlebach Shul on West 79<sup>th</sup> Street. He died in 1994, and the Orthodox congregation continued his tradition of welcoming people from all backgrounds.</p><p>Although Lincoln Square Synagogue was the last Upper West Side synagogue to construct a new building, several new congregations were founded without buildings and used the facilities of schools and community centers. These minyan groups stressed community and took prayer seriously; their services were traditional and experimental, not necessarily defined by denominational boundaries.</p><p>Along with synagogues of every denomination, there were "beginner's services" in various synagogues as well as smaller congregations known as shtiblach, usually named for the rabbi who led them, and located in brownstones on the side streets. The area also had a Chabad and other Ḥasidic presence: it was not uncommon to see men walking on Shabbat in traditional shtreimels and bekeshes, long black tailored coats.</p><p>There was fluidity among the congregations, with some people belonging to several institutions at once, others who attended services in different places, and people who moved from synagogue to synagogue. In the years before 9/11, when there were fewer security concerns, synagogues jointly held outdoor Simchat Torah celebrations, with dancing in the streets, and some returned to the practice as tensions eased. The synagogues and minyan groups convened together for Yom HaShoah commemorations. On the first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish community is out in force. It gathers on the walkway above the banks of the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/hudson-river">Hudson River</a> for the ceremony of <i>Tashlikh</i>, casting breadcrumbs into the water and reciting verses from Scripture relating to repentance. It is one of the more colorful scenes of city life, with fashionably dressed women, men in new suits, and some in more casual clothing exchanging greetings of the new year.</p><p>Some of the synagogues featured soup kitchens and operated shelters for the homeless. Some housed nursery and afternoon schools.</p><p>A neighborhood landmark that drew shoppers as well as tourists, Zabar's was a long-running family business on Broadway, featuring traditional Jewish specialties along with other food, fancy and plain. Barney Greengrass, an appetizing store and café on Amsterdam Avenue, was famous for its smoked fish, and Murray's, on Broadway, was a neighborhood favorite for similar fare. The dairy restaurants of decades ago, where neighborhood habitués like Isaac Bashevis Singer – the Nobel laureate who had a section of West 86<sup>th</sup> Street named in his honor – are no more. They gave way to kosher steak houses, sushi bars, pizza shops, and places that served Moroccan, Yemenite, and other ethnic food.</p><p>On any given evening on the Upper West Side, it was possible to hear Jewish music, attend a kosher cooking class, or study Jewish texts, listen to a Jewish author read from a new work, participate in a healing service, or sit in on a panel discussion on Jewish issues of the day. That tradition was likely to continue.</p><p>[Sandee Brawarsky (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h4><a id="Washington_Heights">Washington Heights</a></h4><p>With its hills and parks overlooking the Hudson and Harlem Rivers, Washington Heights at the northern end of Manhattan proved especially attractive to European immigrants. The Heights was one of the last parts of the island to be settled. Before World War i, the areas east of Broadway and south of 181<sup>st</sup> Street became an urban neighborhood, but the more affluent areas to the north and west were settled mainly in the 1920s and 1930s. Virtually all the neighborhood housing consisted of five- and six-story brick apartment houses.</p><p>The first Jews in Washington Heights were mainly immigrants from Eastern Europe and their children who moved to the Heights from the Lower East Side or from neighboring Harlem, especially in the 1920s and 1930s. A number of institutions that were founded in Harlem moved north with their followers and constituents. Although located in Manhattan, Washington Heights resembled Jewish areas of second settlement in the Bronx and Brooklyn more than other parts of its own borough. Jews never made up a majority of the population, though they were probably between 35 and 40% of the total. Other ethnic groups included persons of Irish, Greek, and Armenian background. Washington Heights was considered a prestigious middle-class area, and in 1928 Yeshiva University relocated to Amsterdam Avenue in Washington Heights precisely because of the prestige of the address. The Moorish building of the university's main building became the nucleus of a campus that sprawled over a number of blocks on the eastern end of the neighborhood between 184<sup>th</sup> and 187<sup>th</sup> Street.</p><p>In the late 1930s the Jewish community was reinforced by a large influx of German-speaking Jews fleeing the Nazis. In all, 20,000 to 25,000 German-speaking Jews settled in, constituting about 40% of the Jewish population. Although Washington Heights was the home of the largest concentration of German Jewish escapees from Nazi Germany, its residents were not typical of the overall wave of German Jewish immigrants of the 1930s. Those in Washington Heights were atypical in their greater religious traditionalism, their overwhelmingly South German and often rural background, and their relatively modest socioeconomic and education levels. Though more "bourgeois" than most immigrants to the United States, the German Jews of Washington Heights bore little resemblance to the famous "intellectual immigrants" of the 1930s.</p><p>Most of the newcomers arrived between 1938 and 1940. Some moved to Washington Heights immediately. Others joined them. In the late 1930s, the newcomers began to build a network of institutions and give the neighborhood a German Jewish atmosphere. Social clubs and places of entertainment played an important role in the life of the community until about 1950, although many German Jews also found culture and entertainment outside of Washington Heights. After World War ii German Jewish institutional life in the neighborhood was concentrated in the numerous immigrant synagogues founded between 1935 and 1949. Besides a dozen congregations organized by the immigrants themselves, there were several pre-existing synagogues in which they gained a majority and heavily influenced the congregational atmosphere. The synagogues influenced by German Jews in Washington Heights stretched across a broad spectrum, from the Reform Hebrew Tabernacle to right-wing Orthodox congregations.</p><p>Most of the synagogues followed Orthodox forms, though in some of them strictly observant Jews were in the minority. The largest German Jewish congregation in Washington Heights was K'hal Adath Jeshurun, founded in 1938 by former members of the separatist Orthodox community of Frankfurt, which had once been headed by <a data-article="391878" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hirsch-samson-ben-raphael">Samson Raphael *Hirsch</a>. The congregation was called Breuer's, after its first rabbi, <a data-article="356110" href="/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/breuer-joseph">Joseph *Breuer</a> (1882–1980), <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/judaism-biographies/samson-raphael-hirsch">Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>'s grandson. The Breuer community established an all-encompassing European-style communal structure highly unusual for the United States. Besides its large synagogue, social hall, and burial society, it had its own <i>kashrut</i> supervision, <i>mikveh</i>, school system from <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/nursery-school">nursery school</a> through postgraduate yeshivah, synagogue newspaper (<i>Mitteilungen</i>), and charitable and women's groups. Most of the other German synagogues in the neighborhood were also large and formal, often with several cantors, a choir, and an involved institutional structure.</p><p>Although German Jews were far from a majority of the population of Washington Heights, the German Jewish character of the neighborhood was evident in many subtle ways. Many of the immigrants spoke German at home and on the street, even after they learned some English, although the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/language-and-linguistics/german">German language</a> was almost never used in shop signs or public notices. German was also used in synagogue sermons and bulletins well into the 1960s. From the mid-1950s to the early 1970s, there was a slow transition to English after which German disappeared from every official capacity in synagogue life, though individual congregants sometimes continued conversing in German.</p><p>German Jewish culture was also evident in the conservative styles of dress and formalism in interpersonal behavior. German immigrants could often be seen sitting on benches in the park or standing in groups on the sidewalk conversing quietly in German. Some sat for hours over a cup of coffee in local restaurants talking about the olden days. As a sophisticated and educated group, many German Jews brought their libraries of <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/literature-other-modern-languages/german-literature/german-literature">German literature</a> with them and attended classical concerts in other parts of the city. Even synagogue social events sometimes included classical music. These interests in high culture were not nearly as common among the many rural Jews who settled in Washington Heights. In general the immigrants who came to Washington Heights had a far stronger Jewish identity and more intense Jewish religious practice than German Jews who settled in other neighborhoods. Most severed their sense of connection to Germany after World War ii. Though some residents of Washington Heights made occasional visits to Germany, to visit the graves of their relatives, see their hometowns, or do business, a larger number visited Israel, with which they had a far closer emotional tie.</p><p>Like most other immigrants, the great majority of the German Jews of Washington Heights sent their children to public schools, where they rapidly became acculturated to the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/language-and-linguistics/english">English language</a> as well as American political and cultural values. Most gave their children some supplemental Jewish education in synagogue Hebrew schools, though a growing proportion of the Orthodox minority sent their children to Jewish day schools. The American-born generation had little identification with the German culture of their parents, rarely learned German, and almost never spoke it to one another. They also rejected many of the cultural values of their parents, especially what they considered the older generation's formality and rigidity. Members of the second generation saw themselves as American Jews whose German background was only a small part of their identities.</p><p>The children of the immigrants generally did well economically and educationally. Unlike most of their parents, they went on to higher education and entered the professions. Probably more than half married outside the German Jewish community (but generally not outside the Jewish community). As they grew up and succeeded, most of the children of the immigrants moved away from Washington Heights to the suburbs or more prestigious neighborhoods in New York. Some of the more successful of the immigrants also moved away.</p><p>The overall ethnic makeup of Washington Heights underwent a slow but thoroughgoing change. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, blacks and Hispanics began moving in large numbers into the southern sections of Washington Heights, which soon became merely a part of Harlem. In the 1960s and 1970s people of color slowly became the majority of the population of all of Washington Heights, except a small section of northwest Washington Heights near Fort Tryon Park. Most of the white residents moved away, though German Jewish outmigration may have been a bit slower than the "flight" of other white groups. Washington Heights became a primarily Hispanic neighborhood populated mostly by people from the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/caribbean-political-geography/dominican-republic">Dominican Republic</a>. The shops and institutions catered mainly to the new population, with many signs in the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/language-and-linguistics/spanish">Spanish language</a>. The social prestige of the neighborhood declined as crime and drug trafficking increased.</p><p>As they became more and more of a minority in the neighborhood, the remaining Jews organized to defend their stake in the area. They ran candidates for the local school board, organized a safety patrol, settled recently arrived Soviet Jews in the neighborhood, and created a Jewish neighborhood council. This council was dominated by the Breuer community, whose role among Jews became ever greater. Unlike other congregations, the Breuer was able to retain a considerable portion of its American-born generations within the neighborhood.</p><p>By the late 1980s, the German Jews of Washington Heights were an aging and shrinking community mainly huddled in one part of western Washington Heights. Most of their synagogues closed, moved, or merged, many German Jewish stores and food shops closed, and the German Jewishness of the community became less and less apparent. Besides the remnant of the German Jewish immigrant community, the main Jewish elements that remained were the campus of Yeshiva University and the Russian-speaking recent arrivals, neither of whom interacted very much with the German Jews.</p><p>The "decline" of Washington Heights began to be reversed in the late 1990s and thereafter. Two groups of young people began to move into the neighborhood. The first consisted mainly of Orthodox Jewish singles and young couples, often studying at, or recently graduated from, Yeshiva University. They tended to live near the campus in the eastern part of the neighborhood or on Bennett Avenue near the Breuer synagogue. Few of them were of German-Jewish background and most stayed in the area only a few years, but they did give a boost to the German Jews who had remained. The second group consisted of upwardly mobile young professionals attracted by the area's closeness to midtown Manhattan and its picturesque views of the Hudson River. Some of these newcomers were Jews but they rarely showed much interest for the Jewish culture of the neighborhood. They tended to live in co-ops or condominiums on the streets bordering the Hudson River south of Fort Tryon Park, an area that real estate agents began to call "Hudson Heights" to distinguish it from the rest of the neighborhood. This new population brought with it many of the features of gentrification of poor neighborhoods, including finer restaurants and cultural events. By the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, real estate values in the area began to skyrocket. The remaining German Jews, in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, who had come to America as children or adolescents, were now mostly in their 80s or even older. Whether the Jews ever return in large numbers remains to be seen.</p><p>[Steven Lowenstein (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h4><a id="Williamsburg">Williamsburg</a></h4><p>Three bridges unite the boroughs of Manhattan with Brooklyn – the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/brooklyn-bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>, the Manhattan Bridge, and the Williamsburg Bridge. After it opened in 1903, the Williamsburg was nicknamed Jews' Highway because it drew immigrants from the teeming Lower East Side to the south Brooklyn neighborhood adjoining the East River. Served by trolley cars and an elevated subway line, Williamsburg became one of New York's major Jewish communities in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>Williamsburgh (the h was later dropped) was first incorporated as a village in 1827, but its history goes back to 1638, when the Dutch West India Company purchased the land from Canarsie Indians. A period of squatting by farmers of various nationalities followed. It did not become a major residential area until 1803, when a real-estate investor, Richard Woodhull, purchased 13 acres of land, to be surveyed by his friend, Jonathan Williams, a grandnephew of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/benjamin-franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> who planned and built most of the forts in New York Harbor. Williamsburg would later be named in Williams' honor.</p><p>Woodhull and Williams intended the area to be a residential alternative to Manhattan, accessible by ferry. Williamsburg became a city in 1827, with new docks, shipyards, and other businesses that profited from proximity to New York's port. The New York Navy Yard, colloquially known as the Brooklyn Navy Yard, was opened in 1801 and employed 6,000 men by the start of the Civil War. By the 1850s, Williamsburg had grown into a suburban-style city, with 31,000 people, and it was home to resorts, farms, distilleries, and breweries. It later became part of the city of Brooklyn, which joined New York City in 1898. The availability of jobs drew immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Germany, and England.</p><p>The character of Williamsburg would change dramatically, though, when the Williamsburg Bridge, built to relieve traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge, caused the displacement of almost 20,000 people and the destruction of their property. With Williamsburg linked to the Lower East Side, farms, resorts and mansions gave way to multiple-unit dwellings to accommodate the waves of immigrants. By the 1920s, the population exceeded 250,000, and the area was one of the most densely populated regions of the country.</p><p>In 1938, the growing need for public housing led to the first federal housing project in the nation, the Williamsburg Houses. The project, which cost about $12 million, accommodated 1,622 low-income families in 20 four-story apartment houses. These buildings were the forerunner of a series of low-income and middle-income subsidized housing in the borough and the city. Completed near the end of the Depression, the projects, as they were known, provided clean and fresh apartments for civil servants, small-business owners and others, regardless of religion, and were an oasis of greenery in an area of small, largely dilapidated wood-frame housing. Almost 70 years later, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the projects continued to provide low-rent accommodations to a changing population. The working class influx also fueled an industrial boom, and Williamsburg became a center of manufacturing until a decline in the 1950s.</p><p>After World War ii, the area was host to the renaissance of the Satmar Ḥasidic sect, which was nearly obliterated by the Nazis, and a majority of Jews living in the neighborhood today are Ḥasidim. The New York Jewish Population Survey of 2002 estimated that 57,600 Jews lived in Williamsburg, 40,000 of them Ḥasidic. In 2006, the Satmar, the men distinctive by their long black coats and <i>shtreimels</i>, or fur hats, and the women by their conservative dress and wigs and turbans as head coverings, was believed to be the world's largest Ḥasidic sect with 100,000 adherents. The name Satmar comes from the Romanian Satu Mare, or large village. Members of the Pupa, Wien, and Klausenberger sects, named for the areas of Europe from which they emigrated, also had a presence in Williamsburg.</p><p>The explosion of Williamsburg Ḥasidic life began in 1946 with the arrival of the Satmar Grand Rebbe, Joel Teitelbaum, who escaped from Nazi-occupied Hungary and the Bergen-Belsen <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/crime-and-law-enforcement/concentration-camp">concentration camp</a>. The community thrived, founding an extensive network of synagogues and yeshivas and organizations like Bikur Cholim, providing help and support for the sick and needy. Overcrowding led followers to establish a satellite community, Kiryas Joel, in Orange County, ny. During the 1950s and subsequent decades Williamsburg's Jews ran the gamut of religious observance and affiliation, but the non-Ḥasidic population gradually declined. When Rabbi Teitelbaum died in 1979, his nephew, Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum, formerly known as the Sigeter Rebbe, succeeded him. Since 1999, the sect has been engulfed in conflict after Rabbi Teitelbaum named his younger son, Zalman, to lead the central Satmar synagogue, Yetev Lev Bikur Cholim, bypassing his eldest son, Aaron, whose followers were mostly in Kiryas Joel. Factions supporting both brothers battled for years in court, and occasionally on the streets, where their clashes prompted a police response.</p><p>Bedford Avenue, with historic brownstones in tip-top condition, was one of the leafier enclaves of Jewish Williamsburg, and was along the route of the annual New York City Marathon. Although they rarely ventured out of their life of study and religious practice, it was not unusual to see the Ḥasidim cheering on the runners and providing refreshments during the race. On one particularly hot day, the Ḥasidim sprayed runners with seltzer, adding to the color of the race. The shopping strip on Lee Avenue had a distinctive Jewish flavor, with decades-old businesses flourishing under signs in Yiddish and English, and restaurants and take-out stores filling the air with the scent of kosher food. Children were everywhere, an average of about eight to a family. By the early years of the century, new grand synagogues were being built by the Satmar, while a few modern Orthodox congregations, like Beth Jacob Ohev Sholom on Rodney Street, persisted.</p><p>Beneath the surface of the bustling and thriving community, however, was the reality that Williamsburg harbored one of the poorest Jewish communities in the United States, with an estimated 59 percent living below the poverty line and eligible for government services like food stamps and subsidized housing. Many large families lived in cramped apartments, and it was not uncommon to find bathtubs doubling as beds. Some of the members of the sect supported their families by working in the diamond district in Manhattan, but more commonly the men studied or worked in yeshivahs as teachers, which for many was a calling. Some also earned a kollel, or stipend, for learning. The community itself also provided free food for Shabbat.</p><p>Jews were not the only large ethnic group in the neighborhood. Spanish-speaking Latinos or Puerto Ricans had congregated in the area following the end of World War ii and the need for affordable housing caused stress between the groups. This conflict required regular intervention and mediation by public officials. In 1997, during the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the groups agreed to place proceeds from the sale of city-owned property into a housing fund that would benefit both communities. Amid the conflict, Jews and Hispanics found much common ground, fighting the closing of fire stations and opposing possible environmental hazards like a proposed incinerator on the site of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (since defeated) and hazardous lead paint falling from the Williamsburg Bridge. The area had one of the highest incidences of asthma in the city. Jews and Hispanics joined to address the influx of artists and others fleeing the exorbitant rents of Manhattan studios and apartments. They were drawn to old commercial lofts that the city rezoned for residential use in 1985. Their presence led to the opening of galleries, museums, live-music night clubs, cafes and restaurants and an avant-garde branch of the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/museum-modern-art">Museum of Modern Art</a>. The Hasidim, who shun secular culture, called on members of their community to avoid renting to the artists. Both groups feared that they would be priced out of their own neighborhood if developers catered to the newcomers and that the rezoning they fought for to create affordable housing would be exploited for profit. The newcomers, however, helped to stabilize and revive the over-all neighborhood.</p><p>In the early 1950s, low-income Williamsburg was the scene of a sweeping transformation when the city planner Robert Moses designed the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to pass through the neighborhood, cutting it in half and leaving the western segment between the highway and the East River, a destination for poor immigrants, in decline. Some 5,000 people were displaced, and numerous homes and businesses were condemned by <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/law/eminent-domain">eminent domain</a> to clear space for the project. Many later attributed the area's high asthma rate to exhaust from the heavy expressway traffic. The Brooklyn Navy Yard was decommissioned in 1966, although it was sold to New York City and later became a major industrial park, with over 200 business tenants and 3,500 employees.</p><p>In addition to rabbinic councils and charities, the area's Jewish community was served by the United Jewish Organizations, an umbrella group affiliated with the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty and the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. Led for many years by Rabbi David Niederman, the organization lobbied for and administered government funding and acted as liaison with public officials. Jewish leaders played a significant role in charting the future of the neighborhood.</p><p>In May, 2005, Mayor <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> and the City Council approved a plan to rezone the North Side of Williamsburg and Greenpoint for residence and a waterfront park as well as luxury high-rises. The population of the area could increase by 40,000. The plan also aimed to attract top-name retailers. Critics lamented that the plan did nothing to return the thousands of lost manufacturing jobs to the neighborhood, which dropped from a peak of 93,000 in 1961 to fewer than 12,000 in 2006. They also feared that the city would not be able to improve transportation and safety in the area, and that it would make Williamsburg more like Manhattan.</p><p>[Adam Dickter (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.)]</p><h2>bibliography:</h2><p>1654–1870; D. and T. de Sola Pool, <i>An Old Faith in the New World</i> (1955); D. de Sola Pool, <i>Portraits Etched in Stone</i> (1953); L.

New York's width is about 320 mi (515 km) e-w, not including <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/long-island">Long Island</a>, which extends an additional 118 mi (190 km) sw-ne; the state's maximum n-s extension is about 310 mi (499 km). New York State is shaped roughly like a right triangle: the line from the extreme ne to the extreme sw forms the hypotenuse, with New York City as the right angle.</p><p>Mainland New York is bordered on the nw and n by the Canadian provinces of Ontario (with the boundary line passing through <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-ontario">Lake Ontario</a> and the St. Lawrence River) and Quebec; on the e by Vermont (with part of the line passing through <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-champlain">Lake Champlain</a> and the Poultney River), Massachusetts, and Connecticut; on the s by the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/atlantic-ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> (part of the line passes through the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/hudson-river">Hudson River</a>), and Pennsylvania (partly through the Delaware River); and on the w by Pennsylvania (with the line extending into <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-erie">Lake Erie</a>) and Ontario (through <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-erie">Lake Erie</a> and the Niagara River).</p><p>Two large islands lie off the state's se corner. <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/long-island">Long Island</a> is bounded by Connecticut (through Long Island Sound) to the n, Rhode Island (through the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/atlantic-ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>) to the ne, the Atlantic to the s, and the East River and the Narrows to the w. Staten Island (a borough of New York City) is separated from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> by Newark Bay in the n, Raritan Bay in the s, and Arthur Kill channel in the w, and from Long Island by the Narrows to the e. Including these two islands, the total boundary length of New York State is 1,430 mi (2,301 km). Long Island, with an area of 1,396 sq mi (3,616 sq km), is the largest island belonging to one of the 48 coterminous states.</p><p>The state's geographic center is in Madison County, 12 mi (19 km) s of Oneida.</p><h2>TOPOGRAPHY</h2><p>Two upland regions<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/adirondack-mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a> and the Appalachian Highlands<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>dominate the topography of New York State.</p><p>The Adirondacks cover most of the northeast and occupy about one-fourth of the state's total area. The Appalachian Highlands, including the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/catskill-mountains">Catskill Mountains</a> and Kittatinny Mountain Ridge (or Shawangunk Mountains), extend across the southern half of the state, from the Hudson River Valley to the basin of Lake Erie. Between these two upland regions, and also along the state's northern and eastern borders, lies a network of lowlands, including the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/great-lakes">Great Lakes</a> Plain; the Hudson, Mohawk, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, and St. Lawrence valleys; and the coastal areas of New York City and Long Island.</p><p>The state's highest peaks are found in the Adirondacks: Mt. Marcy, 5,344 feet (1,629 meters), and Algonquin Peak, 5,114 feet (1,559 meters). The mean elevation of the state is approximately 1,000 ft (305 m). Nestled among the Adirondacks are many scenic lakes, including Lake Placid, Saranac Lake, and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-george">Lake George</a>. The region is also the source of the Hudson and Ausable rivers. The Adirondack Forest Preserve covers much of this terrain, and both public and private lakes are mainly for recreational use.</p><p>The highest peak in the Catskills is Slide Mountain, at 4,204 feet (1,281 meters). Lesser upland regions of New York include the Hudson Highlands, projecting into the Hudson Valley; the Taconic Range, along the state's eastern border; and Tug Hill Plateau, set amid the lowlands just west of the Adirondacks.</p><p>Three lakes<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>Erie, Ontario, and Champlain<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>form part of the state's borders. The state has jurisdiction over 594 sq mi (1,538 sq km) of Lake Erie and 3,033 sq mi (7,855 sq km) of Lake On-tario. New York contains some 8,000 lakes; the largest lake wholly within the state is Oneida, about 22 mi (35 km) long, with a maximum width of 6 mi (10 km) and an area of 80 sq mi (207 sq km). Many smaller lakes are found in the Adirondacks and in the Finger Lakes region in west-central New York, renowned for its vineyards and great natural beauty. The 11 Finger Lakes themselves (including Owasco, Cayuga, Seneca, Keuka, Canadaigua, and Skaneateles) are long and narrow, fanning southward from a line that runs roughly from Syracuse westward to Geneseo. Sea level at the Atlantic Ocean is the lowest elevation of the state.</p><p>New York's longest river is the Hudson, extending from the Adirondacks to New York Bay for a distance of 306 mi (492 km). The Mohawk River flows into the Hudson north of Albany. The major rivers of central and western New York State<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the Black, Genesee, and Oswego<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>all flow into <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-ontario">Lake Ontario</a>. Rivers defining the state's borders are the St. Lawrence in the north, the Poultney in the east, the Delaware in the southeast, and the Niagara in the west. Along the Niagara River, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/niagara-falls">Niagara Falls</a> forms New York's most spectacular natural feature. The falls, with an estimated mean flow rate of more than 1,585,000 gallons (60,000 hectoliters) per second, are both a leading tourist attraction and a major source of <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/computers-and-electrical-engineering/electrical-engineering/hydroelectric">hydroelectric power</a>.</p><p>About 2 billion years ago, New York State was entirely covered by a body of water that periodically rose and fell. The Adirondacks and Hudson River Palisades were produced by undersea volcanic action during this Grenville period. At about the same time, the schist and other crystalline rock that lie beneath Manhattan were formed. The Catskills were worn down by erosion from what was once a high, level plain. Glaciers from the last <a class="interlinked" href="/earth-and-environment/geology-and-oceanography/geology-and-oceanography/ice-age">Ice Age</a> carved out the inland lakes and valleys and determined the surface features of Staten Island and Long Island.</p><h2>CLIMATE</h2><p>Although New York lies entirely within the humid continental zone, there is much variation from region to region. The three main climatic regions are the southeastern lowlands, which have the warmest temperatures and the longest season between frosts; the uplands of the Catskills and Adirondacks, where winters are cold and summers cool; and the snow belt along the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/great-lakes">Great Lakes</a> Plain, one of the snowiest areas of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/united-states">United States</a>. The growing (frost-free) season ranges from 100 to 120 days in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and higher elevations of the hills of southwestern New York to 180-200 days on Long Island.</p><p>Among the major population centers, New York City has an annual average temperature of 55<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (12<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c), with a normal maximum of 63<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (17<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c) and a normal minimum of 47<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (8<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c). Albany has an annual average of 48<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (8<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c), with a normal maximum of 58<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (14<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c) and a normal minimum of 37<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (2<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c). The average in Buffalo is 48<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (8<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c), the normal maximum 57<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (13<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c), and the normal minimum 40<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (4<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c). The record low temperature for the state is <span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2212;</span>52<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2212;</span>47<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c), recorded at Stillwater Reservoir in the Adirondacks on 9 February 1934 and at Old Forge on 18 February 1979; the record high is 108<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>f (42<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#xB0;</span>c), registered at Troy on 22 July 1926.</p><p>Annual precipitation ranges from over 50 in (127 cm) in the higher elevations to about 30 in (76 cm) in the areas near Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, and in the lower half of the Genesee River Valley. New York City has an average annual precipitation of 46.7 in (118 cm), with an average annual snowfall of 28 in (71 cm); Albany receives an average annual precipitation of 35.7 in (90 cm); and Buffalo, 38.3 in (97 cm). In the snow belt, Buffalo receives 91 in (231 cm) of snow. Rochester averages 89 in (218 cm), and Syracuse 114 in (289 cm). New York City has fewer days of precipitation than other major populated areas (120 days annually, compared with 168 for Buffalo). Buffalo is the windiest city in the state, with a mean hourly wind speed of about 12 mph (19 km/hr). Tornadoes are rare, but hurricanes and tropical storms sometimes cause heavy damage to Long Island.</p><h2>FLORA AND FAUNA</h2><p>New York has some 150 species of trees. Post and willow oak, laurel magnolia, sweet gum, and hop trees dominate the Atlantic shore areas, while oak, hickory, and chestnut thrive in the Hudson and Mohawk valleys and the Great Lakes Plain. Birch, beech, basswood, white oak, and commercially valuable maple are found on the Appalachian Plateau and in the foothills of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/adirondack-mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a>. The bulk of the Adirondacks and Catskills is covered with red and black spruce, <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/plants/plants/balsam-fir">balsam fir</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/plants/plants/mountain-ash">mountain ash</a>, as well as white pine and maple. Spruce, <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/plants/plants/balsam-fir">balsam fir</a>, paper birch, and <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/plants/plants/mountain-ash">mountain ash</a> rise to the timberline while only the hardiest plant species grow above it. Larch, mulberry, locust, and several kinds of willow are among the many varieties that have been introduced throughout the state. Apple trees and other fruit-bearing species are important in western New York and the Hudson Valley.</p><p>Common meadow flowers include several types of rose (the state flower), along with dandelion, Queen Anne's lace, golden-rod, and <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/plants/plants/black-eyed-susan">black-eyed Susan</a>. Wild sarsaparilla, Solomon's seal, Indian pipe, bunchberry, and goldthread flourish amid the forests. Cattails grow in profusion along the Hudson, and rushes cover the Finger Lakes shallows. Among protected plants are all species of fern, bayberry, lotus, all native orchids, five species of rhododendron (including azalea), and trillium. Five plant species were listed as threatened or endangered in 2006, including the sandplain gerardia, American hart's tongue fern, and Leedy's roseroot.</p><p>Some 600 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles are found in New York, of which more than 450 species are common. Mammals in abundance include many mouse species, the snowshoe hare, common and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-england">New England</a> cottontails, wood-chuck, squirrel, muskrat, and raccoon. The deer population has been estimated at as many as 500,000, making them a pest causing millions of dollars annually in crop damage. The wolverine, elk, and moose were all wiped out during the 19th century, and the otter, mink, marten, and fisher populations were drastically reduced; but the beaver, nearly eliminated by fur trappers, had come back strongly by 1940.</p><p>More than 260 bird species have been observed. The most common year-round residents are the crow, hawk, and several types of woodpecker. Summer visitors are many, and include the bluebird (the state bird). The wild turkey, which disappeared during the 19th century, was successfully reestablished in the 1970s. The house (or English) sparrow has been in New York since its introduction in the 1800s.</p><p>The common toad, newt, and several species of frog and salamander inhabit New York waters. Garter snakes, water snakes, grass snakes, and milk snakes are common; rattlesnakes formerly thrived in the Adirondacks. There are 210 known species of fish; 130 species are found in the Hudson, 120 in the Lake Ontario was
tershed. Freshwater fish include species of perch, bass, pike, and trout (the state fish). Oysters, clams, and several saltwater fish species are found in Long Island Sound. Of insect varieties, the praying mantis is looked upon as a friend (since it eats insects that prey on crops and trees) while the <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/animals/zoology-invertebrates/gypsy-moth">gypsy moth</a> has been singled out as an enemy in periodic state-run pest-control programs.</p><p>In April 2006, twenty animal species (vertebrates and invertebrates) were classified by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as threatened or endangered, including the Indiana bat, Karner blue butterfly, piping plover, <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/animals/vertebrate-zoology/bald-eagle">bald eagle</a>, shortnose sturgeon, three species of whale, and five species of turtle.</p><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</h2><p>New York was one of the first states to mount a major conservation effort. In the 1970s, well over $1 billion was spent to reclaim the state from the ravages of pollution. State conservation efforts date back at least to 1885, when a forest preserve was legally established in the Adirondacks and Catskills. Adirondack Park was created in 1892, Catskill Park in 1904. Then, as now, the issue was how much if any state forestland would be put to commercial use. Timber cutting in the forest preserve was legalized in 1893, but the constitution of 1895 forbade the practice. By the late 1930s, the state had spent more than $16 million on land purchases and controlled 2,159,795 acres (874,041 hectares) in the Adirondacks and some 230,000 acres (more than 93,000 hectares) in the Catskills. The constitutional revision of 1894 expressly outlawed the sale, removal, or destruction of timber on forestlands. That requirement was modified by constitutional amendment in 1957 and 1973, however, and the state is now permitted to sell forest products from the preserves in limited amounts.</p><p>All state environmental programs are run by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), established in 1970. The department oversees pollution control programs, monitors environmental quality, manages the forest preserves, and administers fish and wildlife laws (including the issuance of hunting and fishing licenses). The state's national parks totaled 35,914 acres (14,534 hectares). State parks and recreational areas totaled 258,000 acres (104,000 hectares). Wetlands covered 2.5 million acres of the state as of 2000. About one-half of the 160 species identified as endangered or threatened by the Department of Environmental Conservation are wetlands-dependent.</p><p>The chief air-quality problem areas are Buffalo, where levels of particles (especially from the use of coke in steelmaking) are high, and New York City, where little progress has been made in cutting <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/carbon-monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> emissions from motor vehicles. Despite air-quality efforts, <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/environmental-studies/acid-rain">acid rain</a> has been blamed for killing fish and trees in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and other areas. In 1984, the legislature passed the first measure in the nation designed to reduce <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/environmental-studies/acid-rain">acid rain</a>, calling for a cut of 12% in <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/sulfur-dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> emissions by 1988 and further reductions after that. In 2000, the state legislature passed the Air Pollution Mitigation Law, which penalized New York utilities for selling <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/sulfur-dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> allowances other states; the law was overturned in April 2002, when a federal district court ruled that the law both restricted interstate commerce and was preempted by the federal <a class="interlinked" href="/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/clean-air-act">Clean Air Act</a>. In 2003, 44 million lb of toxic chemicals were released in the state.</p><p>Before the 1960s, the condition of New York's waters was a national scandal. Raw sewage, arsenic, cyanide, and heavy metals were regularly dumped into the state's lakes and rivers, and fish were rapidly dying off. Two Pure Waters Bond Acts during the 1960s, the Environmental Quality Bond Act of 1972, and a state fishery program have helped reverse the damage. The state has also taken action against corporate polluters, including a $7-million settlement with General Electric over that company's discharge of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Hudson. In addition, the state and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts-28">federal government</a> spent perhaps $45 million between 1978 and 1982 on the cleanup of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/love-canal">Love Canal</a> area of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/niagara-falls">Niagara Falls</a>, which was contaminated by the improper disposal of toxic wastes, and on the relocation of some 400 families that had lived there. Remaining problems include continued dumping of sewage and industrial wastes into New York Bay and Long Island Sound, sewage overflows into the Lower Hudson, industrial dumping in the Hudson Valley, nuclear wastes in West Valley in Cattaraugus County, and contamination of fish in Lake Erie. Toxic pollutants, such as organic chemicals and heavy metals, appear in surface and groundwater to an extent not yet fully assessed.</p><p>In 2003, New York had 485 hazardous waste sites listed in the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) database, 86 of which were on the National Priorities List in 2006, including Brookhaven National Laboratory and General Motors Central Foundry Division in Massena. In 2006, New York ranked fourth in the nation for the highest number of sites on the National Priorities List, following New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and California. In 2005, the EPA spent over $32 million through the Superfund program for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites in the state. The same year, federal EPA grants awarded to the state included $64.2 million for the drinking water state revolving fund and over $4.8 million for projects to implement <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/environmental-studies/air-pollution">air pollution</a> controls. Other EPA grants received that year included $2.4 million for projects involved with the Long Island Sound Restoration Act and $330,152 for the Lake Champlain Basin Program.</p><p>A 1982 law requires a deposit on beer and soft-drink containers sold in the state, to encourage return and recycling of bottles and cans.</p><h2>POPULATION</h2><p>New York is no longer the most populous state, having lost that position to California in the 1970 census. However, New York City remains the most populous US city, as it has been since at least 1790. New York state ranked third in population in the United States with an estimated total of 19,254,630 in 2005, an increase of 1.5% since 2000. Between 1990 and 2000, New York's population grew from 17,990,455 to 18,976,457, an increase of 5.5%. The population is projected to reach 19.5 million by 2015. New York's population density in 2004 was 407.2 persons per sq mi, the seventh-highest in the nation. In 2004, the median age for New Yorkers was 37.3, with nearly 23.8% of the populace under age 18 and 13% over 65.</p><p>First in the state as well as the nation in population was New York City, with 8,104,079 residents in 2004 (up from 7,323,000 in 1990). The growth of New York City has been remarkable. In 1790, when the first national census was taken, the city had 49,401 residents. By 1850, its population had boomed to 696,115; by 1900, to 3,437,202, double that of Chicago, the city's closest rival. Manhattan alone housed more people in 1900 than any city outside New York. In 1990, if Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx
had each been a separate city, they would still have ranked third, fourth, sixth, and seventh in the nation, respectively.</p><p>Other leading cities, with their estimated 2004 populations were Buffalo, 282,864; Rochester, 212,481; Yonkers, 197,126; and Syracuse, 143,101. All these cities have lost population since the 1970s. With 18,709,802 people in 2004 (down from 20,196,649 in 1999), the tri-state New York City metropolitan area remained the nation's largest; other major metropolitan areas included those of Buffalo-Niagara Falls, with an estimated 1,154,378 people, and Rochester, with 1,041,499. Albany, the state capital, had an estimated metropolitan population of 845,269 in 2004.</p><h2>ETHNIC GROUPS</h2><p>During the 19th and 20th centuries, New York was the principal gateway for European immigrants. In the great northern migration that began after <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-i">World War I</a>, large numbers of blacks also settled there; more recently there has been an influx of Hispanics and Latinos and, to a lesser extent, of Asians. As of 2000, New York had the largest black and second-largest Asian population among the 50 states, and the second-highest percentage of foreign-born residents.</p><p>According to the US Bureau of the Census, New York had 82,461 Indians in 2000. In 1996, there were an estimated 16,014 Indians living on or adjacent to the reservations of the following seven tribes: the Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora nations, the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, and the Tonawanda Band of</p><table border="1"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" align="left" colspan="8"><b>New York<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>Counties,

In 2004, 6.5% of the state's population was Asian.</p><p>In 2000 there were 3,868,133 foreign-born New Yorkers (20.4% of the total state population), a million more than there had been in 1990 (2,851,861, or 15.8%) and more than any other state except California. Among persons who reported at least one specific ancestry group, 2,122,620 named German; 2,737,146 Italian; 2,454,469 Irish; 1,140,036 English; 986,141 Polish; and 460,261 Russian. These figures do not distinguish the large numbers of European Jewish immigrants who would identify themselves as Jews rather than by their country of origin.</p><p>The ethnic diversity of the state is reflected in such Manhattan neighborhoods as Harlem, Chinatown, Little Italy, and "Spanish," or East, Harlem, with its large Puerto Rican concentration. Many of the more successful ethnics have moved to the suburbs; on the other hand, new immigrants still tend to form ethnic communities, often in the outer boroughs, such as Asians and South Americans in certain parts of Queens and Russian Jews in south Brooklyn. Outside New York City there are also important ethnic enclaves in the Buffalo metropolitan area, with its large populations of Polish and Italian origin.</p><h2>LANGUAGES</h2><p>Just as New York for three centuries has channeled immigrant speakers of other languages into the English-speaking population, so it has helped to channel some of their words into English, with much more rapid dissemination because of the concentration of publishing and communications industries in New York City.</p><p>Little word-borrowing followed contacts by European settlers with the unfriendly Iroquois, who between the 14th and 17th centuries had dispersed the several Algonkian tribes of Montauk, Delaware, and Mahican Indians. In New York State, the effect on English has been almost entirely the adoption of such place-names as Manhattan, Adirondack, Chautauqua, and Skaneateles.</p><p>Although the speech of metropolitan New York has its own characteristics, in the state as a whole the Northern dialect predominates. New York State residents generally say /hahg/ and /fahg/ for <i>hog</i> and <i>fog</i>, /krik/ for <i>creek, greasy</i> with an /s/ sound, and <i>half</i> and <i>path</i> with the vowel of <i>cat</i>. They keep the /r/ after a vowel, as in <i>far</i> and <i>cord;</i> sharply differentiate <i>horse</i> and <i>hoarse</i> by pronouncing the former with the vowel of <i>haw</i> and the latter with the vowel of <i>hoe;</i> and call a clump of hard maples a <i>sugarbush</i>.</p><p>There are many regional variations. In the Hudson Valley, <i>horse</i> and <i>hoarse</i> tend to be pronounced alike, and a sugarbush is called a <i>sap bush</i>. In the eastern sector, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-england">New England</a> <i>piazza</i> for porch and <i>buttonball</i> for sycamore are found, as is the Hudson Valley term <i>nightwalker</i> for a large earthworm. In the Niagara peninsula, Midland <i>eavespout</i> (gutter) and <i>bawl</i> (how a calf sounds) have successfully moved north from Pennsylvania to invade Northern speech. In the North Country, some Canadian influence survives in <i>stook</i> (shock), <i>boodan</i> (liver sausage), and <i>shivaree</i> (wedding celebration). In the New York City area, many speakers pronounce <i>bird</i> almost as if it were /boyd/, do not sound the /h/ in <i>whip</i> or the /r/ after a vowel<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>although the trend now is toward the /r/ pronunciation<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>may pronounce initial /th/ almost like /t/ or /d/, <i>stand on line</i> (instead of in a line) while waiting to buy a huge sandwich they call a <i>hero</i> and may even pronounce <i>Long Island</i> with an inserted /g/ as /long giland/. From the high proportion of New York Yiddish speakers (nearly 40% of all those in the United States in 1990) have come such terms as <i>schlock, schmaltz</i>, and <i>chutzpah</i>.</p><p>Serious communication problems have arisen in New York City, especially in the schools, because of the major influx since <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-ii">World War II</a> of Spanish speakers from the Caribbean region, speakers of so-called <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/language-and-linguistics/black-english">black English</a> from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/south">the South</a>, and, more recently, Asians, in addition to the ever-present large numbers of speakers of other languages. As a result, schools in some areas have emphasized teaching English as a second language.</p><p>According to the 2000 census, 72% of all New Yorkers five years of age or older spoke only English at home, down from 76.7% in 1990.</p><p>The following table gives selected statistics from the 2000 Census for language spoken at home by persons five years old and over.

public life of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-netherland">New Netherland</a> as it did in New England, with its Puritan population. The first Jews were permitted by the Dutch to settle in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> in 1654, but their numbers remained small for the next 200 years. Both the Dutch and later the English forbade the practice of <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/roman-catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>. Full religious freedom was not permitted until the constitution of 1777, and there was no Roman Catholic church in upstate New York until 1797. During the early 19th century, Presbyterian, Methodist, Universalist, Baptist, and Quaker pioneers carried their faith westward across the state. Many Protestant churches took part enthusiastically in the abolitionist movement, and the blacks who fled northward out of slavery formed their own Protestant churches and church organizations.</p><p>For Roman Catholics and Jews, the history of the 19th century is the story of successive waves of immigration: Roman Catholics first from Ireland and Germany, later from Italy and Poland, Jews first from Germany, Austria, and England, later (in vast numbers) from Russia and other Eastern European nations. The Jews who settled in New York City tended to remain there, the Roman Catholic immigrants were more dispersed throughout the state, with a large German and Eastern European group settling in Buffalo. Irish Catholics were the first group to win great political influence, but since <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-ii">World War II</a>, Jews and Italian Catholics have played a leading role, especially in New York City.</p><p>As of 2004, New York had 7,761,801 Roman Catholics, representing about 41% of the total population. About 2,521,087 Roman Catholics were members of the New York Archdiocese. In 2000, there were 1,653,870 adherents of Jewish congregations. Membership of leading Protestant denominations in 2000 included United Methodists, 403,362; Episcopalians, 201,797; Presbyterians (USA), 162,227; and Evangelical Lutherans, 169,329. About 39.6% of the population did not specify a religious affiliation.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/church">The Church</a> of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has reported a fairly strong and steady growth in membership over the past decade. In 1990, membership was reported at 29,997; in 2000 membership grew to 44,987. In 2006, statewide membership was reported at 69,682 in 151 congregations. Three Mormon temples have been established in the state: Harrison (est. 1995), Palmyra (est. 2000), and Manhattan (est. 2004).</p><p>Because of diversified immigration, New York City has small percentages but significant numbers of Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and Orthodox Christians. There were about 223,968 members of Muslim congregations. Though exact membership numbers were not available, there were about 121 Buddhist congregations and 83 Hindu congregations statewide. There is also a wide variety of religious-nationalist sects and cults, including the World Community of Islam in the West, also called the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/islam/islam/nation-islam">Nation of Islam</a> (<a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/islam/islam/black-muslims">Black Muslims</a>), the Hare Krishna group, and the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion-6">Unification Church</a> of the Reverend <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-biographies/sun-myung-moon">Sun Myung Moon</a>.</p><p>The National Council of Churches, founded in 1950 and based in New York City, is one of the leading Christian ecumenical organizations in the country, representing over 45 million people in over 100,000 local congregations. The <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/protestant-denominations/world-council-churches">World Council of Churches</a>, the largest international Christian ecumenical organization, has its US offices in New York City. New York City also serves as the home base for a number of national Jewish organizations, including the American Board of Rabbis-Vaad Harabonim of America, the American Jewish Congress, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the American Sephardi Federation. <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/roman-catholic-orders-and-missions/opus-dei">Opus Dei</a>, a conservative Catholic organization with about 87,000 members worldwide, has its US headquarters in New York City; the organization gained controversial attention in 2006 based on its mention in The Da-Vinci Code, a movie and best-selling novel by Dan Brown.</p><h2>TRANSPORTATION</h2><p>New York City is a major transit point for both domestic and international passenger and freight traffic. The Port of New York and New Jersey is among the nation's busiest harbors; New York City hosts two major airports, Kennedy International and La Guardia, both in Queens. New York City is connected with the rest of the state by an extensive network of good roads, although road and rail transport within the metropolitan region is sagging with age.</p><p>The first railroad in New York State was the Mohawk and Hudson, which made its initial trip from Albany to Schenectady on 9 August 1831. A series of short inter-city rail lines, built during the 1830s and 1840s, were united into the New York Central in 1853. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/cornelius-vanderbilt">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a> gained control of the New York Central in 1867 and by 1873 had connected New York with Chicago. Under Vanderbilt and his son William, rail links were also forged between New York and Boston, Buffalo, Montreal, and western Pennsylvania.</p><p>The height of the railroads' power and commercial importance came during the last decades of the 19th century. After World War I, road vehicles gradually replaced the railroads as freight carriers. In 2003, New York had 4,879 mi (7,855 km) of track. In the same year, there were two Class I lines, in addition to two Canadian lines, four regional, 20 local, and seven switching and terminal railroads operating within the state.</p><p>The decline in freight business, and the railroads' inability to make up the loss of passenger traffic, led to a series of reorganizations and failures, of which the best known is the merger of the New York Central with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the subsequent bankruptcy of the Penn Central. Today, much of New York's rail network is operated by either CSX or the Norfolk Southern. The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) owns and operates lines along the eastern corridor from Boston through New York City to Washington, DC. Regularly scheduled daily trains are operated through New York State, stopping at 25 stations. New York City's Penn Station is the busiest station in the entire Amtrak system. The Long Island Railroad, an important commuter carrier, is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which also operates the New York City subways. Construction of the New York City subway system began in 1900, with service starting on 27 October 1904. The route network is about 230 mi (370 km) long, of which 137 mi (220 km) are underground.</p><p>The only other mass-transit rail line in the state is Buffalo's 6.4 mi (10.3 km) light rail system, of which 5.2 mi (8.4 km) is underground. In 1984, regular trolley service resumed in Buffalo for the first time since 1950 on the other 1.2 mi (1.9 km) of track, running through the downtown shopping district. Among cities served by municipal, county, or metropolitan-area bus systems are Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Elmira, and Syracuse.</p><p>In 2004, there were some 11.048 million motor vehicles registered in New York State, including around 8.468 million automobiles, some 25,000 buses, and about 2.386 million trucks of all types. In addition, around 169,000 motorcycles were also registered as of that same year. The state in 2004, had 113,341 mi (182,479 km) of public roads and highways. The major toll road, and the nation's longest toll superhighway, is the Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, operated by the New York State Thruway Authority, which extends 559 mi (900 km) from just outside New York City to Buffalo and the Pennsylvania border in southwestern New York. Toll-free expressways include the Adirondack Northway (I-87), from Albany to the Canadian border, and the North-South Expressway (I-81), from the Canadian to the Pennsylvania border.</p><p>A number of famous bridges and tunnels connect the five boroughs of New York City with each other and with New Jersey. The <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/verrazano-narrows-bridge">Verrazano-Narrows Bridge</a>, opened to traffic in 1964, spans New York Harbor between Brooklyn and Staten Island. Equally famous, and especially renowned for their beauty, are the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/brooklyn-bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a> (1883), the city's first suspension bridge, and the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/george-washington">George Washington</a> Bridge (1931). The Holland (1927) and Lincoln (1937<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>57) tunnels under the Hudson River link Manhattan with New Jersey. Important links among the five boroughs include the Triborough Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, Queensboro Bridge, Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, and Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The Staten Island Ferry conveys passengers and autos between the borough and lower Manhattan.</p><p>Until the early 1800s, almost all the state's trade moved on the Atlantic Ocean, Hudson River, and New York Bay. This waterway transportation system was expanded starting in the 1820s. Off the Hudson, one of the country's major arteries, branched the main elements of the New York Barge Canal System: the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/erie-canal">Erie Canal</a>, linking the Atlantic with Lake Erie, and New York City with Buffalo; the Oswego Canal, connecting the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/erie-canal">Erie Canal</a> with Lake Ontario; the Cayuga and Seneca Canal, connecting the Erie Canal with Cayuga and Seneca lakes; and the Champlain Canal, extending the state's navigable waterways from the Hudson to Lake Champlain, and so to Vermont and Quebec Province. By 1872, New York's canal system was carrying over 6 million tons of cargo per year; however, an absolute decline in freight tonnage began after 1890 (the relative decline had begun 40 years earlier, with the rise of the railroads). By the mid-1980s, the canals carried less than 10% of the tonnage for 1880.</p><p>Buffalo, on Lake Erie, is the most important inland port. In 2004, it handled 1.592 million tons of cargo. Albany, the major port on the Hudson, handled 7.450 million tons of cargo, and Port Jefferson, on Long Island Sound, handled 2.398 million tons in 2004. In that same year, New York had 394 mi (634 km) of navigable inland waterways. Waterborne shipments in 2003 totaled 99.406 million tons.</p><p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the historic and economic importance of New York Harbor<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>haven for explorers, point of entry for millions of refugees and immigrants, and the nation's greatest seaport until recent years, when it was surpassed by Greater <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> and Houston in terms of cargo tonnage. Harbor facilities, including those of Bayonne, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/jersey-city">Jersey City</a>, and Newark, New Jersey, add up to 755 mi (1,215 km) of frontage, with some 700 piers and wharves. The entire port is under the jurisdiction of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/port-authority-new-york-and">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. In 2004, it handled 152.377 million tons of cargo. In the mid-1990s, the port was served by 1,000 trucking companies, 80 steamship lines, and 12 intermodal rail terminals.</p><p>In 2005, the state of New York had a total of 582 public and private-use aviation-related facilities. This included 397 airports, 167 heliports, and 18 seaplane bases. By far the busiest airports in the state are <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-f-kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> International (18,586,863 passengers enplaned in 2004) and La Guardia (12,312,561 passengers enplaned in 2004), both in New York City, and making them the 8th- and 20th-busiest airports in the United States, respectively. Buffalo Niagara International Airport was the state's largest airport outside of New York City, with 2,206,385 passengers enplaned in 2004.</p><h2>HISTORY</h2><p>The region now known as New York State has been inhabited for about 10,000 years. The first Indians probably came across the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/arctic-physical-geography/bering-strait">Bering Strait</a> and most likely reached New York via the Niagara Peninsula. Remains have been found in southwestern New York of the Indians called <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/anthropology-and-archaeology/archaeology-general/mound-builders">Mound Builders</a> (for their practice of burying their dead in large mounds), who cultivated food crops and tobacco. The <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/anthropology-and-archaeology/archaeology-general/mound-builders">Mound Builders</a> were still living in the state well after ad 1000, although by that time most of New York was controlled by later migrants of the Algonkian linguistic group. These Algonkian tribes included the Mahican in the northeast, the Wappinger in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island, and the Leni-Lenape (or Delaware) of the Delaware Valley.</p><p>Indians of the Iroquoian language group invaded the state from the north and west during the early 14th century. In 1570, after European explorers had discovered New York but before the establishment of any permanent European settlements, the main Iroquois tribes<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, Cayuga, and Mohawk<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>established the League of the Five Nations. For the next 200 years, members of the League generally kept peace among themselves but made war on other tribes, using not only traditional weapons but also the guns they were able to get from the French, Dutch, and English. In 1715, a sixth nation joined the League<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the Tuscarora, who had fled the British in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/north-carolina">North Carolina</a>. For much of the 18th century, the Iroquois played a skillful role in balancing competing French and British interests.</p><p>The first European known to have entered New York Harbor was the Florentine navigator <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/giovanni-da-verrazano">Giovanni da Verrazano</a>, on 17 April 1524. The Frenchman <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/canadian-history-biographies/samuel-de-champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a> began exploring the St. Lawrence River in 1603. While Champlain was aiding the Huron Indians in their fight against the League in 1609, the English mariner <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/henry-hudson">Henry Hudson</a>, in the service of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/benelux-history/dutch-east-india-company">Dutch East India Company</a>, entered New York Bay and sailed up the river that would later bear his name, reaching about as far as Albany. To the Dutch the area did not look especially promising, and there was no permanent Dutch settlement until 1624, three years after the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/benelux-history/dutch-west-india-company">Dutch West India Company</a> had been founded. The area near Albany was first to be settled. The Dutch were mainly interested in fur trading and agriculture in the colony<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>named <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-netherland">New Netherland</a><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>was slow to develop. <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> was founded in 1626, when Director-General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/peter-minuit">Peter Minuit</a> bought Manhattan (from the Indian word manahatin, "hill island") from the Indians for goods worth<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>as tradition has it<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>about $24.</p><p>New Amsterdam grew slowly, and by 1650 had no more than 1,000 people. When the British took over New Netherland in 1664, only 8,000 residents lived in the colony. Already, however, the population was remarkably diverse: there were the Dutch and English, of course, but also French, Germans, Finns, Swedes, and Jews, as well as black slaves from Angola. The Swedes lived in what had been <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-sweden">New Sweden</a>, a territory along the Delaware River ceded to the Netherlands during the administration of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/peter-stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>. Equally famed for his wooden leg and his hot temper, Stuyvesant had become director general of the New Netherland colony in 1647. Three years later, after skirmishes with the English settlers of New England, the colony gave up all claims to the Connecticut Valley in the Treaty of Hartford.</p><p>Though small and weak, New Netherland was an annoyance to the English. The presence of Dutch traders in New York Bay made it difficult for England to enforce its monopolies under the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/navigation-acts">Navigation Acts</a>. Moreover, the Dutch colony was a political barrier between New England and two other English colonies, Maryland and Virginia. So, in 1664, King Charles II awarded "all the land from the west side of the Connecticutte River to the East Side of De La Ware Bay" to his brother, the Duke of York and Albany, the future King James II. The British fleet arrived in New York Bay on 18 August 1664. Stuyvesant wanted to fight, but his subjects refused, and the governor had no choice but to surrender. The English agreed to preserve the Dutch rights of property and inheritance, and to guarantee complete liberty of conscience. Thus New Netherland became New York. It remained an English colony for the next 112 years, except for a period in 1673 when Dutch rule was briefly restored.</p><p>The first decades under the English were stormy. After repeated demands from the colonists, a General Assembly was called in 1683. The assembly adopted a Charter of Liberties and Privileges, but the document, approved by James before his coronation, was revoked after he became king in 1685. The assembly itself was dissolved in 1686, and James II acted to place New York under the dominion of New England. The plan was aborted by the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/glorious-revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, when James was forced to abdicate. Power in New York fell to <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/jacob-leisler">Jacob Leisler</a>, a German merchant with local backing. Leisler ruled until 1691, when a new royal governor arrived and had Leisler hanged for treason.</p><p>The succeeding decades were marked by conflict between the English and French and by the rising power of the provincial assembly in relations with the British crown. As early as 1690, a band of 150 Frenchmen and 100 Indians attacked and burned Schenectady. New York contributed men and money to campaign against the French in Canada in 1709 and 1711 (during Queen Anne's War) and in 1746 (during King George's War). In 1756, the English determined to drive the French out of the region once and for all. After some early reverses, the English defeated the French in 1760. The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/treaty-paris">Treaty of Paris</a> (1763), ending the French and Indian War, ceded all territory east of the Mississippi to England, except for <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> and two islands in the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. The Iroquois, their power weakened during the course of the war, signed treaties giving large areas of their land to the New York colony.</p><p>The signing of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/treaty-paris">Treaty of Paris</a> was followed by English attempts to tighten control over the colonies, in New York as elsewhere. New York merchants vehemently protested the Sugar Act and <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/stamp-act">Stamp Act</a>, and the radical <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/sons-liberty">Sons of Liberty</a> made their first appearance in the colony in October 1765. Later, in 1774, after <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/paul-revere">Paul Revere</a> brought news of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/boston-tea-party">Boston Tea Party</a> to New York City, British tea was also dumped into that city's harbor. Nevertheless, New York hesitated before committing itself to independence. The colony's delegates to the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/continental-congress">Continental Congress</a> in Philadelphia were not permitted by the Third Provincial Congress in New York to vote either for or against the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/declaration-independence">Declaration of Independence</a> on 4 July 1776. The Fourth Provincial Congress, meeting at White Plains, did ratify the Declaration five days later. On 6 February 1778, New York became the second state to ratify the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/articles-confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>.</p><p>Nearly one-third of all battles during the Revolutionary War took place on New York soil. The action there began when troops under <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/ethan-allen">Ethan Allen</a> captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775, and Seth Warner and his New England forces took Crown Point. Reverses came in 1776, however, when <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/george-washington">George Washington</a>'s forces were driven from Long Island and Manhattan by the British; New York City was to remain in British hands for the rest of the war. Troops commanded by British General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/british-and-irish-history-biographies/john-burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> recaptured Ticonderoga in July 1777, but were defeated in October at Saratoga, in a battle that is often considered the turning point of the war. In 1778, General Washington made his headquarters at <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/west-point">West Point</a>, which General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/benedict-arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> tried unsuccessfully to betray to the British in 1780. Washington moved his forces to New-burgh in 1782, and marched into New York City on 25 November 1785, the day the British evacuated their forces. On 4 December, he said farewell to his officers at Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan, a landmark that still stands.</p><p>Even as war raged, New York State adopted its first constitution on 20 April 1777. The constitution provided for an elected governor and house of assembly, but the franchise was limited to property holders. The first state capital was Kingston, but the capital was moved to Albany in January 1797. After much debate, in which the Federalist <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/alexander-hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> played a leading role, the state ratified the US Constitution (with amendments) on 26 July 1788. New York City served as the seat of the US government from 11 January 1785 to 12 August 1790, and the first US president, George Washington, was inaugurated in the city on 30 April 1789.</p><p>George Clinton was the state's first elected governor, serving from 1777 to 1795 and again from 1801 to 1804. The achievements under his governorship were considerable. Commerce and agriculture expanded, partly because of Clinton's protectionist policies and partly because of the state's extremely favorable geographical situation.</p><p>The end of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/war-1812">War of 1812</a> signaled the opening of an era of unprecedented economic expansion for the state. By this time, the Iroquois were no longer a threat (most had sided with the British during the Revolutionary War, and many later fled to Canada). Migrants from New England were flocking to the state, which the census of 1810 showed was the most populous in the country. Small wonder that New York was the site of the early 19th century's most ambitious engineering project: construction of the Erie Canal. Ground was broken for the canal in 1817, during the first term of Governor <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/de-witt-clinton">De Witt Clinton</a>, the nephew of George Clinton; the first vessels passed through the completed canal in 1825.</p><p>Actually, New York had emerged as the nation's leading commercial center before the canal was even started. The textile industry had established itself by the mid-1820s, and the dairy industry was thriving. The effects of the canal were felt most strongly in foreign trade<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>by 1831, 50% of US imports and 27% of US exports passed through the state<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>and in the canal towns of Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo, where business boomed.</p><p>Commercial progress during this period was matched by social and cultural advancement. New York City became a center of literary activity during the 1820s, and by the 1840s was already the nation's theatrical capital. A new state constitution drafted in 1821 established universal white male suffrage, but retained the property qualifications for blacks. Slavery was abolished as of 4 July 1827 (few slaves actually remained in the state by this time), and New Yorkers soon took the lead in the growing antislavery movement. The first women's rights convention in the United States was held in Seneca Falls in 1848<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>though women would have to wait until 1917 before winning the right to vote in state elections. Also during the 1840s, the state saw the first of several great waves of European immigration. The Irish and Germans were the earliest major arrivals during the 19th century, but before World War I they would be joined<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>not always amicably<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>by Italians and European Jews.</p><p>New Yorkers voted for <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/abraham-lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> in the presidential election of 1860 and were among the readiest recruits to the Union side. Enthusiasm for the conflict diminished during the next two years, however. When the military draft reached New York City on 11 July 1863, the result was three days of rioting in which blacks were lynched and the homes of prominent abolitionists were burned. But New York was not a wartime battleground, and overall the war and Reconstruction were very good for business.</p><p>The decades after the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a> ushered in an era of extraordinary commercial growth and political corruption. This was the Gilded Age, during which entrepreneurs became multimillionaires and New York was transformed from an agricultural state to an industrial giant. In 1860, the leading manufactures in the state were flour and meal, men's clothing, refined sugar, leather goods, liquor, and lumber; 90 years later, apparel, printing and publishing, food, machinery, chemicals, fabricated metal products, electrical machinery, textiles, instruments, and transportation equipment had became the dominant industries.</p><p>The key to this transformation was the development of the railroads. The boom period for railroad construction started in the 1850s and reached its high point after 1867, when "Commodore" <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/cornelius-vanderbilt">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a>, who had been a steamboat captain in 1818, took over the New York Central. During the 1860s, native New Yorkers like <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/jay-gould">Jay Gould</a> and Russell Sage made their fortunes through investment and speculation. Especially during the century's last two decades, corporate names that became household words began to emerge: Westinghouse Electric in 1886, General Electric (as Edison Electric) in 1889, Eastman Kodak in 1892. In 1882, another native New Yorker, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/john-d-rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>, formed the Standard Oil Trust; although the trust would eventually be broken up, the Rockefeller family would help shape New York politics for many decades to come.</p><p>The period immediately following the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a> also marked a new high in political influence for the Tammany Society (or "Tammany Hall"), founded in 1789 as an anti-Federalist organization. From 1857 until his exposure by the press in 1871, Democrat William March "Boss" Tweed ruled Tammany and effectively dominated New York City by dispersing patronage, buying votes, and bribing legislators and judges. Tammany went into temporary eclipse after the Tweed Ring was broken up, and Republicans swept the state in 1872. The first result was a series of constitutional changes, including one abolishing the requirement that blacks hold property in order to vote. A new constitution approved in 1894, and effective in 1895, remains the basic law of New York State today.</p><p>During the Union's first 100 years, New York's political life had projected into national prominence such men as <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/alexander-hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-jay">John Jay</a>, George and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/de-witt-clinton">De Witt Clinton</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/martin-van-buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/millard-fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>. The state's vast population<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>New York held more electoral votes than any other state between 1812 and 1972<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>coupled with its growing industrial and financial power, enhanced the prestige of state leaders during the nation's second century. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/grover-cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, though born in New Jersey, became mayor of Buffalo, then governor of New York, and finally the 22d US president in 1885. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/theodore-roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was governor of New York, then became vice president and finally president of the United States in 1901. In 1910, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/supreme-court-biographies/charles-evans-hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a> resigned the governorship to become an associate justice of the US Supreme Court; he also served as secretary of state, and in 1930 was appointed chief justice of the United States. By the 1920s, Tammany had rebounded from the Tweed Ring breakup and from another scandal during the 1890s to reach its peak of prestige: Alfred E. Smith, a longtime member of Tammany, as well as an able and popular official, was four times elected governor and in 1928 became the first Roman Catholic candidate to be nominated by a major party for the presidency of the United States. That year saw the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt as governor of New York.</p><p>The 1930s, a period of depression, ushered in a new wave of progressive government. From 1933 until 1945, FDR was in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/white-house">White House</a>. Roosevelt's successor in the statehouse was Herbert H. Lehman, whose Little <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/new-deal">New Deal</a> established the basic pattern of present state <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/social-1">social welfare</a> policies that had begun on a much more modest scale during Smith's administration. The Fusion mayor of New York City at this time<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>propelled into office by yet another wave of exposure of Tammany corruption<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>was the colorful and popular <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/fiorello-h-la-guardia">Fiorello H. La Guardia</a>.</p><p>The decades following World War II saw extraordinary expansion of New York social services, including construction of the state university system, but also an erosion of the state's industrial base. Fiscal crises were not new to the state<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>reformers in the 1920s railed against New York City's "spendthrift" policies<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>but the greatly increased scale of government in the 1970s made the fiscal crisis of 1975 unprecedented in its scope and implications. The city's short-term debt grew from virtually zero to about $6 billion between 1970 and 1975, although its government reported consistently balanced budgets. Eventually a package totaling $4.5 billion in aid was needed to avoid bankruptcy. The decreasing pace of population and industrial growth during the 1950s and 1960s, and the decline during the 1970s, also led to a dimming of New York's political fortunes. The single dominant political figure in New York after World War II, Nelson A. Rockefeller (governor, 1958<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>73), tried and failed three times to win the Republican presidential nomination before his appointment to the vice-presidency
in 1974. Unable to overcome the hostility of his party's conservative wing, he was not renominated for the vice-presidency in 1976. In 1984, however, US Representative Geraldine Ferraro of Queens was the Democratic Party's vice-presidential standard-bearer, and Governor <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/mario-m-cuomo">Mario M. Cuomo</a> emerged as an influential Democratic spokesman. After serving for 12 years, Cuomo was replaced in 1995 by State Senator George Pataki, the first Republican elected New York governor since 1970.</p><p>From the late 1970s through the late 1980s, New York enjoyed an economic boom, particularly in finance, insurance, real estate and construction. The state budget increased in constant dollars by 20%. While much of that increase compensated for cuts in federal aid to states and was directed at education, municipalities, schools and prisons, some went to meet new needs such as homelessness and AIDS victims. Prosperity did not reach all sectors of the economy or the population, however. In 1984, 25% of the residents of New York City lived below the poverty line. The collapse of the stock market in October of 1987, in which the market plunged 36% in two months, not only forced a retrenchment on <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a> but also signaled the end of the boom and the beginning of a recession that was quite severe in New York, exacerbated by the curtailment of federal funding by the Reagan and Bush administrations. Unemployment peaked in 1992, and by 1994 a recovery was under way.</p><p>The boom economy of the late 1990s boosted <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a>, with the bulls dominating the stock market despite some historic losses, particularly in the technology sector, which analysts later categorized as "market corrections." In 1998 New York had the fourth-highest per capita income in the nation ($31,679) but it also had more people living below the poverty level than 45 other states, again indicating prosperity had not reached into all sectors.</p><p>The 1990s witnessed the settlement of the lawsuits surrounding <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/love-canal">Love Canal</a> in Buffalo, where leaking chemical wastes in the 1970s and early 1980s had prompted the state and federal governments to pay to move families from the area. In the largest legal settlement in New York's history, in 1994 <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/occidental">Occidental Petroleum Corp</a>. agreed to pay $98 million in damages for the dumping of hazardous wastes at Love Canal, ending 16 years of litigation.</p><p>The state, which dropped from the nation's second to third most populous in 1994, retained the ranking in 2005. According to Census Bureau estimates, the state had over 19 million people in 2005<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>surpassed only by California and Texas. New York's Hispanic population in 2003 was estimated to be roughly the same in number as its African American population (<a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/african-americans">African Americans</a> 15.9%; Hispanics 15.1%).</p><p>In mid-1999, in the midst of a budget impasse in the state legislature, the government determined it would sell state facilities. A resulting deal, reached in 2000, saw the state selling two nuclear plants for a total asking price of $967 million. It was the largest privatization of state assets in New York history.</p><p>Transportation in and around New York City was the focus of the statehouse and legislature in 2000. Governor George Pataki and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, a fellow Republican, had squared off over issues surrounding the Port Authority, which the states jointly control. The governors resolved their differences in June 2000. They cleared the way for the construction of a $200-million cargo hub for the world's largest ocean carrier (Maersk Sealand) and reopened the possibility that the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a>, which the Port Authority still controlled, could be turned over to a private developer. Meanwhile, lawmakers heard arguments for and against a proposed $17-billion project to be undertaken by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). Advocates argued the public works plan, which would result in the largest sale of municipal bonds in US history, was necessary to build a new generation of subways, buses, and trains to serve the greater New York area. Opponents believed the project would pose disaster for the MTA, burying the agency under a mountain of debt and rendering it unable to maintain the existing transportation systems.</p><p>New York City was one site of the nation's terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, when hijackers from the al-Qaeda terrorist organization flew two passenger airliners into the North and South Towers of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a>, destroying them. Another aircraft hit <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/pentagon">the Pentagon</a> building in Washington, DC, and a fourth crashed into a field in Stony Creek Township, Pennsylvania. Approximately 3,000 people had died, were missing, or presumed dead as a result of the attacks. The city and the nation went into a long period of mourning. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was praised for his effective handling of the crisis.</p><p>Berlin-based architect <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/daniel-libeskind">Daniel Libeskind</a>'s design for rebuilding "Ground Zero" (the site of the demolished World Trade Center) was accepted in 2003; New Yorkers had expressed dissatisfaction with the original designs, which were thought to be uninspiring. Libeskind's design features a complex of angular towers and a spire that would be among the world's tallest structures.</p><p>New York was one of the states affected by the 14 August 2003 massive power blackout in Canada, the Northeast and Midwestern states. The largest electrical outage in US history affected 9,300 square miles and a population of over 50 million.</p><p>Following the decline of the stock market on Wall Street and the US recession in the early 2000s, New York in 2003 was plagued with economic woes. The state faced a budget deficit of $10 billion that year. Although the economy began to improve in 2004 and 2005, the state still faced a budget gap of $4.2 billion in 2005<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>06. In 2004, New York had the fifth-highest per capita personal income in the nation, at $38,228, behind Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. The poverty rate for New York in 2003<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>04 was 14.6%, above the national rate of 12.6% (measured as a two-year average).</p><h2>STATE GOVERNMENT</h2><p>New York has had four constitutions, adopted in 1777, 1822, 1846, and 1895. The 1895 constitution was extensively revised in 1938, and the basic structure of state government has not changed since then, although the document had been amended 216 times by January 2005. In 1993 the Temporary State Commission on Constitutional Revision was created in anticipation of a referendum on a constitutional convention in 1997.</p><p>The legislature consists of a 62-member Senate and 150-member assembly. Senators and assembly members serve two-year terms and are elected in even-numbered years. Each house holds regular annual sessions, which begin in January and are not formally limited in length; special sessions may be called by the governor or initiated by petition of two-thirds of the membership of each body. All legislators must be at least 18 years old, US citizens, and must have been residents of the state for at least five years and
residents of their districts for at least one year prior to election. The legislative salary was $79,500 in 2004, unchanged from 1999.</p><p>Either senators or assembly members may introduce or amend a bill; the governor may introduce a budget bill. To pass, a bill requires a majority vote in both houses; a two-thirds majority (of the elected members in each house) is required to override the governor's veto. If the governor neither signs nor vetoes a bill, it becomes law after 10 days, as long as the legislature is in session.</p><p>The state's only elected executives are the governor, lieutenant governor, comptroller, and attorney general. Each serves a four-year term. The governor and lieutenant governor are jointly elected; there is no limit to the number of terms they may serve. The governor must be at least 25 years old, a US citizen, and a resident of the state for at least one year prior to the date of election. The lieutenant governor is next in line for the governorship (should the governor be unable to complete his term in office) and presides over the Senate. As of December 2004, the governor's salary was $179,000, unchanged from 1999.</p><p>The governor appoints the heads of most of the major executive departments, with some of the appointments requiring the advice and consent of the Senate. The exceptions are the comptroller and attorney general, who are elected by the voters; the commissioner of education, who is named by the Regents of the University of the State of New York; the commissioner of social services, elected by the Board of Social Services; and the chief of the Executive Department, which the governor heads ex officio.</p><p>A bill becomes law when passed by both houses of the legislature and signed by the governor.

Amendments so approved are put on the ballot in November and adopted or rejected by majority vote. The constitution also provides that the voters must be permitted every 20 years to decide whether a convention should be called to amend the present constitution. Voters in New York must be US citizens, at least 18 years old, residents of the county (or New York City) for 30 days prior to election day, and unable to claim the right to vote elsewhere. Restrictions apply to convicted felons and those declared mentally incompetent by the court.</p><h2>POLITICAL PARTIES</h2><p>In addition to the Democratic and Republican parties, the major political groups, there has always been a profusion of minor parties in New York, some of which have significantly influenced the outcomes of national and state elections.</p><p>Party politics in the state crystallized into their present form around 1855. Up to that time, a welter of parties and factions<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>including such short-lived groups as the Anti-Masons, Bucktails, Clintonians, Hunkers, and Barnburners (split into Hardshell and Softshell Democrats), Know-Nothings (Native <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/american-party">American Party</a>),
Wooly Heads and Silver-Grays (factions of the Whigs), and the Liberty Party<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>jockeyed for power in New York State.</p><p>Roughly speaking, the Democratic Party evolved out of the Democratic Republican factions of the old Republican Party and had become a unified party by the 1850s. The Democratic power base was<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>and has remained<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the big cities, especially New York City. The most important big-city political machine from the 1860s through the 1950s, except for a few brief periods, was the Tammany Society ("Tammany Hall"). Tammany controlled the Democratic Party in New York City and, through that party, the city itself.</p><p>The Republican Party in New York State emerged in 1855 as the heir of the Whigs, the Liberty Party, and the Softshell Democratic faction. The Republican Party's power base includes the state's rural counties, the smaller cities and towns, and (though not so much in the 1970s and early 1980s as in earlier decades) the New York City suburbs. Although New York Republicans stand to the right of the Democrats on social issues, they have usually been well to the left of the national Republican Party. The liberal "internationalist" strain of Republicanism was personified during the 1960s by Governor Nelson Rockefeller, US Senator Jacob Javits, and New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay (who later became a Democrat).</p><p>The disaffection of more conservative Republicans and Democrats within the state led to the formation of the Conservative Party in 1963. At first intended as a device to exert pressure on the state Republican establishment, the Conservative Party soon became a power in its own right, electing a US senator, James Buckley, in 1970. Its power decreased in the late 1970s as the Republican Party embraced some of its positions. The Conservative Party has its left-wing counterpart in the Liberal Party, which was formed in 1944 by dissidents in the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/american-labor-party">American Labor Party</a> who claimed the ALP was Communist-influenced. Tied strongly to labor interests, the Liberals have normally supported the national Democratic ticket. Their power, however, has waned considerably in recent years.</p><p>Minor parties have sometimes meant the difference between victory and defeat for major party candidates in state and national elections. The Liberal Party line provided the victory margin in the state, and therefore the nation, for Democratic presidential candidate <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-f-kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> in 1960. Other significant, though not victorious, minor-party presidential candidates have included the American Labor Party with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/henry-wallace">Henry Wallace</a> in 1948 (8% of the vote), the Courage Party with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/george-wallace">George Wallace</a> in 1968 (5%), and the Liberal Party with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/philosophy-biographies/john-anderson">John Anderson</a> in 1980 (7%). Among radical parties, the Socialists qualified for the presidential ballot continuously between 1900 and 1952, reaching a peak of 203,201 votes (7% of the total) in 1920.</p><p>Democrat <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/mario-m-cuomo">Mario M. Cuomo</a> was defeated in his run for a fourth term as governor in November 1994 by Republican George Pataki; Pataki was elected to a third term in 2002. In 2003 New York's US senators were Democrat Charles Schumer, elected to his first term in 1998 to succeed three-term Republican Alphonse D'Amato was reelected in 2004, and Democrat <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/hillary-rodham-clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>, first elected in 2000. Following the 2004 elections, New York's US representatives included 20 Democrats and 9 Republicans. Republicans held 35 seats in the state Senate while Democrats held 27. In the State Assembly there were 105 Democrats and 45 Republicans.</p><p>In the November 1980 presidential elections, Republican nominee Ronald Reagan (with Conservative Party backing) won the state's then-41 electoral votes, apparently because John Anderson, running in New York State on the Liberal Party line, siphoned enough votes from the Democratic incumbent, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/jimmy-carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, to give Reagan a plurality. Reagan carried the state again in 1984, despite the presence on the Democratic ticket of US Representative Geraldine Ferraro of Queens as the running mate of Walter Mondale; Ferraro was the first woman candidate for president or vice president on a major party ticket. New Yorkers chose Democratic nominees Michael Dukakis and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/bill-clinton">Bill Clinton</a> in 1988 and 1992, respectively, and Clinton again won the state in 1996. In the 2000 presidential election, Democrat Al Gore won 60% of the vote to Republican George W. Bush's 35%; Green Party candidate <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/social-reformers/ralph-nader">Ralph Nader</a> garnered 4% of the vote. In 2004, Democratic challenger John Kerry won 57.8% to incumbent George W. Bush's 40.5%. In 2004 there were 11,837,000 registered voters. In 1998, 47% of registered voters were Democratic, 29% Republican, and 24% unaffiliated or members of other parties. The state had 31 electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election, a loss of 2 votes over the 2000 election.</p><p>In November 1993, New York City mayor David Dinkins, a Democrat and New York's first black mayor, who had served since 1990, was defeated by Republican Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani was legally barred from seeking a third term, and billionaire media tycoon <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> won the mayoral contest in 2001; Bloomberg was reelected in 2005.</p><h2>LOCAL GOVERNMENT</h2><p>The state constitution, endorsing the principle of home rule, recognizes many different levels of <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts/local">local government</a>. In 2005, New York had 62 counties, 616 municipal governments, 703 <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/public-school">public school</a> districts, and 1,135 special districts. In 2002, there were 929 townships.</p><p>Cities are contained within counties, with one outstanding exception: New York City is made up of five counties, one for each of its five boroughs. Traditionally, counties are run by an elected board of supervisors or county legislature; however, a growing number of counties have vested increased powers in a single elected county executive. With the exception of some counties within New York City, each county has a county attorney and district attorney, sheriff, fiscal officer (treasurer), county clerk, and commissioner of social services.</p><p>Towns are run by a town board; the town supervisor is the board's presiding officer and acts as town treasurer. A group of people within a town or towns may also incorporate themselves into a village, with their own elected mayor and elected board of trustees. Some villages have administrators or managers. Members of the village remain members of the town, and must pay taxes to both jurisdictions. The constitution grants the state legislature the power to decide which taxes the local governments may levy and how much debt they may incur.</p><p>New York City is governed by a mayor and city council, but much practical power resides in the Board of Estimate. On this board sit the city's three top elected officials<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the mayor, comptroller, and city council president. The board also includes the five borough presidents, elected officials who represent (and, to a limited extent, govern) each of the five boroughs. New York City gov-ernment is further complicated by the fact that certain essential services are provided not by the city itself but by independent "authorities." The special district of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/port-authority-new-york-and">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>, for example, operates New York Harbor, sets interstate bridge and tunnel tolls, and supervises the city's bus and air terminals; it is responsible not to the mayor but to the governors of New York and New Jersey. Similarly, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the city's subways and some of its commuter rail lines, is an independent agency responsible to the state rather than the city.</p><p>In 2005, <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts/local">local government</a> accounted for about 938,753 full-time (or equivalent) employment positions.</p><h2>STATE SERVICES</h2><p>To address the continuing threat of terrorism and to work with the federal Department of Homeland Security, homeland security in New York operates under state statute; the homeland security director is designated as the state homeland security advisor.</p><p>Educational services are provided through the Education Department. Under this department's jurisdiction are the State Library, the State Museum, the State Archives, the New York State School for the Blind at Batavia, and the New York State School for the Deaf at Rome. The Education Department also issues licenses for 38 professions, including architecture, engineering and land surveying, massage, pharmacy, public accountancy, <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/social-2">social work</a>, and various medical specialties. The state university system is administered by a separate agency headed by a chancellor.</p><p>Transportation services are under the direction of the Department of Transportation, which has responsibility for highways, aviation, mass transit, railroads, water transport, transportation safety, and intrastate rate regulation. The Department of Motor Vehicles licenses all road vehicles, motor vehicle dealers, motor vehicle operators, and driving schools.</p><p>Human services are provided through several state departments. Among the programs and facilities operated by the Department of Health are three research and treatment facilities; the New York State Veterans' Home at Oxford, Roswell Park Memorial Institute at Buffalo, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/theater-biographies/helen-hayes">Helen Hayes</a> Hospital at West Haverstraw. The state provides care for the mentally ill, retarded, and alcoholics and other substance-dependent persons through the Office of Mental Health, the Office of Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities, and the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services. The Office of Mental Health maintains psychiatric centers and developmental centers for developmental disabilities. The Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance within the Department of Family Assistance supervises and sets standards for locally administered public and private welfare and health programs, including Food Stamps and TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families). The Office of Children and Family Services, also within the Department of Family Assistance, has special responsibilities for the blind and visually handicapped and over Indian affairs. Other human services are provided through the Division of Veterans' Affairs, the Division of Human Rights, and the Office for the Aging, all within the Executive Department.</p><p>Public protection services include state armed forces, corrections, and consumer protection. Included within the Division of Military and Naval Affairs, in the Executive Department, are the Army <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/national-guard">National Guard</a>, Air <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/national-guard">National Guard</a>, Naval Militia, and New York Guard. The Division of State Police operates within the Executive Department, while prisons are administered by the separate Department of Correctional Services. <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/military-affairs-nonnaval/state">The State</a> Consumer Protection Board (Executive Department) coordinates the consumer protection activities of the various agencies and departments. The major legal role in consumer protection is played by the attorney general.</p><p>Housing services are provided through the Division of Housing and Community Renewal of the Executive Department, and through the quasi-independent New York State Housing Finance Agency/State of New York Mortgage Agency. The Department of State serves as a keeper of records and licensing agency, as well as serving the financial, corporate, and legal community. The Governor's office has a Women's Advisory.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/natural-resources">Natural resources</a> protection services are centralized in the Department of Environmental Conservation. The administration of the state park and recreation system is carried out by the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, in the Executive Department. The Department of Agriculture and Markets serves the interests of farmers and also administers the state's Pure Food Law. Energy is the province of the Department of Public Service. The quasi-independent Power Authority of the State of New York finances, builds, and operates electricity-generating and transmission facilities.</p><p>The Department of Labor provides most labor services for the state. Its responsibilities include occupational health and safety, human resource development and allocation, administration of unemployment insurance and other benefit programs, and maintenance of labor standards, including enforcement of <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/labor/minimum-wage">minimum wage</a> and other labor laws. The Employment Relations Board tries to settle labor disputes and prevent work stoppages.</p><h2>JUDICIAL SYSTEM</h2><p>New York's highest court is the Court of Appeals in Albany, with appellate jurisdiction only. The Court of Appeals consists of a chief judge and six associate judges, appointed by the governor and approved by the Senate for 14-year terms. Below the Court of Appeals is the state's Supreme Court, with nearly 570 justices in 12 judicial districts. The Supreme Court of New York State does not sit as one body, instead most supreme court justices are assigned original jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, while 56 justices are assigned to the appellate division of supreme court and 15 to appellate terms of supreme court. Supreme Court justices are elected by district and serve 14-year terms.</p><p>The New York Court of Claims sits in Albany, with judges appointed by the governor to nine-year terms, along with judges sitting as acting Supreme Court justices in felony trials. This special trial court hears civil cases involving claims by or against the state.</p><p>Outside New York City, each county has its own county court to handle criminal cases, although some are delegated to be handled by lower courts. County court judges are elected to 10-year terms. Many counties have a surrogate's court to handle such matters as wills and estates; surrogates are elected to 10-year terms except in New York City counties, where they are elected to 14-year terms. Each county has its own family court. In New York City, judges are appointed by the mayor for 10-year terms; elsewhere they are elected for 10 years. A county's district attorney has authority in
criminal matters. Most cities (including New York City) have their own court systems; in New York City, the mayor appoints judges of city criminal and family courts. Village police justices and town justices of the peace handle minor violations and other routine matters.</p><p>The Department of Correctional Services maintains correctional facilities throughout the state, as well as regional parole offices. As of 31 December 2004, a total of 63,751 prisoners were held in New York's state and federal prisons, a decrease from 65,198 of 2.2% from the previous year. As of year-end 2004, a total of 2,789 inmates were female, down from 2,914 or 4.3% from the year before. Among sentenced prisoners (one year or more), New York had an incarceration rate of 331 per 100,000 population in 2004.</p><p>According to the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/federal-bureau-investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>, New York in 2004, had a violent crime rate (murder/nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; aggravated assault) of 441.6 reported incidents per 100,000 population, or a total of 84,914 reported incidents. Crimes against property (burglary; larceny/theft; and motor vehicle theft) in that same year totaled 422,734 reported incidents or 2,198.6 reported incidents per 100,000 people. In 1995, the state instituted a new death penalty statute, of which lethal injection was the sole method of execution. However, on 24 June, 2004 New York's death penalty statute was declared unconstitutional. The last execution in the state took place in 1963. As of 1 January 2006, only one inmate remained on the state's death row.</p><p>In 2003, New York spent $4,309,416,130 on homeland security, an average of $236 per state resident.</p><h2>ARMED FORCES</h2><p>The US Military Academy at <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/west-point">West Point</a> was founded in 1802. In 2004, there were 22,714 active-duty military personnel and 11,409 civilian personnel stationed in New York, more than half of whom were at Fort Drum. In 2004, New York firms received more than $5.2 billion in defense contracts. In addition, defense spending outlays, including retires military pay, were $2.4 billion.</p><p>In 2003, there were 1,711,900 veterans of US military service in the state. The statistics for living veterans of wartime service were as follows: World War II, 212,726; Korea, 159,501; Vietnam era, 337,162; and 129,275 from the Persian <a class="interlinked" href="/history/asia-and-africa/middle-eastern-history/gulf-war">Gulf War</a>. For the fiscal year 2004, total Veterans Affairs expenditures in New York exceeded $3.1 billion.</p><p>As of 31 October 2004, the New York State Police employed 4,659 sworn officers.</p><h2>MIGRATION</h2><p>Since the early 1800s, New York has been the primary port of entry for Europeans coming to the United States. The <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/statue-liberty">Statue of Liberty</a><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>dedicated in 1886 and beckoning "your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free" to the shores of America<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>was often the immigrants' first glimpse of America. The first stop for some 20 million immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/ellis-island">Ellis Island</a>, where they were processed, often given Americanized names, and sent onward to an uncertain future.</p><p>The first great wave of European immigrants arrived in the 1840s, impelled by the potato famine in Ireland. By 1850, New York City had 133,730 Irish-born inhabitants, and by 1890, 409,224. Although smaller in number, German immigration during this period was more widespread; during the 1850s, German-speaking people were the largest foreign-born group in Rochester and Buffalo, and by 1855 about 30,000 of Buffalo's 74,000 residents were German.</p><p>The next two great waves of European immigration<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>Eastern European Jews and Italians<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>overlapped. Vast numbers of Jews began arriving from <a class="interlinked" href="/history/historians-and-chronicles/historians-european/eastern-europe">Eastern Europe</a> during the 1880s, by which time some 80,000 German-speaking Jews were already living in New York City. By 1910, the Jewish population of the city was about 1,250,000, growing to nearly 2,000,000 by the mid-1920s. The flood of Italians began during the 1800s, when the Italian population of New York City increased from 75,000 to more than 200,000; in 1950, nearly 500,000 Italian-born immigrants were living in the state. Migration from the 1840s onward followed a cyclical pattern: as one group dispersed from New York City throughout the state and the nation, it was replaced by a new wave of immigrants.</p><p>Yankees from New England made up the first great wave of domestic migration. Most of the migrants who came to New York between l790 and 1840 were Yankees; it has been estimated that by 1850, 52,000 natives of Vermont (20% of that state's population) had become residents of New York. There was a slow, steady migration of <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/african-americans">African Americans</a> from slave states to New York before the Civil War, but massive black migration to New York, and especially to New York City, began during World War I and continued well into the 1960s. The third great wave of domestic migration came after World War II, from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/caribbean-political-geography/puerto-rico">Puerto Rico</a>. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>53. By 1960, the census showed well over 600,000 New Yorkers of Puerto Rican birth or parentage. As of 1990, Puerto Rican-born New Yorkers numbered 143,974. Nearly 41,800 state residents in 1990 had lived in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/caribbean-political-geography/puerto-rico">Puerto Rico</a> in 1985. Many other Caribbean natives<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>especially Dominicans, Jamaicans, and Haitians<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>followed. In 1996, there were a reported 3,232,000 state residents who were foreign-born (about 17% of the state's population). In 1998, 96,559 foreign immigrants entered New York, the second-highest total of any state (surpassed only by California) and over 15% of the total immigration for that year.</p><p>The fourth and most recent domestic migratory trend is unique in New York history<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the net outward migration from New York to other states. During the 1960s, New York suffered a net loss of more than 100,000 residents through migration; between 1970 and 1980, the estimated net loss was probably in excess of 1,500,000, far greater than that in any other state: probably 80% of the migration was from New York City. From 1980 to 1990, net loss from migration exceeded 340,000. Between 1990 and 1998, New York had a net loss of 1,722,000 in domestic migration. These general estimates hide a racial movement of historic proportions: during the 1960s, while an estimated net total of 638,000 whites were moving out of the state, 396,000 blacks were moving in; during 1970<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>75, according to Census Bureau estimates, 701,000 whites left New York, while 60,000 blacks were arriving. According to a private study, a net total of 700,000 whites and 50,000 blacks left the state during 1975<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>80. It appears that many of the white emigrants went to suburban areas of New Jersey and Connecticut, but many also went to two Sunbelt states, Florida and California. Overwhelmingly, the black arrivals came from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/south">the South</a>. During the 1980s, the black population of the New York City area in-creased by 16.4%. By 1997, blacks comprised 19.4% of the New York City area's total population.</p><p>Intrastate migration has followed the familiar pattern of rural to urban, urban to suburban. In 1790, the state was 88% rural; the rural population grew in absolute terms (though not as a percentage of the total state population) until the 1880s when the long period of decline began. New York's farm population decreased by 21% during the 1940s, 33% during the 1950s, 38% during the 1960s, and 49% during the 1970s. By 1990, 84% of all New Yorkers lived in urban areas; by 1996, 91.8%. Meanwhile, the suburban population has grown steadily. In 1950, 3,538,620 New Yorkers (24% of the state total) lived in suburbs; by 1980, this figure had grown to 7,461,161 (42% of all state residents). It should be remembered, of course, that this more than doubling of the suburban population reflects natural increase and direct migration from other states and regions, as well as the intrastate migratory movement from central cities to suburbs. Between 1990 and 1998, New York's overall population only increased by 1%.</p><p>In the period 2000<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>05, net international migration was 667,007 and net internal migration was <span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2212;</span>1,001,100, for a net loss of 334,093 people.</p><h2>INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION</h2><p>New York State is a member of the Council of State Governments and its allied organizations. The state participates in many interstate regional commissions (and in commissions with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec). Among the more active interstate commissions are the Appalachian Regional Commission, Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, Delaware River Basin Commission, Great Lakes Commission, Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Commission, and the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission. In 1985, New York joined seven other Great Lakes states and two Canadian provinces in the Great Lakes Charter, for the purpose of protecting the lakes' water reserves.</p><p>The three most important interstate bodies for the New York metropolitan area are the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, Interstate Sanitation Commission, and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission was founded in 1900 (with New Jersey) in order to preserve the natural beauty of the Palisades region. The Interstate Sanitation Commission (with New Jersey and Connecticut; established in 1961) monitors and seeks to control pollution within the tri-state Interstate Sanitation District. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, created in 1921 and the most powerful of the three, is a public corporation with the power to issue its own bonds. Its vast holdings include 4 bridges, 2 tunnels, 5 airports and heliports, 2 motor vehicle terminals, 6 marine terminals, the trans-Hudson <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/technology/technology-terms-and-concepts/rapid-transit">rapid transit</a> system, an industrial park in the Bronx, and the 110-story twin-towered World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, until it was destroyed in 2001. Bridge compacts include those on the Buffalo and Fort Erie bridge, the Ogdensburg bridge and port, and the Canada and New York International bridge. Other compacts include the New York-Connecticut Railroad Service, and the Susquehanna River Basin Compact (with Maryland and Pennsylvania). Federal grants to New York state and local governments totaled $38.313 billion in fiscal year 2005, higher than any other state except California. In fiscal year 2006, New York received an estimated $40.606 billion in federal grants, and an estimated $41.817 billion in fiscal year 2007.</p><h2>ECONOMY</h2><p>From the Civil War through the 1950s, New York State led the nation in just about every category by which an economy can be measured. In the colonial and early national periods, New York was a leading wheat-growing state. When the wheat crop declined, dairying and lumbering became the state's mainstays. New York then emerged as the national leader in wholesaling, retailing, and manufacturing<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>and remained so well into the 1960s.</p><p>By 1973, however, the state was running neck and neck with California by most output measures, or had already been surpassed. The total labor force, the number of workers in manufacturing, and the number of factories all declined during the 1960s and 1970s. New York City's manufacturing base and its skilled laborers have been emigrating to the suburbs and to other states since World War II. Between 1969 and 1976, the city lost 600,000 jobs. With the departure of much of the middle class, the city's tax base shrank, a factor that contributed to the fiscal crisis of 1975, when a package of short-term aid from Congress, the state government, and the labor union pension funds saved the city from default.</p><p>The 1980s saw the state's fortunes on the rise. A shift in dependence from manufacturing to services, and particularly to finance, helped the state and New York City weather the 1981<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>82 recession. In 1983, the state's three largest industrial and commercial employers (excluding public utilities) were all banks based in New York City. From 1980 to 1990, the state's economy acquired approximately one million jobs, in contrast to 50,000 the previous decade. Financial services led the city's economic expansion, adding 100,000 jobs from 1980 to 1987. Long Island also experienced growth in the first half of the decade, benefiting from the defense build-up by the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts-28">federal government</a> in the early and mid-eighties.</p><p>New York's economy not only grew during the eighties but also underwent a restructuring. Manufacturing witnessed a decline in its share of total employment from 20% in 1980 to 14% in 1990. Apparel, industrial machinery and equipment, and primary metals accounted for 40% of the total loss of jobs. Industrial output, however, increased 10.1% between 1980 and 1987. Productivity gains produced both the rise in output and the decline in employment. Construction boomed from 1982<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>89, increasing its share of employment from 2.9% to 3.8%. The service sector, particularly business-related, health care, education and social services grew 52% in the decade, increasing services' share of employment from 24% in 1980 to 29% in 1990. Finance, insurance, and the real estate industry expanded 64%. The surge in financial services employment ended with the crash of the stock market in October of 1987, in which stock prices dropped 36% in two months. The crash prompted the layoff of 9,000 employees on Wall Street and a downsizing of the banking and securities industries. More than $1 trillion in financial transactions took place per day on the NYSE in 2000.</p><p>About one in 11 New York City residents received some form of public assistance (including Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income benefits) in 1994. The high number of people on welfare
prompted the New York State government to turn the welfare program into a "workfare" program that put the able-bodied to work. By 1998, the welfare roles had been reduced by over 600,000 from 1995 numbers, a 35% decrease. Job growth rose steadily through the 1990s. Coming into the 21st century, the state economy was growing briskly, with annual growth rates of 8.3% in 1998, 3.5% in 1999, and 7.3% in 2000. Even in the national recession of 2001, and with the events of 9/11, the state economy posted 3.5% annual growth. Employment growth in the state lagged the nation as a whole during 2001 and 2002, but was close to the national average by the end of 2002. New York City's rate of job losses, however, continued to exceed the state and the nation. However, office vacancy rates in New York City in the fourth quarter 2002, at 8% for midtown, and 12% for downtown (where the twin World Trade Center towers had been located), were well below the national average of 16.5%. The state's manufacturing sector, which had been contracting for decades, fell from 10.8% of gross state product in 1997 to 9.4% of the total in 2001. In 2002, the highest percentages of manufacturing job losses were in the cities of Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.</p><p>New York's gross state product (GSP) in 2004 was $896.739 billion, of which the real estate sector accounted for the largest share at $114.056 billion or 12.7% of GSP, followed by professional and technical services at $75.337 billion (8.4% of GSP), and health care and social assistance services at 70.059 billion (7.8% of GSP). In that same year, there were an estimated 1,779,932 small businesses in New York. Of the 481,858 businesses that had employees, an estimated total of 477,260 or 99% were small companies. An estimated 62,854 new businesses were established in the state in 2004, up 3.8% from the year before. Business terminations that same year came to 64,013, up 4.6% from 2003. There were 4,070 business bankruptcies in 2004, up 104.8% from the previous year. In 2005, the state's personal bankruptcy (Chapter 7 and Chapter 13) filing rate was 385 filings per 100,000 people, ranking New York as the 42nd highest in the nation.</p><h2>INCOME</h2><p>In 2005 New York had a gross state product (GSP) of $963 billion which accounted for 7.8% of the nation's <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/economics-terms-and-concepts/gross-domestic">gross domestic product</a> and placed the state at number 3 in highest GSP among the 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in 2004 New York had a per capita personal income (PCPI) of $38,264. This ranked sixth in the United States and was 116% of the national average of $33,050. The 1994<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>2004 average annual growth rate of PCPI was 4.0%. New York had a total personal income (TPI) of $737,755,932,000, which ranked second in the United States and reflected an increase of 6.7% from 2003. The 1994<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>2004 average annual growth rate of TPI was 4.5%. Earnings of persons employed in New York increased from $558,688,257,000 in 2003 to $596,716,261,000 in 2004, an increase of 6.8%. The 2003<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>04 national change was 6.3%.</p><p>The US Census Bureau reports that the three-year average median household income for 2002<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>04 in 2004 dollars was $44,228 compared to a national average of $44,473. During the same period an estimated 14.4% of the population was below the poverty line as compared to 12.4% nationwide.</p><h2>LABOR</h2><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in April 2006 the seasonally adjusted civilian labor force in New York numbered 9,516,800, with approximately 467,000 workers unemployed, yielding an unemployment rate of 4.9%, compared to the national average of 4.7% for the same period. Preliminary data for the same period placed nonfarm employment at 8,583,500. Since the beginning of the BLS data series in 1976, the highest unemployment rate recorded in New York was 10.5% in July 1976. The historical low was 4% in April 1988. Preliminary nonfarm employment data by occupation for April 2006 showed that approximately 3.8% of the labor force was employed in construction; 6.5% in manufacturing; 17.5% in trade, transportation, and public utilities; 8.4% in financial activities; 12.7% in professional and business services; 18.2% in education and health services; 7.8% in leisure and hospitality services; and 17.3% in government.</p><p>The labor force participation rate of women increased from 42.0% in 1974 to 55.8% in 1998. Over the same period, participation rates for men declined from 75.9% to 71.4%. Among minority groups, the unemployment rate in 1998 was 11.4% for blacks and 8.9% for Hispanics.</p><p>At the turn of the century, working conditions in New York were among the worst in the country. The flood of immigrants into the labor market and the absence of labor laws to protect them led to the development in New York City of cramped, ill-lit, poorly ventilated, and unhealthy factories<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the sweatshops for which the garment industry became notorious. Since that time working conditions in the garment factories have improved, primarily through the efforts of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union and, later, its sister organization, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textiles Workers Union.</p><p>Under the state's Taylor Law, public employees do not have the right to strike. Penalties for striking may be exacted against both the unions and their leaders.</p><p>The BLS reported that in 2005, a total of 2,090,000 of New York's 8,008,000 employed wage and salary workers were formal members of a union. This represented 26.1% of those so employed, up from 25.3% in 2004, and well above the national average of 12%. Overall in 2005, a total of 2,201,000 workers (27.5%) in New York were covered by a union or employee association contract, which includes those workers who reported no union affiliation. New York is one of five states whose union membership rate is greater than 20%. The New York is also one of 28 states that does not have a right-to-work law.</p><p>As of 1 March 2006, New York had a state-mandated <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/labor/minimum-wage">minimum wage</a> rate of $6.75 per hour, which will increase to $7.15 per hour on 1 January 2007. In 2004, women in the state accounted for 47% of the employed civilian labor force.</p><h2>AGRICULTURE</h2><p>New York ranked 28th in farm income in 2005, with cash receipts from farming at over $3.5 billion. About 62% came from livestock products, mostly dairy goods. In 2004, the state ranked second in apples, third in the production of corn for silage, third in cauliflower, fourth in tart cherries and snap beans, and ninth in oats.</p><p>Corn was the leading crop for the Indians and for the European settlers of the early colonial period. During the early 1800s, how-ever, wheat was the major crop grown in eastern New York. With the opening of the Erie Canal, western New York (especially the Genesee Valley) became a major wheat-growing center as well. By the late 1850s, when the state's wheat crop began to decline, New York still led the nation in barley, flax, hops, and potato production and was a significant grower of corn and oats. The opening of the railroads took away the state's competitive advantage, but as grain production shifted to the Midwest, the state emerged as a leading supplier of meat and dairy products.</p><p>New York remains an important dairy state, but urbanization has reduced its overall agricultural potential. In 2004, 14% of the state's land area was devoted to crop growing; in 2004, there were only 36,000 farms, with 7.6 million acres (3.1 million hectares).</p><p>The west-central part of the state is the most intensively farmed. Chautauqua County, in the extreme southwest, leads the state in grape production, while Wayne County, along Lake Ontario, leads in apples and cherries. The dairy industry is concentrated in the St. Lawrence Valley; grain growing dominates the plains between Syracuse and Buffalo. Potatoes are grown mostly in Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island.</p><p>Leading filed crops in 2004 included hay, of which 2.9 million tons were produced, worth $327 million; corn, 61 million bushels worth $146.4 million; oats, 3.3 million bushels worth $5.5 million; and wheat, 5.3 million bushels, worth $13.8 million.</p><p>Farms in 2004 also produced 941,010 tons of commercial vegetables. Leading vegetable crops were cabbage, onions, sweet corn, and snap beans. State vineyards produced 145,000 tons of grapes for wine and juice in 2004, while the apple crop totaled 1.1 billion lb.</p><h2>ANIMAL HUSBANDRY</h2><p>The St. Lawrence Valley is the state's leading cattle-raising region, followed by the Mohawk Valley and Wyoming County, in western New York. The poultry industry is more widely dispersed. In 2005, an estimated 1.41 million cattle and calves were worth around $1.73 billion. There were an estimated 84,000 hogs and pigs, worth $8.4 million in 2004. During 2003, around 14.6 million lb (6.6 million kg) of broilers were produced, worth $5.1 million, and 13.3 million lb (6 million kg) of turkey, worth $4.8 million.</p><p>New York is a leading dairy state. In 2003, New York was third in the United States in milk production with 11.9 million lb (5.4 million kg) of milk from 671,000 milk cows.</p><p>Also during 2003, New York farmers produced around 3 million lb (1.4 million kg) of sheep and lambs, which brought in around $2.7 million in gross income. The state produced around 1.05 billion eggs, valued at $56.3 million in 2003. Duck raising is an industry of local importance on Long Island.</p><h2>FISHING</h2><p>Fishing, though an attraction for tourists and sportsmen, plays only a marginal role in the economic life of the state. In 2004, the Atlantic commercial catch by New York fishers was 33.7 million lb (15.3 million kg), valued at $46.4 million. The Great Lakes commercial catch the same year was 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) valued at $11,000. Important species for commercial use are clams and oysters. In 2004, the state ranked second in the nation (after New Jersey) in volume of surf clams (6.8 million lb/3.1 million kg) and third for soft clams (234,000 lb/106,000 kg). Virtually all of New York's commercial fishing takes place in the Atlantic waters off Long Island. Montauk, on the eastern end of Long Island, is the state's leading fishing port. In 2003, there were 6 processing and 271 wholesale plants in the state with about 2,154 employees.</p><p>Pollution and poor wildlife management have seriously endangered the state's commercial and sport fishing in the ocean, rivers, and lakes. Commercial fishing for striped bass in the Hudson River was banned in 1976 because of contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Commercial fishing in the river for five other species<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>black crappie, brown bullhead, carp, goldfish, and pumpkinseed<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>was banned in 1985. Also banned in 1985 was commercial fishing for striped bass in New York Harbor and along both shores of western Long Island.</p><p>In recent decades, however, the Department of Environmental Conservation has taken an active role in restocking New York's inland waters. The US Fish and Wildlife Service distributes large numbers of lake trout and Atlantic salmon fingerlings and rainbow and brook trout fry throughout the state. There are 12 state hatcheries producing over 1 million lb (over 453,000 kg) of fish per year, including brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, lake trout, steelhead, chinook salmon, coho salmon, landlocked salmon, walleye, muskellunge, and tiger muskellunge.</p><p>In 2004, the state issued 983,812 sport fishing licenses.</p><h2>FORESTRY</h2><p>About 61% of New York's surface area is forestland. The most densely forested counties are Hamilton, Essex, and Warren in the Adirondacks, and Delaware, Greene, and Ulster in the Catskills. The total forested area was about 18,432,000 acres (7,459,000 hectares) in 2004, of which 15,389,000 acres (6,228,000 hectares) were classified as commercial forest, meaning they were available for the harvest of wood products such as sawlogs, veneer, and pulpwood or firewood. In 2004, lumber production totaled 480 million board feet.</p><p>Finger Lakes National Forest, the only national forest within the state, covered 16,211 acres (6,560 hectares) in 2005. The state Department of Environmental Conservation manages about 3,000,000 acres (1,200,000 hectares) in the Catskills and Adirondacks as Forest Preserves, and an additional 800,000 acres in State Forests and Wildlife Management Areas (where timber harvesting is allowed as part of their management plans).</p><h2>MINING</h2><p>According to preliminary data from the US Geological Survey (USGS), the estimated value of nonfuel mineral production by New York in 2003 was $978 million, a decrease from $991 million in 2002. The USGS data ranked New York as 14th among the 50 states by the total value of its nonfuel mineral production, accounting for over 2.5% of total US output.</p><p>According to the preliminary data for 2003, crushed stone, followed by cement (portland and masonry), salt, construction sand and gravel, and wollastonite were the state's top nonfuel minerals by value. Collectively, these five commodities accounted for around 98% of all nonfuel mineral output, by value. About 75% of the state's nonfuel minerals, by value, were major construction material commodities: cement, common clays, construction sand and gravel, and crushed stone. New York in 2003 was the nation's
only producer of wollastonite. The state also ranked third in salt, fourth in talc, and tenth in portland and masonry cement. New York was the leading state (out of two) in the production of industrial grade garnets and eighth in the production of dimension stone.</p><p>Preliminary data for 2003 showed that New York's production of crushed stone totaled 51.5 million metric tons, with a value of $358 million, while output of salt totaled 4.9 million metric tons, valued at $190 million. Construction sand and gravel production in that same year came to 32 million metric tons, and was valued at $171 million. Common clays output totaled 641,000 metric tons and was valued at $7.99 million.</p><p>Other commodities produced in New York included gypsum and peat. Major uses of wollastonite (a type of calcium silicate) are as a filler in ceramic tile, marine wallboard, paint, plastics, and refractory liners in steel mills.</p><h2>ENERGY AND POWER</h2><p>As of 2003, New York had 96 electrical power service providers, of which 48 were publicly owned and four were cooperatives. Of the remainder, nine were investor owned, three were owners of independent generators that sold directly to customers, 25 were generation-only suppliers and seven were delivery-only providers. As of that same year there were 7,876,995 retail customers. Of that total, 6,245,232 received their power from investor-owned service providers. Cooperatives accounted for 16,816 customers, while publicly owned providers had 1,243,176 customers. There were 1,867 independent generator or "facility" customers, and 369,904 generation-only customers. There was no data on the number of delivery-only customers.</p><p>Total net summer generating capability by the state's electrical generating plants in 2003 stood at 36.696 million k W, with total production that same year at 137.643 billion kWh. Of the total amount generated, 30.2% came from electric utilities, with the remaining 69.8% coming from independent producers and combined heat and power service providers. The largest portion of all electric power generated, 40.697 billion kWh (29.6%), came from nuclear power generation, with <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/chemistry/organic-chemistry/natural-gas">natural gas</a> fueled plants in second place at 28.156 billion kWh (20.5%) and hydroelectric plants in third at 24.268 billion kWh (17.6%). Other renewable power sources, coal and petroleum fired plants (17.1% and 14%, respectively) and pumped storage facilities accounted for the remaining power generated.</p><p>Electric bills for New York City are the highest in the nation, and customers in Buffalo and Rochester also pay above the national median. Sales of public and private electric power totaled 144.045 billion kWh in 2003, of which 50.3% went to commercial users, 15.1% to industrial purchasers, 32.7% to residential users, and 1.9% for transportation.</p><p>As of 2006, New York had four operating nuclear power stations: the James A. Fitzpatrick and the Nile Mile Point plants, both near Oswego; the Indian Point plant in Westchester County; and the Robert E. Ginna plant near Rochester.</p><p>As of 2004, New York had proven crude oil reserves of less than 1% of all proven US reserves, while output that same year averaged 464 barrels per day. Including federal offshore domains, the state that year ranked 29th (28th excluding federal offshore) in production among the 31 producing states. In 2004 New York had 3,095 producing oil wells and accounted for under 1% of all US production. There are no refineries in the state of New York.</p><p>In 2004, New York had 5,781 producing <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/chemistry/organic-chemistry/natural-gas">natural gas</a> and gas condensate wells. In that same year, marketed gas production (all gas produced excluding gas used for repressuring, vented and flared, and nonhydrocarbon gases removed) totaled 36.137 billion cu ft (1.02 billion cu m). As of 31 December 2004, proven reserves of dry or consumer-grade natural gas totaled 324 billion cu ft (9.2 billion cu m).</p><h2>INDUSTRY</h2><p>Until the 1970s, New York was the nation's foremost industrial state, ranking first in virtually every general category. However, US Commerce Department data show that by 1975 the state had slipped in manufacturing to second in number of employees, payroll, and value added, fourth in value of shipments of manufactured goods, and sixth in new capital spending. Important sectors are instruments and related products, industrial machinery and equipment, electronic and electric equipment, printing and publishing, and textiles.</p><p>The Buffalo region, with its excellent transport facilities and abundant power supply, is the main center for heavy industry in the state, while light industry is dispersed throughout the state. Rochester is especially well known for its photographic (Kodak) and optical equipment and office machines. The state's leadership in electronic equipment is in large part attributable to the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/international"><a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/international-2">International Business</a> Machines Corp</a>. (IBM), which was founded in 1911 at Endicott, near Binghamton. The presence of two large General Electric plants has long made Schenectady a leader in the manufacture of electric machinery.</p><p>New York City excels not only in the apparel and publishing trades but also in food processing, meat packing, chemicals, leather goods, metal products, and many other manufactures. In addition, the city serves as headquarters for many large industrial corporations whose manufacturing activities often take place entirely outside New York.</p><p>According to the US Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) for 2004, New York's manufacturing sector covered some 21 product subsectors. The shipment value of all products manufactured in the state that same year was $146.691 billion. Of that total, chemical manufacturing accounted for the largest share at $35.291 billion. It was followed by computer and electronic product manufacturing at $14.565 billion; food manufacturing at $14.090 billion; transport equipment manufacturing at $11.717 billion; machinery manufacturing at $10.449 billion; and miscellaneous manufacturing at $9.031 billion.</p><p>In 2004, a total of 569,641 people in New York were employed in the state's manufacturing sector, according to the ASM. Of that total, 370,674 were actual production workers. In terms of total employment, the computer and electronic product manufacturing industry accounted for the largest portion of all manufacturing employees at 65,291, with 29,738 actual production workers. It was followed by chemical manufacturing at 57,004 employees (28,401 actual production workers); fabricated metal product manufacturing at 55,711 employees (39,809 actual production workers); miscellaneous manufacturing at 47,587 employees (31,212 actual production workers); and food manufacturing with 46,847 employees (31,160 actual production workers).</p><p>ASM data for 2004 showed that New York's manufacturing sector paid $24.145 billion in wages. Of that amount, the computer and electronic product manufacturing sector accounted for the largest share at $3.713 billion. It was followed by chemical manufacturing at $2.874 billion; fabricated metal product manufacturing at $2.193 billion; machinery manufacturing at $2030 billion; transport equipment manufacturing at $1.989 billion; and miscellaneous manufacturing at $1.708 billion.</p><h2>COMMERCE</h2><p>According to the 2002 Census of Wholesale Trade, New York's wholesale trade sector had sales that year totaling $343.6 billion from 35,845 establishments. Wholesalers of durable goods accounted for 18,400 establishments, followed by nondurable goods wholesalers at 15,236 and electronic markets, agents, and brokers accounting for 2,209 establishments. Sales by durable goods wholesalers in 2002 totaled $127.7 billion, while wholesalers of nondurable goods saw sales of $184.6 billion. Electronic markets, agents, and brokers in the wholesale trade industry had sales of $31.2 billion.</p><p>In the 2002 Census of Retail Trade, New York was listed as having 76,425 retail establishments with sales of $178.06 billion. The leading types of retail businesses by number of establishments were: food and beverage stores (15,210); clothing and clothing accessories stores (12,531); miscellaneous store retailers (8,346); and health and personal care stores (6,648). In terms of sales, motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts stores accounted for the largest share of retail sales at $37.3 billion, followed by food and beverage stores at $29.6 billion; general merchandise stores at $19.7 billion; clothing and clothing accessories stores at $17.2 billion; and health and personal care stores at $16.2 billion. A total of 837,806 people were employed by the retail sector in New York that year.</p><p>The state's long border with Canada, its important ports on Lakes Erie and Ontario, and its vast harbor on New York Bay ensure it a major role in US foreign trade. About one-quarter of US waterborne imports and exports pass through the New York Customs District (including New York City, Albany, and Newark and Perth Amboy, N.J.). Exports of goods from New York totaled $50.4 billion in 2005, third among the states.</p><h2>CONSUMER PROTECTION</h2><p>The New York State Consumer Protection Board (CPB) was created in 1970, and is headed by an executive director appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. The CPB is divided into three organizations: the Consumer Assistance Unit; the Law and Investigations Unit; and the Office of Strategic Programs (which in turn is composed of an Outreach and Education Unit, and a Utility Intervention Unit). The Board coordinates the activities of all state agencies performing consumer protection functions, represents consumer interests before federal, state, and local bodies (including the Public Service Commission), and encourages consumer education and research, but it has no enforcement powers. These are vested in the Bureau of Consumer Frauds and Protection within the Department of Law, under the direction of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/law/attorney-general">Attorney General</a>. The Department of Public Service has regulatory authority over several areas of key interest to consumers, including gas, electric, and telephone rates.</p><p>State law outlaws unfair or deceptive trade practices and provides for small-claims courts, where consumers can take action at little cost to themselves. New York licenses and regulates automobile repair services, permits advertising of prescription drug prices, and requires unit pricing. A "cooling-off" period for home purchase contracts is mandated, and standards have been established for mobile-home construction. New York also has no-fault automobile insurance. In 1974, the legislature outlawed sex discrimination in banking, credit, and insurance policy transactions. The state's fair-trade law, which allowed price fixing on certain items, was repealed in 1975. The Fair Credit Reporting Act passed in 1977, allows consumers access to their credit bureau files. A 1984 "Lemon Law" entitles purchasers of defective new cars to repairs, a refund, or a replacement under specified circumstances. A similar law for used cars requires a written warranty for most essential mechanical components.</p><p>When dealing with consumer protection issues, New York's <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/law/law/attorney-general">Attorney General</a> can initiate civil and criminal proceedings; represent the state before state and federal regulatory agencies; administer consumer protection and education programs; handle formal consumer complaints; and exercise broad subpoena powers. In antitrust actions, the Attorney General can act on behalf of those consumers who are incapable of acting on their own; initiate damage actions on behalf of the state in state courts; initiate criminal proceedings; and represent counties, cities and other governmental entities in recovering civil damages under state or federal law.</p><p>The offices of the New York State Consumer Protection Board are located in Albany. The offices of the Bureau of Consumer Frauds and Protection are located in Albany and in New York City. The Office of the Attorney General has regional offices in Binghamton, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Hauppauge, Mineola, Harlem (New York City), Plattsburgh, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Watertown and in White Plains. <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/county-government">County government</a> consumer affairs offices are located in Albany, Buffalo, Carmel, Goshen, Kingston, Mineola, Monticello, New York City, Poughkeepsie, Schenectady, and White Plains. City government consumer affairs offices are located in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/mount-vernon">Mount Vernon</a>, New York City, Newtonville, Schenectady, and in Yonkers.</p><h2>BANKING</h2><p>New York City is the major US banking center. Banking is one of the state's leading industries, ranking first in the United States. As of June 2005, the state of New York had 209 insured banks, savings and loans, and saving banks, plus 32 state-chartered and 519 federally chartered credit unions (CUs). Excluding the CUs, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island market area accounted for the largest portion of the state's financial institutions and deposits in 2004, with 233 institutions and $770.488 billion in deposits. As of June 2005, CUs accounted for 2.9% of all assets held by all financial institutions in the state, or some $36.484 billion. Banks, savings and loans, and savings banks collectively accounted for the remaining 97.1% or $1,202.550 billion in assets held.</p><p>In 2004, the state's insured banks reported a median past-due/nonaccrual loan to total loans percentage of1.20%, down from 1.46% in 2003. The median net interest margin (the difference between the lower rates offered to savers and the higher rates charged on loans) in 2004 was 3.77%, down slightly from 3.78% in 2003.</p><p>New York has a higher percentage of residential mortgage lenders than the rest of the nation, and its median ratio of long-term assets-to-average earning assets remains above that of the nation.</p><p>Regulation of state-chartered banks and other financial institutions is the responsibility of the New York State Banking Department. It was established in 1851 and is the oldest bank regulatory body in the United States.</p><h2>INSURANCE</h2><p>Like banking, insurance is <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/big-business">big business</a> in New York. Three of the ten top US life insurance companies<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>Metropolitan Life, New York Life, and Equitable Life Assurance<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>had their headquarters in New York.</p><p>As of 2003, there were 195 property and casualty and 186 life and <a class="interlinked" href="/medicine/divisions-diagnostics-and-procedures/medicine/health-insurance">health insurance</a> companies domiciled in the state. Direct premiums for property and casualty insurance totaled over $33.3 billion in 2004. That year, there were 100,121 flood insurance policies in force in the state, with a total value of $17.5 billion. About $11 billion of coverage was held through FAIR plans, which are designed to offer coverage for some natural circumstances, such as wind and hail, in high risk areas.</p><p>In 2004, New Yorkers held over 9 million individual life insurance policies with a value of about $999 billion; total value for all categories of life insurance (individual, group, and credit) was $1.6 trillion. The average coverage amount is $110,100 per policy holder. Death benefits paid that year totaled $3.8 billion.</p><p>In 2004, 53% of state residents held employment-based <a class="interlinked" href="/medicine/divisions-diagnostics-and-procedures/medicine/health-insurance">health insurance</a> policies, 3% held individual policies, and 28% were covered under <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/economics-terms-and-concepts/medicare-and">Medicare and Medicaid</a>; 15% of residents were uninsured. In 2003, employee contributions for employment-based health coverage averaged at 17% for single coverage and 19% for family coverage. The state offers an 18-month health benefits expansion program for small-firm employees in connection with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA, 1986), a health insurance program for those who lose employment-based coverage due to termination or reduction of work hours.</p><p>In 2003, there were over 9 million auto insurance policies in effect for private passenger cars. Required minimum coverage includes bodily injury liability of up to $25,000 per individual and $50,000 for all persons injured in an accident, as well as property damage liability of $10,000. Personal injury protection is also required. In 2003, the average expenditure per vehicle for insurance coverage was $1,160.80, which ranked as the second-highest average in the nation (following New Jersey).</p><h2>SECURITIES</h2><p>The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is by far the largest organized securities market in the nation and the world. The exchange began as an agreement among 24 brokers, known as the Buttonwood Agreement, in 1792; the exchange adopted its first constitution in 1817 and took on its present name in 1863. A clear sign of the growth of the NYSE is the development of its communications system. Stock tickers were first introduced in 1867; a faster ticker, installed in 1930, was capable of printing 500 characters a minute. By 1964, this was no longer fast enough, and a 900-character-a-minute ticker was introduced. Annual registered share volume increased from 1.8 billion in 1965 to 7.6 billion in 1978 following the introduction in 1976 of a new data line capable of handling 36,000 characters a minute. In August 2000, the NYSE switched to a <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/mathematics/mathematics/decimal-system">decimal system</a>. The New York Futures Exchange was incorporated in 1979 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the NYSE and began trading in 1980. It also deals in options on futures. In 2006, The NYSE merged with Archipelago Holdings (ArcaEx and the Pacific Exchange) to form the for-profit NYSE Group, Inc. As of 2005, there were about 2,672 issuers listed on the NYSE, including about 453 foreign companies. NYSE listed companies represent a total global market value of $21 trillion.</p><p>The American Stock Exchange (AMEX) is the second-leading US securities floor-based market, but the AMEX ranks far below the NYSE in both volume and value of securities. The AMEX traces its origins to the outdoor trading in unlisted securities that began on Wall and Hanover streets in the 1840s, the exchange was organized as the New York Curb Agency in 1908; the exchange moved indoors, but continued to use the hand signals developed by outdoor traders. The AMEX adopted its current name in 1953. Constitutional changes in 1976 for the first time permitted qualified issues to be traded on both the AMEX and the NYSE as well as on other exchanges. This Intermarket Trading System (ITS) began in 1978. In 1996, the hand signals used in trading on the AMEX for over 100 years were replaced by a computerized communication system. AMEX has about 661 regular trading members, and 203 options members.</p><p>The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ), created in 1971, is a highly active exchange for over-the-counter securities. New York City is also a major center for trading in commodity futures. Leading commodity exchanges are the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange; the New York Cocoa Exchange; the New York Cotton Exchange; the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), specializing in gold, silver, and copper futures; and the New York Mercantile Exchange, which trades in futures for potatoes, platinum, palladium, silver coins, beef, and gold, among other items. Bonds may be issued in New York by cities, counties, towns, villages, school districts, and fire districts, as well as by quasi-independent authorities.</p><p>In 2005, there were 16,530 personal financial advisers employed in the state and 34,860 securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents. In 2004, there were over 1,097 publicly traded companies within the state, with over 280 XX NASDAQ companies, 378 NYSE listings, and 114 AMEX listings. In 2006, the state had 55 Fortune 500 companies, including 20 companies in the Fortune 100; Citigroup ranked first in the state and eighth in the nation with revenues of over $131 billion, followed by American Intl. Group (ninth), Intl. Business Machines (10th), <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/jp-morgan">J.P. Morgan</a> Chase and Co. (17th), and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/verizon">Verizon Communications</a> (18th). All five if these companies are listed on the NYSE.</p><h2>PUBLIC FINANCE</h2><p>New York State has the second largest budget (behind California), of all states in the United States.</p><p>The New York State budget is prepared by the Division of the Budget and submitted annually by the governor to the legislature for amendment and approval.

Through Empire State Development (ESD), New York State provides a full range of technical assistance. Representatives of the ESD call on firms in Canada, Asia, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/south-american-political-geography/latin-america">Latin America</a>, and Europe; the division maintains offices in London, Tokyo, Montreal, Toronto, Jerusalem, and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/military-affairs-nonnaval/mexico-city">Mexico City</a>. The ESD, through its ten regional offices, encourages the retention and expansion of existing facilities and the attraction of new job-creating investments. Other divisions aid small business and minority and women's business.</p><p>The state administers a number of financial programs to attract or retain businesses. Among these are low interest loans and grants
for small businesses or for firms that create substantial numbers of jobs; grants and low cost loans for the development of industrial parks; and working capital loans to help companies at risk of downsizing. The state awards both grants and loans to manufacturing companies to encourage productivity improvements and modernization. It also seeks to encourage economic development in distressed rural communities with low interest loans for small businesses located in such areas. To promote technological innovation, the state provides debt and equity financing for technology based start-up companies.</p><p>In 2002, the ESD announced that to assist businesses affected by the World Trade Center (WTC) tragedy, it was implementing a $700 million Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) provided by the federal government. The funds were to be made available in the form of loans and grants to affected businesses that committed to job retention, job creation and investment in New York City, with priority on Lower Manhattan. Other WTC assistance programs of the ESD include a Disaster Assistance Program for Individuals, Disaster Recovery Resources for Small Businesses, Liberty Zone Tax Benefits, a New York Liberty Bond Program, and the World Trade Center Relief Fund. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), created after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, was charged with planning and coordinating the rebuilding and revitalization of lower Manhattan.</p><h2>HEALTH</h2><p>Health presents a mixed picture in New York State. The state has some of the finest hospital and medical education facilities in the United States, but it also has large numbers of the needy with serious health problems.</p><p>The infant mortality rate in October 2005 was estimated at 5.8 per 1,000 live births. The birth rate in 2003 was 13.2 per 1,000 population. The abortion rate stood at 39.1 per 1,000 women in 2000, representing the second-highest rate in the country (following the District of Columbia). In 2003, about 82.4% of pregnant woman received prenatal care beginning in the first trimester. In 2004, approximately 82% of children received routine immunizations before the age of three.</p><p>The crude death rate in 2003 was 8.1 deaths per 1,000 population. As of 2002, the death rates for major causes of death (per 100,000 resident population) were: <a class="interlinked" href="/medicine/diseases-and-conditions/pathology/heart-disease">heart disease</a>, 295.8; cancer, 191.4; cerebrovascular diseases, 39.8; chronic lower respiratory diseases, 36.4; and diabetes, 20.5. The mortality rate from HIV infection was 10.3 per 100,000 population, representing the third-highest rate in the country (following the District of Columbia and Maryland). In 2004, the reported AIDS case rate was at about 39.7 per 100,000 population, the second-highest rate in the country (following the District of Columbia). In 2002, about 54.4% of the population was considered overweight or obese. As of 2004, about 19.9% of state residents were smokers.</p><p>In 2003, New York had 207 community hospitals with about 64,700 beds. There were about 2.49 million patient admissions that year and 48 million outpatient visits. The average daily inpatient census was about 50,600 patients. The average cost per day for hospital care was $1,402. Also in 2003, there were about 671 certified nursing facilities in the state with 122,633 beds and an overall occupancy rate of about 92.5%. In 2004, it was estimated that about 71.7% of all state residents had received some type of dental care within the year. New York had 401 physicians per 100,000 resident population in 2004 and 854 nurses per 100,000 in 2005. In 2004, there were a total of 14,498 dentists in the state.</p><p>In 2005, the New York-Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia and Cornell ranked seventh on the Honor Roll of Best Hospitals 2005 by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>. In the same report, it also ranked fifth for best pediatric care and seventh for best care in <a class="interlinked" href="/medicine/diseases-and-conditions/pathology/heart-disease">heart disease</a> and heart surgery. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ranked first in the nation for cancer care.</p><p>About 24% of state residents were enrolled in Medicaid programs in 2003; 14% were enrolled in Medicare programs in 2004. Approximately 15% of the state population was uninsured in 2004. In 2003, state health care expenditures totaled $44.5 million.</p><h2>SOCIAL WELFARE</h2><p>A 1938 New York constitutional provision mandated that the care and support of the needy shall be a state concern. Social welfare is a major public enterprise in the state; the growth of poverty relief programs has been enormous. In 2004, about 513,000 people received unemployment benefits, with the average weekly unemployment benefit at $271. For 2005, the estimated average monthly participation in the food stamp program included about 1,754,861 persons (915,703 households); the average monthly benefit was about $101.43 per person. That year, the total of benefits paid through the state for the food stamp program was over $2.1 billion.</p><p>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the system of federal welfare assistance that officially replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1997, was reauthorized through the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. TANF is funded through federal block grants that are divided among the states based on an equation involving the number of recipients in each state. New York's TANF program is called the Family Assistance Program (FA). In 2004, the state program had 336,000 recipients; state and federal expenditures on this TANF program totaled $2 billion in fiscal year 2003.</p><p>In December 2004, Social Security benefits were paid to 3,045,290 New York residents. This number included 1,985,530 retired workers, 277,600 widows and widowers, 383,800 disabled workers, 149,780 spouses, and 248,580 children. Social Security beneficiaries represented 15.8% of the total state population and 87.7% of the state's population age 65 and older. Retired workers received an average monthly payment of $1,011; widows and widowers, $947; disabled workers, $943; and spouses, $480. Payments for children of retired workers averaged $490 per month; children of deceased workers, $666; and children of disabled workers, $273. Federal Supplemental Security Income payments in December 2004 went to 626,593 New York residents, averaging $461 a month.</p><h2>HOUSING</h2><p>In 2004, the state had an estimated 7,819,359 housing units, of which 7,087,566 were occupied. That year, the state ranked fourth in the nation for the highest number of housing units (following California, Texas, and Florida). An estimated 3,259,092 units, or 41.6%, are located in New York City (NYC). The housing stock in New York is relatively old. About 33.7% of all units in the state were built before or during 1939; 49.7% were built between 1940
and 1979. In NYC, 83% of all housing units were built before 1960; in Buffalo, 73% of all units were built before 1939.</p><p>Statewide in 2004, 42.3% of all units were single-family, detached homes. In NYC, however, only 9% were single, detached units; 46.9% of the city's housing units are located in buildings of 20 units or more. The average household had 2.63 members. Housing differences in New York City offer far greater contrasts than units per structure: the posh apartment houses of Manhattan and the hovels of the South Bronx both count as multi-unit dwellings. In 2004, New York State had the second-lowest percentage of owner-occupied housing in the nation, at 55.6% (only the District of Columbia was lower). In 2004, it was estimated that 140,133 units in NYC lacked telephone service, 19,137 lacked complete plumbing facilities, and 20,630 lacked complete kitchen facilities. Statewide, about 247,421 units lacked telephone service, 32,130 lacked complete plumbing facilities, and 211,862 lacked complete kitchen facilities. Characteristic of housing in New York is a system of rent controls that began in 1943.</p><p>The tight housing market<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>which may have contributed to the exodus of New Yorkers from the state<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>was not helped by the slump in housing construction from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. In New York City, more units were demolished than built every year from 1974 to 1981. The drop in construction of multi-unit dwellings was even more noticeable: from 64,959 units in 1972 to 11,740 units in 1982. In 1993, only 7,723 multi-unit dwellings were authorized. The overall decline in construction was coupled with a drastic drop in new public housing. In 1972, permits were issued for 111,282 units valued at $2.1 billion. By 1975, however, only 32,623 units worth $756 million were authorized; in 1982 there were only 25,280 units worth $1.1 billion, and in 1996, 34,895 units valued at $3.1 billion were authorized. In 1998, numbers were on the rebound with 38,400 new privately owned housing units.</p><p>In 2004, 53,500 new privately owned housing units were authorized for construction. The median home value for the state was $220,981. The median home value in NYC was $373,176. The median monthly cost for mortgage owners statewide was $1,525; renters paid a median of $796 per month. In NYC, the median monthly cost for mortgage owners was $1,920; renters paid a median of $856 per month.</p><p>Direct state aid for housing is limited. Governmental and quasi-independent agencies dealing with housing include the following: the Division of Housing and Community Renewal of the Executive Department, which makes loans and grants to municipalities for slum clearance and construction of low-income housing, supervises the operation of more than 400 housing developments, and administers rent-control and rent-stabilization laws; the New York State Housing Finance Agency, which is empowered to issue notes and bonds for various construction projects, not limited to housing; the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which may purchase existing mortgage loans from banks in order to make funds available for the banks to make new mortgage loans, and which also offers mortgage insurance; and the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC), a multibillion dollar agency designed to raise capital for all types of construction, including low-income housing. In 2006, the state received over $48.5 million in community development block grants (CDBG) from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). New York City received $185.5 million in CDBGs and Buffalo received $16.5 million.</p><h2>EDUCATION</h2><p>The Board of Regents and the State Education Department govern education from pre-kindergarten to graduate school. They are constitutionally responsible for setting educational policy, standards, and rules and legally required to ensure that the entities they oversee carry them out. The board and department also provide vocational and educational services to people with disabilities.</p><p>In 2004, 85.4% of New Yorkers age 25 and older were high school graduates. Some 30.6% had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher.</p><p>The total enrollment for fall 2002 in New York's public schools stood at 2,888,000. Of these, 2,017,000 attended schools from kindergarten through grade eight, and 871,000 attended high school. Approximately 53.9% of the students were white, 19.7% were black, 19.4% were Hispanic, 6.6% were Asian/Pacific Islander, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaskan Native. Total enrollment was estimated at 2,872,000 in fall 2003 and expected to be 2,715,000 by fall 2014, a decline of 6% during the period 2002<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>14. Expenditures for public education in 2003/04 were estimated at $42.5 billion or $12,930 per student, the second-highest among the 50 states. In fall 2003 there were 458,079 students enrolled in 1,959 private schools. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has tested <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/public-school">public school</a> students nationwide. The resulting report, <i>The Nation's Report Card</i>, stated that in 2005 eighth graders in New York scored 280 out of 500 in mathematics compared with the national average of 278.</p><p>As of fall 2002, there were 1,107,270 students enrolled in institutions of higher education; minority students comprised 32.4% of total postsecondary enrollment. In 2005 New York had 309 degree-granting institutions including, 45 public four-year schools, 35 public two-year schools, and 163 nonprofit, private four-year schools.</p><p>There are two massive public university systems: the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/state-university-new-york">State University of New York</a> (SUNY) and the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/city-university-new-york">City University of New York</a> (CUNY). Established in 1948, SUNY is one of the largest university systems in the country and encompasses university colleges of arts and sciences, specialized colleges, agricultural and technical colleges, statutory colleges (allied with private universities), health sciences centers, and locally sponsored community colleges. University centers include Buffalo, Albany, and Binghamton. The <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/city-university-new-york">City University of New York</a> was created in 1961, although many of its component institutions (including 12 four-year institutions) were founded much earlier. Under an open-enrollment policy adopted in 1970, every New York City resident with a high school diploma is guaranteed the chance to earn a college degree within the CUNY system (which CUNY campus the student attends is determined by grade point average).</p><p>The oldest private university in the state is <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/columbia-university">Columbia University</a>, founded in New York City as Kings College in 1754. Also part of Columbia are Barnard College (all women) and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/columbia-university">Columbia University</a> Teachers College. Other major private institutions are <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/cornell-university">Cornell University</a> in Ithaca (1865); Fordham University in Manhattan and the Bronx (1841); New York University in Manhattan (1831); Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy (1824); St. John's University in Queens (1870); Syracuse University (1870); and the
University of Rochester (1850). Among the state's many smaller but highly distinguished institutions are Hamilton College, the Juilliard School, the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/new-school-social-research">New School for Social Research</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/rockefeller-university">Rockefeller University</a>, Sarah Lawrence College, Vassar College, and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/yeshiva-university">Yeshiva University</a>.</p><p>Unique features of education in New York are the "Regents exams," uniform subject examinations administered to all high school students, and the Regents Scholarships Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), a higher-education aid program. The state passed a "truth in testing" law in 1979, giving students the right to see their graded college and graduate school entrance examinations, as well as information on how the test results were validated.</p><h2>ARTS</h2><p>New York City is the cultural capital of the state, and leads the nation in both the creative and the performing arts. The state's foremost arts center is <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/theater/lincoln-center-performing-arts">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a>, in Manhattan. Facilities at Lincoln Center include Avery Fisher Hall (which opened as Philharmonic Hall in 1962), the home of the New York Philharmonic; the Metropolitan Opera House (1966), where the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/music-history/metropolitan-opera-company">Metropolitan Opera Company</a> performs; and the New York State Theater, which presents both the New York City Opera and the New York City Ballet. Also at Lincoln Center are the Julliard School and the Library and Museum of the Performing Arts. The best-known arts center outside New York City is the Saratoga Performing Arts Center at <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/saratoga-springs">Saratoga Springs</a>. During the summer, the Saratoga Center presents performances by the New York City Ballet and the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/music-history/philadelphia-orchestra">Philadelphia Orchestra</a>. Artpark, a state park at Lewiston, has a 2,324-seat theater for operas and musicals, and offers art exhibits during the summer.</p><p>The New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) consists of 20 governor-appointed members. In 2005, the NYSCA and other New York arts organizations received 440 grants totaling over $16,204,450 from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Council on the Arts also receives funding from the state as well as contributions from private sources. The New York State Council on the Arts contributed to the Arts Connection of New York City<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>a program dedicated to providing the New York City public schools with interactive programming associated with the various arts<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>and to the National Book Foundation<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>centered in New York city and created to promote literacy as well as the appreciation of great American writing.</p><p>The New York Council for the Humanities was established in 1975; as of 2006 the state's Council for the Humanities had provided programs to over 4,000 institutions reaching over 250,000 New Yorkers annually. In 2005, the National Endowment for the Humanities contributed $13,421,970 to 124 state programs.</p><p>The city's most famous artists' district is <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/greenwich-village">Greenwich Village</a>, which still holds an annual outdoor art fair. In 2005, the 57th <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/greenwich-village">Greenwich Village</a> Art Fair featured over 100 artists, working in numerous different mediums. After the 1950s many artists moved to SoHo (Manhattan on the West Side between Canal and Houston Streets), NoHo (immediately north of Houston Street), the East Village, and Tribeca (between Canal Street and the World Trade Center). By the early 1980s, artists seeking space at reasonable prices were moving to Long Island City in Queens, to areas of Brooklyn, or out of the city entirely, to places such as Hoboken and Paterson in New Jersey. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, abstract painters<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>including <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/jackson-pollock">Jackson Pollock</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/mark-rothko">Mark Rothko</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/willem-de-kooning">Willem de Kooning</a><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>helped make the city a center of the avant garde.</p><p>At the same time, poets such as Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery sought verbal analogues to developments in the visual arts, and an urbane, improvisatory literature was created. New York has enjoyed a vigorous poetic tradition throughout its history, most notably with the works of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/walt-whitman">Walt Whitman</a> (who served as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle from 1846 to 1848) and through <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/hart-crane">Hart Crane</a>'s mythic vision of the city in his long poem, <i>The Bridge</i>. The emergence of New York as the center of the US publishing and communications industries fostered the growth of a literary marketplace, attracting writers from across the country and the world. Early New York novelists included <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/washington-irving">Washington Irving</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/edgar-allan-poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/herman-melville">Herman Melville</a>; among the many who made their home in the city in the 20th century were Thomas Wolfe and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/norman-mailer">Norman Mailer</a>. The simultaneous growth of the Broadway stage made New York City a vital forum for playwriting, songwriting, and theatrical production. New York City is also a major link in the US songwriting, music publishing, and recording industries.</p><p>There are more than 35 Broadway theaters<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>large theaters in midtown Manhattan presenting full-scale, sometimes lavish productions with top-rank performers. "Off Broadway" productions are often of high professional quality, though typically in smaller theaters, outside the midtown district, often with smaller casts and less costly settings. "Off-Off Broadway" productions range from small experimental theaters on the fringes of the city to performances in nightclubs and cabarets. The New York metropolitan area has hundreds of motion picture theaters<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>more than 65 in Manhattan alone, not counting special series at the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/museum-modern-art">Museum of Modern Art</a> and other cultural institutions. In the 1970s, New York City made a determined and successful effort to attract motion picture production companies.</p><p>New York's leading symphony orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, is the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States with a history that dates back to the founding of the Philharmonic Society of New York in 1842. Among the principal conductors of the orchestra have been <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/gustav-mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/josef-willem">Josef Willem Mengelberg</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/wilhelm-furtwangler">Wilhelm Furtwangler</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/arturo-toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/leonard-bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/pierre-boulez">Pierre Boulez</a>, and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/zubin-mehta">Zubin Mehta</a>. As of its 2004/05 season the orchestra had performed in over 416 cities and 57 countries. Leading US and foreign orchestras and soloists appear at both Avery Fisher Hall and Carnegie Hall, built in 1892 and famed for its acoustics. Important orchestras outside New York City include the Buffalo Philharmonic, which performs at Kleinhans Music Hall, the Rochester Philharmonic, and the Eastman Philharmonic, the orchestra of the Eastman School of Music (University of Rochester).</p><p>New York City is one of the world centers of ballet. Of special renown is the New York City Ballet; the company consisted of approximately 90 dancers<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>the largest in America. The New York City Ballet's principal choreographer until his death in 1983 was <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/dance-biographies/george-balanchine">George Balanchine</a>. Many other ballet companies, including the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/dance/american-ballet-theatre">American Ballet Theatre</a> and the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/american-art-biographies/alvin-ailey">Alvin Ailey</a> American Dance Theater, make regular appearances in New York. Rochester, Syracuse, Cooperstown, Chautauqua, and Binghamton have opera companies, and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-george">Lake George</a> has an opera festival. The Lake George Opera marked its 45th summer season in 2006. The North
Fork Theatre at Westbury presents wide-ranging musical and co-medic programs.</p><h2>LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS</h2><p>In 2001, the state of New York had 750 public library systems, with a total of 1,089 libraries, of which 340 were branches. In that same year, the state's public library system had 78,546,000 volumes of books and serial publications on its shelves, and a total circulation of 126,796,000. The system also had 4,371,000 audio and 2,115,000 video items, 665,000 electronic format items (CD-ROMs, magnetic tapes, and disks), and 10 bookmobiles. The state also had three of the world's largest libraries, and New York City has several of the world's most famous museums. In fiscal year 2001, operating income for the public library system totaled $902,746,000 and included $3,981,000 from the federal government, $51,055,000 from the state government, and the rest from local sources.</p><p>The leading public library systems and their operating statistics as of 1999 were the New York Public Library, 17,762,034 volumes in 127 branches; Brooklyn Public Library, 6,800,000 volumes and 10,077,559 circulation; Queens Borough Public Library, 8,668,948 volumes and 14,829,837 circulation; and Buffalo and Erie County system, 5,240,965 volumes and 8,734,854 circulation.</p><p>Chartered in 1895, the New York Public Library (NYPL) is the most complete municipal library system in the world. The library's main building, at 5th Avenue and 42d St., is one of the city's best-known landmarks; serving the needs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The NYPL is a repository for every book published in the United States. The NYPL also operates the Library and Museum of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center; the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture; and the Science, Industry, and Business Library that opened in May 1996.</p><p>Two private university libraries<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>at Columbia University (7,018,408 volumes in 1999) and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/cornell-university">Cornell University</a> (6,617,242)-rank among the world's major libraries. Other major university libraries in the state, with their 1999 book holdings, are Syracuse University, 2,650,995; New York University, 2,987,062; the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/state-university-new-york">State University of New York</a> at Buffalo, 2,534,500; and the University of Rochester, 2,446,729.</p><p>There are about 671 museums in New York State; about 150 are major museums, of which perhaps 80% are in New York City. In addition, some 579 sites of historic importance are maintained by local historical societies. Major art museums in New York City include the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/metropolitan-museum-art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, with more than one million art objects and paintings from virtually every period and culture; the Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum devoted entirely to medieval art and architecture; the Frick collection; the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/whitney-museum-american-art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>; the Brooklyn Museum; and two large modern collections, the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/museum-modern-art">Museum of Modern Art</a> and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (the latter designed by <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/frank-lloyd-wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> in a distinctive spiral pattern). The Jewish Museum, the Museum of the American Indian, and the museum and reference library of the Hispanic Society of America specialize in cultural history.</p><p>The sciences are represented by the American Museum of Natural History, famed for its dioramas of humans and animals in natural settings and for its massive dinosaur skeletons; the Hayden Planetarium; the New York Botanical Garden and New York Zoological Society Park (Bronx Zoo), both in the Bronx. Also of interest are the Museum of the City of New York, the Museum of the New-York Historical Society, the South Street Seaport Museum, and the New York Aquarium.</p><p>The New York State Museum in Albany contains natural history collections and historical artifacts. Buffalo has several museums of note, including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery (for contemporary art), the Buffalo Museum of Science, and the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society museum.</p><p>Among the state's many other fine museums, the Everson Museum of Art (Syracuse), the Rochester Museum and Science Center, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum (Cooperstown), and the Corning Museum of Glass deserve special mention. Buffalo, New Rochelle, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica have zoos.</p><h2>COMMUNICATIONS</h2><p>New York City is the hub of the entire US communications network. Postal service was established in New York State in 1692; at the same time, the first General Letter Office was begun in New York City. By the mid-19th century, postal receipts in the state accounted for more than 20% of the US total. "Fast mail" service by train started in the 1870s, with the main routes leading from New York City to either Chicago or St. Louis via Indianapolis and Cincinnati. Mail was carried by air experimentally from Garden City to Mineola, Long Island, in 1911; the first regular airmail service in the United States started in 1917, between New York City and Washington, DC, via Philadelphia.</p><p>Telephone service in New York is provided primarily by the New York Telephone Co., but also by more than 40 smaller companies throughout the state. As of 2004, 94.5% of New York's occupied housing units had telephones. Additionally, by June of that same year there were 9,939,759 mobile wireless telephone subscribers. In 2003, 60.0% of New York households had a computer and 53.3% had Internet access. By June 2005, there were 3,188,033 high-speed lines in New York, 2,833,478 residential and 354,555 for business.</p><p>Until 31 December 1983, New York Telephone was part of the Bell System, whose parent organization was the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&amp;T). Effective 1 January 1984, as the result of a US Justice Department antitrust suit, AT&amp;T divested itself of 22 Bell operating companies, which regrouped into seven independent regional telephone companies to provide local telephone service in the United States. One of these companies, NYNEX, is the parent company of New York Telephone. AT&amp;T, which continued to supply long-distance telephone services to New Yorkers (along with competitive carriers such as MCI, ITT, and GTE), is headquartered in New York City.</p><p>Domestic telegraph service is provided by the Western Union Telegraph Co., ITT World Communications, RCA Global Communications, and Western Union International. All four companies have their headquarters in New York City. New York State had 58 major AM stations and 181 major FM stations operating in 2005. New York City operates its own radio stations, WNYC-AM and FM, devoted largely to classical music and educational programming. There were 46 major television stations in the state in 2005. The city is the headquarters for most of the major US television networks, including the American Broadcasting Co. (now part of <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/film-and-television-biographies/walt-disney">Walt Disney</a> Corp.), Columbia Broadcasting System (owned by the Westinghouse Corp.), National Broadcasting Co.
(owned by General Electric), Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W), Metromedia, and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The metropolitan area's PBS affiliate, WNET (licensed in Newark, N.J.), is a leading producer of programs for the PBS network. As of 1999, the New York metropolitan area had 6,874,990 television households, 74% of which received cable. The Buffalo region had 621,460 television homes, with a 77% penetration rate.</p><p>A total of 589,963 Internet domain names were registered in the state in the year 2000; the second highest number of all states.</p><h2>PRESS</h2><p>A pioneer in the establishment of <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts-58">freedom of the press</a>, New York is the leader of the US newspaper, magazine, and book-publishing industries. The first major test of press freedom in the colonies came in 1734, when a German-American printer, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-peter-zenger">John Peter Zenger</a>, was arrested on charges of sedition and libel. In his newspaper, the <i>New-York Weekly Journal</i>, Zenger had published articles criticizing the colonial governor of New York. Zenger's lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, argued that because the charges in the article were true, they could not be libelous. The jury's acceptance of this argument freed Zenger and established the right of the press to criticize those in power. Two late decisions involving a New York newspaper also struck blows for press freedom. In <i>New York Times v. Sullivan</i> (1964), the US Supreme Court ruled that a public official could not win a libel suit against a newspaper unless he could show that its statements about him were not only false but also malicious or in reckless disregard of the truth. In 1971, the <i>New York Times</i> was again involved in a landmark case when the federal government tried<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>and failed<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>to prevent the newspaper from publishing <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/pentagon">the Pentagon</a> Papers, a collection of secret documents concerning the war in Vietnam.</p><p>In 2005, New York had 37 morning newspapers, 23 evening papers, and 38 Sunday editions.</p><p>The following table shows leading papers in New York, with their average daily and Sunday circulations in 2005:</p><table border="0"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="left"><b>AREA</b></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><b>NAME</b></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><b>DAILY</b></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><b>SUNDAY</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="left">Albany</th><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>Times-Union</i> (m,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">100,628</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">146,464</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="left">Buffalo</th><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>News</i> (all day,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">196,429</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">282,618</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="left">Long Island</th><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>Newsday</i> (m,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">481,816</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">574,081</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="left">New York City</th><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>Daily News</i> (m,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">715,052</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">786,952</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>Post</i> (m,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">481,860</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">455,511</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>Times</i> (m,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">1,121,057</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">1,680,583</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i><a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing/journalism-and-publishing/wall-street-journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> (m)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">1,780,605</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="left">Rochester</th><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>Democrat and Chronicle</i> (m,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">166,727</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">224,408</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="left">Syracuse</th><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right"><i>Post-Standard</i> (m,S)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">118,926</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" align="right">175,020</td></tr></tbody></table><p>All of New York City's major newspapers have claims to fame. The <i>Times</i> is the nation's "newspaper of record," excelling in the publication of speeches, press conferences, and government reports. It is widely circulated to US libraries and is often cited in research. In 2005, the <i>Times</i> Sunday edition was the number one Sunday newspaper in the nation, based on circulation figures. The <i>New York Post</i>, founded in 1801, is the oldest US newspaper published continuously without change of name. The <i><a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/journalism-and-publishing/journalism-and-publishing/wall-street-journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i>, published Monday through Friday, is a truly national paper, presenting mostly business news in four regional editions. In 2005, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>Times</i>, the New York <i>Daily News</i>, the Long Island <i>Newsday</i>, and the Post were among the top thirteen largest daily newspapers in the nation. Many historic New York papers first merged and then<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>bearing compound names like the <i>Herald-Tribune, Journal-American</i>, and <i>World-Telegram &amp; Sun Newspaper</i> <span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>died in the 1950s and 1960s. In 2001, the Syracuse <i>Herald-American</i> and <i>Herald-Journal</i> merged to form the <i>Post-Standard</i></p><p>There are two Spanish dailies published in New York City: <i>El Diario La Prensa</i>, with a circulation of 50,019 daily and 34,636 Sundays; and <i>Hoy</i>, with a circulation of 49,681 daily and 25,465 Sundays.</p><p>The leading newspaper chain is the Gannett Co., Inc. (headquarters in Virginia). Other groups include Ogden Newspapers, Inc.(<a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/west-virginia">West Virginia</a>), Hearst Newspapers (New York), and Johnson Newspaper Corp. (New York). All the major news agencies have offices in New York City, and the Associated Press has its head-quarters there.</p><p>In 2005, there were 354 weekly publications in New York. Of these there are 208 paid weeklies, 53 free weeklies, and 93 combined weeklies. The total circulation of paid weeklies (1,635,143) and free weeklies (2,420,539) is 4,055,682. Two of New York City's paid weeklies, <i>People's Weekly World</i> and <i>Observer</i> ranked first and sixth, respectively, in the United States based on circulations of 67,700 and 52,000. Based on circulation in the United States in 2005, among free weeklies the Suffolk County <i>Life Newspapers</i> ranked second in the United States with a circulation of 548,657. The Nassau County <i>This Week/Pennysaver</i> (circulation 993,913) ranked seventh in the United States among shopping publications.</p><p>Many leading US magazines are published in New York City, including the newsmagazines <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>, business journals like <i>Fortune, Forbes</i>, and <i>Business Week</i>, and hundreds of consumer and trade publications. <i>Reader's Digest</i> is published in Pleasantville. Two weeklies closely identified with New York are of more than local interest. While the <i>New Yorker</i> carries up-to-date listings of cultural events and exhibitions in New York City, the excellence of its journalism, criticism, fiction, and cartoons has long made it a literary standard-bearer for the entire nation. <i>New York</i> magazine influenced the writing style and graphic design of the 1960s and set the pattern for a new wave of state and local magazines that avoided boosterism in favor of independent reporting and commentary. Another weekly, the <i>Village Voice</i> (actually a tabloid newspaper), became the prototype for a host of alternative or "underground" journals during the 1960s.</p><p>New York City is also the center of the nation's book-publishing industry. New York publishers include McGraw-Hill, Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Random House; many book publishers are subsidiaries of other companies.</p><h2>ORGANIZATIONS</h2><p>In 2006, there were over 25,673 nonprofit organizations registered within the state, of which about 19,427 were registered as charitable, educational, or religious organizations.</p><p>The <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/united-nations/united-nations">United Nations</a> is the best-known organization to have its headquarters in New York. The UN Secretariat, completed in 1951, remains one of the most familiar landmarks of New York City. Hundreds of US nonprofit organizations also have their national headquarters in New York City. General and service organizations operating out of New York City include the American Field Service, Boys Clubs of America, Girls Clubs of America, Girl
Scouts of the USA, Young Women's Christian Associations of the USA (YWCA), and Associated YM-YWHAs of Greater New York (the Jewish equivalent of the YMCA and YWCA).</p><p>Among the cultural and educational groups of national interest are the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Authors League of America, Children's Book Council, Modern Language Association of America, and PEN American Center.

In 2001, there were 35.2 million visitors to New York City, including 5.7 million international visitors. The projection for 2006 was 43.3 millions visitors to New York City. New York City alone brings in $39 billion in revenue. New York City also supported 291,977 jobs in tourism in 2004. A typical visit to New York City might include a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty; a three-hour boat ride around Manhattan; the Empire State Building, the United Nations, Rockefeller Center, and the New York Stock Exchange; walking tours of the Bronx Zoo, Chinatown, and the theater district; and a sampling of the city's many museums, restaurants, shops, and shows.</p><p>Second to New York City as a magnet for tourists comes Long Island, with its beaches, racetracks, and other recreational facilities. Attractions of the Hudson Valley include the US Military Academy (West Point), the Franklin D. Roosevelt home at <a class="interlinked" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-political-geography/hyde-park">Hyde Park</a>, Bear Mountain State Park, and several wineries. North of Hudson Valley is Albany, with its massive government center, Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Plaza, often called the Albany Mall; <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/saratoga-springs">Saratoga Springs</a>, home of an arts center, racetrack, and spa; and the Adirondack region, with its forest preserve, summer and winter resorts, and abundant hunting and fishing. Northwest of the Adirondacks, in the St. Lawrence River, are the Thousand Islands<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span>actually some 1,800 small islands extending over some 50 mi (80 km) and popular among freshwater fishermen and sum-mer vacationers.</p><p>Scenic sites in central New York include the summer resorts and ski areas of the Catskills and the scenic marvels and wineries of the Finger Lakes region, including Taughannock Falls in Trumansburg, the highest waterfall east of the Rockies. Further west lie Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls alone attracts over 12 million visitors annually. Charter boat fishing is available on Lake Ontario. Chautauqua Lake and Allegany State Park, the state's largest, lie south of Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Elmont is the home of the Belmont race track, the third leg in the Triple Crown of thoroughbred <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/sports/sports/horse-racing">horse racing</a>. Motorsports fans can visit the Adirondacks International Speedway.</p><h2>SPORTS</h2><p>New York has eleven major league professional sports teams: the New York Yankees and the New York Mets of Major League Baseball; the New York Giants, the New York Jets (although the Giants' and Jets' stadiums are located in New Jersey), and the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League; the New York Knickerbockers (usually called the Knicks) of the National Basketball Association; the New York Islanders, the New York Rangers, and the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League; the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association, and Red Bull New York of Major League Soccer.</p><p>The Yankees have a record of excellence spanning most of the twentieth century. They won the American League Pennant 39 times and the World Series 26 times, most recently in 2000, when they defeated the New York Mets in five games. The series was coined the "Subway Series" because both teams were from New York City. Other championship streaks include the American League Pennant in 1927 and 1928; 1936<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>39; 1941<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>43; 1949<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>53; 1955<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>58; 1960<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>64; 1998<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>2001. In the 28 years between 1936 and
1964, the Yankees competed in 23 World Series, winning 16. The Mets have played in four World Series, winning in 1969 and 1986. The Giants won Super Bowls in 1987 and 1991, and the Jets did so in 1969 in a memorable upset victory over the Baltimore Colts. The Buffalo Bills won the American Football Conference Championship in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, losing the Super Bowl each time. The Knicks won the NBA championship in 1970 and 1973, and lost in the NBA finals in 1951, 1952, 1953, 1972, 1994, and 1999. The Islanders won the Stanley Cup in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983. The Rangers won it in 1928, 1933, 1940, and 1994.</p><p>Three New York teams, the Nets, Giants, and Jets, moved to New Jersey during the 1970s and 1980s. The Giants and Jets remained, in name, New York teams (unlike the Nets, who are now the New Jersey Nets), although the move remains controversial. In 1987, when the Giants won the Super Bowl, then mayor of New York Ed Koch refused them the tickertape parade through the city traditionally given in honor of championship teams on the grounds that, their name notwithstanding, they are a New Jersey team.</p><p>The state also has 13 minor league baseball teams and six minor league hockey teams.</p><p>Horse racing is important to New York State, both as a sports attraction and because of the tax revenues that betting generates. The main thoroughbred racetracks are Aqueduct in Queens, Belmont in Nassau County, and the Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs. Belmont is the home of the Belmont Stakes, one of the three jewels in the Triple Crown of US racing. Saratoga Springs also has a longer harness-racing season at its Saratoga Equine Sports Center facility. Thoroughbred racing is also offered at the Finger Lakes track in Canandaigua. The top track for harness racing is Monticello Raceway (in the Catskills).</p><p>The New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation (OTB), which began operations in April 1971, takes bets on races at the state's major tracks, as well as on some out-of-state races. Off-track betting services operate on a smaller scale on Long Island and in upstate New York.</p><p>New York City hosts several major professional tennis tournaments every year, including the US Open in Flushing Meadows; the Last Minute Travel.com Masters (men) in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/central-park">Central Park</a>, and the Chase Championships of the WTA Tour (women) at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>Among other professional sports facilities, the Watkins Glen International automobile racetrack was, until 1980, the site of a Grand Prix race every October. It now hosts a NASCAR Nextel Cup race in August. Lake Placid, an important winter-sports region, hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics, and continues to host amateur winter sports competitions, such as bobsled racing and ski jumping. New York City's Madison Square Garden is a leading venue for professional boxing and hosts many other sporting events.</p><p>In collegiate sports, basketball is perhaps most popular. Historically, the City College of New York produced many nationally ranked teams including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) champions of 1950; in that year, they also won the National Invitational Basketball Tournament (NIT). St. John's and Syracuse have produced nationally prominent teams, including the 1989 St. John's team that won the NIT. The Syracuse Orangemen won the 2003 National Championship.</p><p>The US Military Academy at West Point (Army) won college football national championships in 1944 and 1945, and, as of 1997, ranked 12th all-time among Division I-A teams with more than 600 victories.</p><p>Hockey and lacrosse are popular sports at the collegiate level and have been well represented by New York <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/colleges-and-universities">colleges and universities</a>. Both the Syracuse Orangemen and Cornell Big Red have captured multiple national championships on the Division-I level. Cornell has been equally successful on the ice, advancing to the Frozen Four on a number of occasions (most recently in 2003). The Big Red captured the national championship in both 1967 and 1970.</p><p>In 1978, New York became the first state to sponsor a statewide amateur athletic event, the Empire State Games. More than 50,000 athletes now compete for a place in the finals, held each summer; the Winter Games, held each February in Lake Placid, host more than 1,000.</p><p>The New York City marathon, which is held in late October or early November, has become one of the largest, most prestigious marathons in the world.</p><p>Other annual sporting events include the Adirondack Hot Air Balloon Festival in Glens Falls in September and the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City in February. The Baseball Hall of Fame is located in Cooperstown.</p><h2>FAMOUS NEW YORKERS</h2><p>New York State has been the home of five US presidents, eight US vice presidents (three of whom also became president), many statesmen of national and international repute, and a large corps of writers and entertainers.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/martin-van-buren">Martin Van Buren</a> (1782<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>1862), the eighth US president, became governor of New York in 1828. He was elected to the vice presidency as a Democrat under <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/andrew-jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> in 1832, and succeeded Jackson in the election of 1836. An unpopular president, Van Buren ran for reelection in 1840 but was defeated, losing even his home state. The 13th US president, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/millard-fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> (1800<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span>74), was elected vice president under <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/zachary-taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> in 1848. He became president in 1850 when Taylor died.

A year after losing that election, FDR was crippled by poliomyelitis. He then made an amazing political comeback: he was elected governor of New York in 1928 and served until 1932, when US voters chose him as their 32d president. Reelected in 1936, 1940, and 1944, FDR is the only president ever to have served more than two full terms in office.

Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.</p><p> Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.

The total area of New York is 49,108 square miles (127,190 square kilometers), of which land takes up 47,377 square miles (122,707 square kilometers) and the remaining 1,731 square miles (4,483 square kilometers) consists of inland water. New York’s width is about 320 miles (515 kilometers) from east to west, not including <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/long-island">Long Island</a>, which extends an additional 118 miles (190 kilometers) southwest–northeast. The state’s maximum north–south extension is about 310 miles (499 kilometers).Two large islands lie off the state’s southeast corner: <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/long-island">Long Island</a> and Staten Island (a borough of New York City). Including these two islands, the total boundary length of New York State is 1,430 miles (2,301 kilometers). Long Island, with an area of 1,396 sq mi (3,616 sq km), is the largest island belonging to one of the 48 contiguous states.</p><h2><a id="B">2 Topography</a></h2><p>Two upland regions, the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/adirondack-mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a> and the Appalachian Highlands, dominate the topography of New York State. The Adirondacks cover most of the northeast and occupy about one-fourth of the state’s total area. The Appalachian Highlands, including the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/catskill-mountains">Catskill Mountains</a> and Kittatinny Mountain Ridge (or Shawangunk Mountains), extend across the southern half of the state, from the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/hudson-river">Hudson River</a> Valley to the basin of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-erie">Lake Erie</a>. Between these two upland regions, and also along the state’s northern and eastern borders, lies a network of lowlands, including the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/great-lakes">Great Lakes</a> Plain; the Hudson, Mohawk, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, and St. Lawrence valleys; and the coastal areas of New York City and Long Island.</p><p>The state’s highest peaks are found in the Adirondacks: Mount March, 5,344 feet (1,629 meters), and Algonquin Peak, 5,114 feet (1,559 meters). Nestled among the Adirondacks are many scenic lakes, including Lake Placid, Saranac Lake, and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-george">Lake George</a>.

New York contains some 8,000 inland lakes. The largest lake wholly within the state is Oneida, with an area of 80 square miles (207 square kilometers). The 11 Finger Lakes are long and narrow, fanning southward from a line that runs roughly from Syracuse westward to Geneseo.</p><p>New York’s longest river is the Hudson, extending for a distance of 306 miles (492 kilometers). The Mohawk River flows into the Hudson north of Albany. The major rivers of central and western New York, the Black, Genesee, and Oswego, all flow into <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-ontario">Lake Ontario</a>. Rivers defining the state’s borders are the St. Lawrence in the north, the Poultney in the east, the Delaware in the southeast, and the Niagara in the west. Along the Niagara River, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/niagara-falls">Niagara Falls</a> forms New York’s most spectacular natural feature.

The three main climatic regions are the southeastern lowlands, which have the warmest temperatures and the longest season between frosts; the uplands of the Catskills and Adirondacks, where winters are cold and summers cool; and the snow belt along the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/great-lakes">Great Lakes</a> Plain, one of the snowiest areas of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/united-states">United States</a>.</p><p>In New York City, temperatures range from an average of 63°f (17°c) in the summer and an average of 47°f (8°c) in the winter. In Buffalo, the normal maximum temperature is 57°f (13°c) and the normal minimum is 40°f (4°c). The record low temperature for the state is -52°f (-47°c), recorded at Stillwater Reservoir in the Adirondacks on 9 February 1934 and at Old Forge on 18 February 1979. The record high is 108°f (42°c), registered at Troy on 22 July 1926.</p><p>Annual precipitation ranges from over 50 inches (127 centimeters) in the higher elevations to about 30 inches (76 centimeters) in the areas near <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-ontario">Lake Ontario</a> and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, and in the lower half of the Genesee River Valley. New York City has an annual mean snowfall of 28 inches (71 centimeters). Buffalo receives about 91 inches (231 centimeters) of snow per year and Syracuse receives about 114 inches (289 centimeters).Tornadoes are rare, but hurricanes and tropical storms sometimes cause heavy damage to Long Island.</p><h2><a id="D">4 Plants and Animals</a></h2><p>New York has about 150 species of trees. These include laurel magnolia, sweet gum, and hop trees near the Atlantic shore; oak, hickory, and chestnut in the Hudson and Mohawk valleys and the Great Lakes Plain; and birch, beech, and commercially valuable maple on the Appalachian Plateau and in the foothills of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/adirondack-mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a>.

Indian pipe, bunchberry, and goldthread flourish in the forests, while cattails grow along the Hudson and rushes cover the Finger Lakes shallows. In 2006, five plant species were listed as threatened or endangered, including the sand-plain gerardia, American hart’s-tongue fern, and Leedy’s roseroot.</p><p>Some 600 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles are found in New York, of which more than 450 species are common. Mammals found in abundance include woodchuck, squirrel, muskrat, and raccoon. The deer population has been estimated at as high as 500,000, making them pests and causing millions of dollars annually in crop damage. More than 260 bird species have been observed. The most common year-round residents are the crow, hawk, and several types of woodpecker. Summer visitors include the bluebird (the state bird).</p><p>Water snakes and grass snakes are common. There are 210 known species of fish; 130 species are found in the Hudson, 120 in the Lake Ontario watershed. Freshwater fish include species of perch, bass, and trout (the state fish). Of insect varieties, the <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/animals/zoology-invertebrates/gypsy-moth">gypsy moth</a> has been singled out as an enemy in periodic state-run pest-control programs.</p><p>In 2006, the US Fish and Wildlife Service listed 20 animal species as threatened or endangered, including the Indiana bat, Karner blue butterfly, piping plover, <a class="interlinked" href="/plants-and-animals/animals/vertebrate-zoology/bald-eagle">bald eagle</a>, shortnose sturgeon, three species of whale, and five species of turtle.</p><h2><a id="E">5 Environmental Protection</a></h2><p>All state environmental programs are run by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), established in 1970. The department oversees pollution control programs, monitors environmental quality, manages the forest preserves, and administers fish and wildlife laws.</p><p>The chief air quality problem areas are Buffalo, where levels of particles (especially from the use of coke in steelmaking) are high, and New York City, where little progress has been made in cutting <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/carbon-monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> emissions from motor vehicles. Despite air quality efforts, <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/environmental-studies/acid-rain">acid rain</a> has been blamed for killing fish and trees in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and other areas. Water problems include continued dumping of sewage and industrial wastes into New York Bay and Long Island Sound, sewage over-flows into the Lower Hudson, industrial dumping in the Hudson Valley, nuclear wastes in West Valley in Cattaraugus County, and contamination of fish in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/lake-erie">Lake Erie</a>. Toxic pollutants, such as organic chemicals and heavy metals, appear in surface and groundwater to an extent not yet fully assessed.</p><p>In 2003, New York had 485 hazardous waste sites listed in the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/environmental-protection">Environmental Protection Agency</a>’s database, 86 of which were on the National Priorities List in 2006.</p><p>A 1982 law requires a deposit on beer and soft drink containers sold in the state, to encourage the return and recycling of bottles and cans.</p><p>Wetlands covered 2.5 million acres of the state as of 2000. About one-half of the 160 species identified as endangered or threatened by the Department of Environmental Conservation are wetlands-dependent.</p><h2><a id="F">6 Population</a></h2><p>In 2006, New York ranked third in population in the United States with an estimated total of 19,306,183 residents. The population is projected to reach 19.5 million by 2015. In 2004, the state’s population density was 407.2 persons per square mile (157.2 persons per square kilometer). Also in 2004, the median age was 37.3 years. In 2005, about 13% of all residents were 65 years old or older while 24% were 18 or younger.</p><p>In 2005, New York City was the largest city in both the state and the country with an estimated total of 8,143,197 residents. Other leading cities, with their 2005 populations were Buffalo, 279,745; Rochester, 211,091; Yonkers, 196,425; and Syracuse, 141,683. Albany, the state capital, had an estimated population of 93,523 in 2005.</p><h2><a id="G">7 Ethnic Groups</a></h2><p>The ethnic diversity of the state is reflected in such Manhattan neighborhoods as Harlem, Chinatown, Little Italy, and “Spanish,” or East, Harlem, with its large Puerto Rican concentration. New immigrants still tend to form ethnic communities, often in the outer boroughs, such as Asians and South Americans in certain parts of Queens and Russian Jews in south Brooklyn. Outside New York City there are also important ethnic enclaves in the Buffalo metropolitan area, with its large populations of Polish and Italian origin.</p><p>As of the 2000 census, New York had the largest black American population among the 50 states and second-largest Asian population. The state also had the second-highest percentage of foreign-born residents.</p><p>Also in 2000, New York had 82,461 Native American residents, primarily from seven tribes: the Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora nations; the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe; and the Tonawanda Band of Senecas.</p><p>The black American population of New York State was 3,014,385 as of 2000, which was about 16% of the state’s population. The population of Hispanics and Latinos was 2,867,583 people, or about 16% of the state population. Of the Hispanics, about 1,050,293 were Puerto Ricans. Cubans, Dominicans, Colombians, Central Americans, and Mexicans were also present in growing numbers, including a large but undetermined number of illegal immigrants.</p><p>In 2000, the Asian population of the state was estimated at 1,044,976 people, including 424,774 Chinese, 251,724 Asian Indians, 119,846 Koreans, 81,681 Filipinos, 37,279 Japanese, and 23,818 Vietnamese. New York City has the second-largest Chinatown in the United States. Pacific Islanders numbered 8,818.</p><p>In 2000, there were 3,868,133 foreign-born New Yorkers, which was about 20.4% of the total state population. Among persons who reported at least one specific ancestry group, 2,122,620 were German, 2,737,146 were Italian, 2,454,469 were Irish, 1,140,036 were English, 986,141 were Polish, and 460,261 were Russian. A large numbers of European Jewish immigrants have chosen not to identify their country of origin.</p><p>As of 2006, estimates indicate the 15.3% of residents were black Americans, 16.2% were Hispanic or Latino, and 6.7% were Asian.</p><h2><a id="H">8 Languages</a></h2><p>Although the speech of metropolitan New York has its own characteristics, in the state as a whole the Northern dialect predominates. Regional variations distinguish the speech of such areas as the Hudson Valley, the eastern part of the state, and the Niagara peninsula. In the New York City area, many speakers pronounce <i>bird</i> almost as if it were /boyd/ and do not sound the /r/ after a vowel. New Yorkers stand <i>on line</i> (instead of <i>in line</i>) while waiting to buy a huge sandwich they call a <i>hero</i>, and may even pronounce <i>Long Island</i> with an inserted /g/ as /Long Giland/.</p><p>From the high proportion of New York Yiddish speakers have come such terms as <i>schlock, schmaltz</i>, and <i>chutzpah</i>. Place names such as Manhattan, Adirondack, and Chautauqua were borrowed from the Iroquois.</p><p>Serious communication problems have arisen in New York City, especially in the schools, because of the major influx since <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-ii">World War II</a> of Spanish speakers from the Caribbean region and, more recently, of Asians. These are in addition to the ever present large numbers of speakers of other languages. As a result, schools in some areas have emphasized teaching English as a second language.</p><p>According to the 2000 census, 72% of all New Yorkers five years of age or older spoke only English at home. Other principal languages and the number of speakers were Spanish, 2,416,126; Chinese, 374,627; Italian, 294,271; Russian, 218,765; French, 180,809; French Creole,</p><p>114,747; Yiddish, 113,514; Polish, 111,730; and Korean, 102,105.</p><h2><a id="I">9 Religions</a></h2><p>Before the 1800s, Protestant sects dominated the religious life of New York. The first Jews were permitted to settle in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> in 1654. Full religious freedom was not permitted until the constitution of 1777. There was no Roman Catholic church in upstate New York until 1797. Many Protestant churches took part enthusiastically in the abolitionist movement, and the blacks who fled northward out of slavery formed their own Protestant churches and church organizations.</p><p>As of 2004, New York had 7,761,801 Roman Catholics. In 2000, there were 1,653,870 adherents of Jewish congregations. Leading Protestant denominations included United Methodists, with 403,362 adherents; Episcopalians, 201,797; Presbyterians (USA), 162,227; and Evangelical Lutherans, 169,329. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/church">The Church</a> of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported a statewide membership of about 69,682 in 2006. There were about 223,968 members of Muslim congregations in 2000. That year, there were also about 121 Buddhist congregations and 83 Hindu congregations statewide. A wide variety of religious-nationalist sects and cults exist, including the World Community of Islam in the West (also called the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/islam/islam/nation-islam">Nation of Islam</a> or <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/islam/islam/black-muslims">Black Muslims</a>), the Hare Krishna group, and the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion-6">Unification Church</a> of the Reverend <a class="interlinked" href="/people/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-biographies/sun-myung-moon">Sun Myung Moon</a>. About 39.6% of the population was not counted as members of any religious organization.</p><h2><a id="J">10 Transportation</a></h2><p>In 2003, New York had 4,879 miles (7,855 kilometer) of track. In the same year, there were 2 Class I lines, 2 Canadian lines, 4 regional, 20 local, and 7 switching and terminal railroads. Today, much of New York’s rail network is operated by Conrail, a federally assisted private corporation that also provides commuter service up the Hudson and to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> and Connecticut. Conrail is now owned by CSX Transportation and Norfolk &amp; Southern Railroad. Amtrak owns and operates lines along the eastern corridor from Boston through New York City to Washington, DC, stopping at 25 stations. New York City’s Penn Station is the busiest station in the entire Amtrak system.</p><p>The Long Island Railroad, an important commuter carrier, is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which also operates the New York City subways. Construction of the New York City subway system began in 1900 and service started on 27 October 1904. The route network is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) long, of which 137 miles (220 kilometers) are underground.</p><p>The only other mass transit rail line in the state is Buffalo’s 6.4 miles (10.3 kilometers) of light rail system, of which 5.2 miles (8.4 kilometers) are underground. In 1984, regular trolley service resumed in Buffalo for the first time since 1950, running through the downtown shipping district. Cities served by municipal, county, or metropolitan area bus systems are Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Elmira, and Syracuse.</p><p>In 2004, about 11 million motor vehicles were registered in New York State, including 8.4 million automobiles, 25,000 buses, and 2.3 million trucks. In addition 169,000 motorcycles were registered. As of 2004, the state had 113,341 miles (182,479 kilometers) of public roads and highways. The major toll road, and the nation’s longest toll superhighway, is the Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, operated by the New York State Thruway Authority, which extends 559 miles (900 kilometers) from just outside New York City to Buffalo and the Pennsylvania border in southwestern New York. Toll free expressways include the Adirondack Northway (I-87) and the North–South Expressway (I-81).</p><p>A number of famous bridges and tunnels connect the five boroughs of New York City with each other and with <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a>. The Verrazano–Narrows Bridge, opened to traffic in 1964, spans New York Harbor between Brooklyn and Staten Island. Equally famous, and especially renowned for their beauty, are the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/brooklyn-bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a> (1883), which was the city’s first suspension bridge, and the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/george-washington">George Washington</a> Bridge (1931). The Holland (1927) and Lincoln (1937–57) tunnels under the Hudson River link Manhattan with New Jersey. Important links among the five boroughs include the Triborough Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, Queensboro Bridge, Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, and Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The Staten Island Ferry conveys passengers and autos between the borough and lower Manhattan.</p><p>Off the Hudson River, one of the country’s major arteries, are the main elements of the New York Barge Canal System: the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/erie-canal">Erie Canal</a>, linking the Atlantic with Lake Erie, and New York City with Buffalo; the Oswego Canal, connecting the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/erie-canal">Erie Canal</a> with Lake Ontario; the Cayuga and Seneca Canal, connecting the Erie Canal with Cayuga and Seneca lakes; and the Champlain Canal, extending the state’s navigable waterways from the Hudson to Lake Champlain. Buffalo, on Lake Erie, is the most important inland port. Albany is the major port on the Hudson River and Port Jefferson serves the Long Island Sound.</p><p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the historic and economic importance of New York Harbor—haven for explorers, point of entry for millions of refugees and immigrants, and the nation’s greatest seaport until recent years, when it was surpassed by Greater <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> and Houston in terms of cargo tonnage. The entire port is under the jurisdiction of the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/port-authority-new-york-and">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>.</p><p>In 2005, New York State had 582 airfields, including 397 airports, 167 heliports, and 18 seaplane bases. By far the busiest airports in the state are <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-f-kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> International and La Guardia both in New York City. The Greater Buffalo International Airport is the largest in the state outside New York City.</p><h2><a id="K">11 History</a></h2><p>In 1570, after European explorers had discovered New York but before the establishment of any permanent European settlements, the main Iroquois tribes—the Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, Cayuga, and Mohawk—established the League of the Five Nations. For the next 200 years, members of the League generally kept peace among themselves but made war on other tribes, using not only traditional weapons but also the guns they were able to get from the French, Dutch, and English. In 1715, a sixth nation joined the League—the Tuscarora, who had fled the British in <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/north-carolina">North Carolina</a>. For much of the 18th century, the Iroquois skillfully balanced competing French and British interests.</p><p>The first European known to have entered New York Harbor was the Florentine navigator <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/giovanni-da-verrazano">Giovanni da Verrazano</a>, on 17 April 1524. The Frenchman <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/canadian-history-biographies/samuel-de-champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a> began exploring the St. Lawrence River in 1603. Six years later, English mariner <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/henry-hudson">Henry Hudson</a>, in the service of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/benelux-history/dutch-east-india-company">Dutch East India Company</a>, entered New York Bay and sailed up the river that would later bear his name. The first permanent Dutch settlement was established in 1624, and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> was founded in 1626, when <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/peter-minuit">Peter Minuit</a> bought Manhattan (from the Native American word <i>manahatin</i>, “hill island”) from the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/north-american-indigenous-peoples/native-americans">Native Americans</a> for goods worth—as tradition has it—about $24.</p><p>Though small and weak, the Dutch colony—named <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-netherland">New Netherland</a>—was an annoyance to the English, interfering with their trade monopoly and forming a political barrier between <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-england">New England</a> and two other English colonies, Maryland and Virginia. In 1664, King Charles II claimed “all the land from the west side of the Connecticutte River to the East Side of De La Ware Bay” for his brother, the Duke of York and Albany (the future King James II), and the English took control after a peaceful surrender by the Dutch. <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-netherland">New Netherland</a> became New York, and remained an English colony for the next 112 years, except for a period in 1673 when Dutch rule was briefly restored.</p><p><b>British Control</b> The first decades under the English were stormy. Leadership of the colony changed hands several times, reflecting political instability in England itself, as James became king and was then deposed in the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/british-and-irish-history/glorious-revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688. The succeeding decades were marked by conflict between the English and French and by the rising power of the provincial assembly in relations with the British crown. In 1756, the English were determined to drive the French out of the region once and for all, defeating them decisively in 1760. The <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/treaty-paris">Treaty of Paris</a> (1763), ending the French and Indian War, ceded almost all territory east of the Mississippi to England.</p><p>The signing of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/treaty-paris">Treaty of Paris</a> was followed by English attempts to tighten control over the colonies, in New York as elsewhere. In 1774, after <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/paul-revere">Paul Revere</a> brought news of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/boston-tea-party">Boston Tea Party</a> to New York City, British tea was also dumped into that city’s harbor. Nearly one-third of all battles during the Revolutionary War took place on New York soil. The action there began when troops under <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/ethan-allen">Ethan Allen</a> captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. The following year, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/george-washington">George Washington</a>’s forces were driven from Long Island and Manhattan by the British, and New York City remained in British hands for the rest of the war. British General <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/british-and-irish-history-biographies/john-burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> was defeated in October 1777 at Saratoga, in a battle that is often considered the turning point of the war. Washington marched into New York City on 25 November 1785, the day the British evacuated their forces.</p><p><b>Statehood</b> On 6 February 1778, New York had become the second state to ratify the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/articles-confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>. After much debate, in which Federalist <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/alexander-hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> played a leading role, the state ratified the US Constitution (with amendments) on 26 July 1788. New York City served as the seat of the US government from 11 January 1785 to 12 August 1790, and the first US president, George Washington, was inaugurated in the city on 30 April 1789.</p><p>The end of the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/war-1812">War of 1812</a> signaled an era of major economic expansion for the state, which was receiving large numbers of migrants from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-england">New England</a>. New York was the site of the early 19th century’s most ambitious engineering project: construction of the Erie Canal. Ground was broken for the canal in 1817, and the first vessels passed through the completed canal in 1825. The textile industry had established itself by the mid-1820s, and the dairy industry was thriving.</p><p>Commercial progress during this period was matched by social and cultural advancement. New York City became a center of literary activity during the 1820s. Slavery was abolished as of 4 July 1827, and New Yorkers soon took the lead in the growing antislavery movement. The first women’s rights convention in the United States was held in Seneca Falls in 1848. Also during the 1840s, the state saw the first of several great waves of European immigration.</p><p><b>1860 to 1930</b> The majority of New Yorkers voted for <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/abraham-lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> in the presidential election of 1860, and New Yorkers were among the readiest recruits to the Union side in the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a>. Enthusiasm for the conflict waned during the next two years, leading to civil unrest when the military draft reached New York City on 11 July 1863. But New York was not a wartime battleground, and overall the war and Reconstruction were very good for business.</p><p>The decades after the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a> ushered in an era of extraordinary commercial growth, accompanied by political corruption. This was the Gilded Age, during which entrepreneurs became multimillionaires and New York was transformed from an agricultural state to an industrial giant. The key to this transformation was the development of the railroads. The boom period for railroad construction reached its high point after 1867, when “Commodore” <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/cornelius-vanderbilt">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a> took over the New York Central. During the century’s last two decades, corporate names that today are household words began to emerge: Westinghouse Electric in 1886; General Electric (as Edison Electric) in 1889; Eastman Kodak in 1892. In 1882, another native New Yorker, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/business-leaders/john-d-rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>, formed the Standard Oil Trust. Although the trust would eventually be broken up, the Rockefeller family would help shape New York politics for many decades to come.</p><p>The period immediately following the Civil War also marked a new high in political influence for the Tammany Society (or “Tammany Hall”), headed by Democrat William March “Boss” Tweed, who effectively dominated New York City by buying votes and bribing legislators from 1857 until his exposure by the press in 1871. However, New York also produced outstanding and upright political leaders—many of whom went on to national prominence—during the nation’s second century. <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/grover-cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, though born in New Jersey, became mayor of Buffalo, then governor of New York, and finally the 22nd US president in 1885.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/theodore-roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was governor of New York, became US vice president, and finally president of the United States in 1901. In 1910, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/social-sciences-and-law/supreme-court-biographies/charles-evans-hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a> resigned the governorship to become an associate justice of the US Supreme Court. He also served as secretary of state, and in 1930 was appointed chief justice of the United States. Alfred E. Smith was four times elected governor and in 1928 became the first Roman Catholic candidate to be nominated by a major party for the presidency of the United States. That year saw the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) as governor of New York.</p><p><b>1930s to 1990s</b> The 1930s, a period of depression, ushered in a new wave of progressive government. From 1933 until 1945, FDR was in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/white-house">White House</a>. Roosevelt’s successor as governor was Herbert H. Lehman, whose Little <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/new-deal">New Deal</a> established the basic pattern of present state <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/social-1">social welfare</a> policies. The mayor of New York City at this time was the colorful and popular <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/fiorello-h-la-guardia">Fiorello H. La Guardia</a>.</p><p>The decades since <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-ii">World War II</a> saw extraordinary expansion of New York social services, including construction of the state university system, but also a decline in the state’s industry. The greatly increased scale of government in the 1970s brought on a financial crisis unheard of in its scope and implications. The city’s short-term debt grew from nearly zero to about $6 billion between 1970 and 1975. Eventually a package totaling $4.5 billion in aid was needed to avoid bankruptcy.</p><p>From the late 1970s through the late 1980s, New York enjoyed an economic boom, especially in finance, insurance, real estate, and construction. Prosperity did not reach all sectors of the economy or the population, however. Manufacturing jobs declined by 30%. By 1984, 25% of the residents of New York City lived below the poverty level. The collapse of the stock market in October of 1987, in which the market plunged 36% in two months, signaled the end of the boom and the beginning of a recession. Unemployment peaked in 1992, but by 1994 a recovery was underway.</p><p>The boom economy of the late 1990s boosted the stock market. In 1998 New York had the fourth-highest per capita income in the nation ($31,679) but it also had more people living below the poverty level than 45 other states, again indicating prosperity had not reached into all sectors. In November 1999 Governor Pataki signed the Jobs 2000 bill, committing up to $566 million to development of high-technology industries.</p><p>The 1990s witnessed a revitalization of New York City as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led efforts to empty the streets of blight. Continuing a trend begun under Mayor David Dinkins, the city’s murder rate for 1998 was the lowest in 35 years.</p><p>The 1990s witnessed the settlement of lawsuits surrounding <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/love-canal">Love Canal</a> in Buffalo, where leaking chemical wastes in the 1970s and early 1980s had prompted the state and federal governments to pay families to move from the area. The Occidental Petroleum Corporation agreed to pay $98 million in damages for dumping hazardous wastes at <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/love-canal">Love Canal</a>, ending 16 years of lawsuits.</p><p>In March 2000 the state sold two nuclear plants for a total of $967 million. It was the largest privatization of state assets in New York history.</p><p>Transportation in and around New York City was the focus of the statehouse and legislature in 2000. Governor George Pataki and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, a fellow Republican, cleared the way for the construction of a $200-million cargo hub for the world’s largest ocean carrier (<i>Maersk Sealand</i>) and reopened the possibility that the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a>, which the Port Authority still controlled, could be turned over to a private developer.</p><p>The possibility of privatizing the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/world-trade-center">World Trade Center</a> was eliminated on 11 September 2001, when terrorists took control of two commercial airplanes and flew them into the two towers, destroying both buildings and killing more than 2,750 people. New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani was praised for his effective handling of the crisis. Republican <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> was elected mayor in 2001, and reelected in 2005.</p><p>In 2003, Berlin-based architect <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/daniel-libeskind">Daniel Libeskind</a>’s design for rebuilding “Ground Zero” (the site of the demolished World Trade Center) was accepted.</p><p>Following a decline of the stock market on <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a> and the US recession in the early 2000s, New York was plagued with economic woes. In 2003, the state faced a budget deficit of $10 billion. Although the economy began to improve in 2004 and 2005, the state still faced a budget gap of $4.2 billion in 2005–06.</p><h2><a id="L">12 State Government</a></h2><p>New York has had four constitutions, adopted in 1777, 1822, 1846, and 1895.

Minor parties have sometimes meant the difference between victory and defeat for major party candidates in state and national elections. James Buckley, of New York’s Conservative Party, was elected to the US Senate in 1970.</p><p>In the November 1980 presidential elections, Republican nominee Ronald Reagan (with Conservative Party backing) won the state’s 41 electoral votes. Reagan carried the state again in 1984, despite the presence on the Democratic ticket of US Representative Geraldine Ferraro of Queens as the running mate of Walter Mondale. New Yorkers chose Democratic nominees Michael Dukakis, <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/bill-clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, and Al Gore in 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000, respectively. In 2000, Al Gore captured 60% of the vote while the challenger, Republican George W. Bush, won 35% of the vote. In 2004, the Democratic challenger, John Kerry, won 57.8% of the vote to the incumbent George, W. Bush’s 40.5%.</p><p>Democrat <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/mario-m-cuomo">Mario M. Cuomo</a> was defeated in his run for a fourth term as governor in November 1994 by Republican George Pataki. Pataki was elected to a third term in 2002. In 2006, Democrat Eliot Spitzer was elected governor. In 2006, New York’s US senators were Democrats Charles Schumer and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/hillary-rodham-clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>. Following the 2006 midterm elections, New York’s delegation to the US <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/house-representatives">House of Representatives</a> included 23 Democrats and 6 Republicans. Republicans held 34 seats in the state senate while Democrats held 27; there was 1 Independent. In the state assembly there were 105 Democrats and 45 Republicans. Forty-seven women were elected to the state legislature in 2006, or 22.2%.</p><p>In November 1993, New York City Mayor David Dinkins, a Democrat and New York’s first black mayor (in office since 1990), was defeated by a Republican, Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani was legally barred from seeking a third term and billionaire media tycoon <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> won the mayoral contest in 2001. Bloomberg was reelected in 2005.</p><h2><a id="N">14 Local Government</a></h2><p>The state constitution, endorsing the principle of home rule, recognizes many different levels of <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts/local">local government</a>. In 2005, New York had 62 counties, 616 municipal governments, 1,135 special districts, and 703 <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/public-school">public school</a> districts. In 2002, there were 929 townships. With the exception of some counties within New York City, each county has a county attorney and a district attorney, a sheriff, a treasurer, and other officers.</p><p>Cities are contained within counties, with one outstanding exception: New York City is made up of five counties, one for each of its five boroughs. Traditionally, counties are run by an elected board of supervisors or county legislature; however, a growing number of counties have vested increased powers in a single elected county executive.</p><p>Towns are run by a town board. The most important board member is the town supervisor, who is the board’s presiding officer and acts as town treasurer. A group of people within a town or towns may also incorporate themselves into a village, with their own elected mayor and elected board of trustees. Some villages have administrators or managers. The constitution grants the state legislature the power to decide which taxes the local governments may levy and how much debt they may incur.</p><p>New York City is governed by a mayor and city council, but much practical power resides in the Board of Estimate. On this board sit the city’s three top elected officials—the mayor, comptroller, and City Council president. The board also includes the five borough presidents. New York City government is further complicated by the fact that certain essential services are provided not by the city itself but by independent “authorities.” The <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/us-government/port-authority-new-york-and">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>, along with the Metropolitan Transit Authority are administered by the state government rather than the city.</p><h2><a id="O">15 Judicial System</a></h2><p>New York’s highest court is the court of appeals, in Albany, with appeals jurisdiction only, consisting of a chief judge and six associate judges. Below the court of appeals is the supreme court, which consists of 570 justices in 12 judicial districts. The supreme court of New York State does not sit as one body; instead, most supreme court justices are assigned original jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, while 56 justices are assigned to one of the court’s appeals divisions.</p><p>The New York court of claims, which sits in Albany, consists of judges appointed by the governor to nine-year terms, along with judges sitting as acting supreme court justices in felony trials. This special trial court hears civil cases involving claims by or against the state.</p><p>Outside New York City, each county has its own county court to handle criminal cases, although some are delegated to be handled by lower courts. Many counties have a surrogate’s court to handle such matters as wills and estate, and each county has its own family court. A county’s district attorney has authority in criminal matters. Most cities (including New York City) have their own court systems. Village police justices and town justices of the peace handle minor violations and other routine matters.</p><p>The state’s violent crime rate in 2004 was 441.6 per 100,000 persons. Crimes against property were reported at a rate of about 2,198.6 per 100,000 people. In December 2004, 63,751 inmates were in state and federal facilities. New York abolished the death penalty in 1965 and reestablished it in 1995. However, on 24 June 2004, New York’s death penalty statute was declared unconstitutional. The last execution in the state took place in 1963. As of 1 January 2006, only one inmate remained on death row.</p><h2><a id="P">16 Migration</a></h2><p>Since the early 1800s, New York has been the primary port of entry for Europeans coming to the United States. The <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/statue-liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>, dedicated in 1886 and beckoning “your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free” to the shores of America, was often an immigrant’s first glimpse of America. The first stop for some 20 million immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/ellis-island">Ellis Island</a>, where they were processed, often given Americanized names, and sent onward to an uncertain future.</p><p>The first great wave of European immigrants arrived in the 1840s, impelled by the potato famine in Ireland. The next two great waves of European immigration—Eastern European Jews and Italians—overlapped. Vast numbers of Jews began arriving from <a class="interlinked" href="/history/historians-and-chronicles/historians-european/eastern-europe">Eastern Europe</a> during the 1880s. The flood of Italians began during the 1800s as well.</p><p>Yankees from New England made up the first great wave of domestic migration. Most of the migrants who came to New York between 1790 and 1840 were Yankees. There was a slow, steady migration of <a class="interlinked" href="/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/african-americans">African Americans</a> from slave states to New York before the Civil War, but massive black migration to New York, and especially to New York City, began during <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-i">World War I</a> and continued well into the 1960s. The third great wave of domestic migration came after World War II, from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/latin-america-and-caribbean/caribbean-political-geography/puerto-rico">Puerto Rico</a>. Many other Caribbean natives—especially Dominicans, Jamaicans, and Haitians—followed.</p><p>The fourth and most recent domestic migratory trend is unique in New York history—the net outward migration from New York to other states.</p><p>In 1998, 96,559 foreign immigrants entered New York, the second-highest total of any state (surpassed only by California). In the period 1995–2000, some 726,477 people moved into the state and 1,600,725 moved out, for a net loss of 874,248. Of those who left the state, about 308,230 went to Florida, 206,979 went to New Jersey, 112,214 went to Pennsylvania, 100,727 went to <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/north-carolina">North Carolina</a>, and 95,952 went to California. The largest immigration came from New Jersey, with 97,584 people moving to New York.</p><p>For the period 2000–05, net international migration was 667,007 and net internal migration was -1,001,100 for a net loss of 334,093 people.</p><h2><a id="Q">17 Economy</a></h2><p>New York State cannot be economically healthy if New York City does not remain so. The city’s manufacturing industries and its skilled laborers, however, have been emigrating to the suburbs and to other states since World War II. Between 1969 and 1976, the city lost 600,000 jobs. In 1975, short-term aid from Congress, the state government, and the labor union pension funds were needed to save the city from default.</p><p>The early 1980s saw New York’s fortunes on the rise. A shift in dependence from manufacturing to services, and particularly to finance, helped the state and New York City weather the 1981–82 recession. In 1983, the state’s three largest industrial and commercial employers (excluding public utilities) were all banks based in New York City. Financial services led the city’s economic expansion during the 1980s, adding 100,000 jobs from 1980 to 1987. The expanding economy moved New York from 10th place in per capita (per person) income in 1980 to 5th place in 1990, when the state’s per capita income reached $21,073.</p><p>New York’s economy not only grew during the 1980s but also underwent a restructuring. Manufacturing witnessed a decline in its share of total employment from 20% in 1980 to 14% in 1990. Business-related, healthcare, education, and social services, however, grew 52% during the decade.</p><p>Employment rose steadily during the 1990s and economic growth was robust moving into the 21st century. Even with the effects of the 2001 national recession and the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the state economy grew by a rate of 3.5%. Employment growth in the state lagged behind the nation as a whole during 2001–02, but was close to the national average by the end of 2002. New York City’s rate of job losses, however, continued to exceed the state and the nation. The state’s manufacturing sector, which had been declining for decades, fell from 10.8% of the gross state product in 1997 to 9.4% in 2001. In 2002, the highest percentages of manufacturing job losses were in the cities of Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse.</p><p>In 2004, an estimated 62,854 new businesses were established while 64,013 businesses closed.</p><h2><a id="R">18 Income</a></h2><p>In 2005, New York had a gross state product (GSP) of $963 billion, ranking third among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 2001, New York ranked sixth among the 50 states and the District of Columbia with a per capita (per person) income of $38,264; the national average was $33,050. The average median household income for 2002–04 was $44,228 compared to the national average of $44,473. For the same period, 14.4% of the population lived below the federal poverty level, compared to the national average of 12.4%.</p><h2><a id="S">19 Industry</a></h2><p>Until the 1970s, New York was the nation’s foremost industrial state, ranking first in practically every general category. By 1982, however, it ranked third in value of shipments and new spending. In 1995, New York ranked sixth in value of shipments, at $162.9 billion. Important industries are instruments and related products, industrial machinery and equipment, electronic and electric equipment, printing and publishing, and textiles.</p><p>The Buffalo region, with its excellent transport facilities and abundant power supply, is the main center for heavy industry in the state. Light industry is distributed throughout the state. Rochester is especially well known for its photographic (Kodak), optical equipment, and office machines. The state’s leadership in electronic equipment is in large part attributable to the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/international-2">International Business</a> Machines Corporation (IBM), a leading US industrial corporation. The presence of two large General Electric plants has long made Schenectady a leader in the manufacture of electric machinery.</p><p>New York City excels not only in the apparel and publishing trades but also in food processing, meatpacking, chemicals, leather goods, metal products, and many other manufacturers. In addition, the city serves as headquarters for many large industrial corporations whose manufacturing activities often take place entirely outside New York. Large US industrial corporations and many of the world’s banking conglomerates have headquarters in New York City.</p><p>In 2004, the shipment value of products manufactured in the state amounted to over $146 billion.</p><h2><a id="T">20 Labor</a></h2><p>At the beginning of the 20th century, working conditions in New York were among the worst in the country. The flood of immigrants into the labor market and the absence of labor laws to protect them led to the development in New York City of cramped, ill-lit, poorly ventilated, unhealthy factories, the sweatshops for which the garment industry became notorious. Since that time working conditions in the garment factories have improved, primarily through the efforts of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union and, later, its sister organization, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textiles Workers Union.</p><p>In April 2006, the labor force in New York numbered 9,516,800, with approximately 467,000 workers unemployed, yielding an unemployment rate of 4.9%, compared to the national average of 4.7%. In 2006, 3.8% of the labor force was employed in construction; 6.5% in manufacturing; 17.5% in trade, transportation, and public utilities; 8.4% in financial activities; 12.7% in professional and business services; 18.2% in education and health services; 7.8% in leisure and hospitality services, and 17.3% in government.</p><p>In 2005, some 2,090,000 of New York’s 8,008,000 employed wage and salary workers were members of unions, representing 26.1% of those so employed. The national average was 12%.</p><h2><a id="U">21 Agriculture</a></h2><p>New York ranked 28th in farm income in 2005, with cash receipts from farming at over $3.5 billion. About 62% came from livestock products, mostly dairy goods. In 2004, the state ranked second in apples; third in the production of corn for silage, third in production of cauliflower, fourth in tart cherries and snap beans, and ninth in oats.</p><p>New York remains an important dairy state, but urbanization has reduced its overall agricultural potential. In 2004, there were only 36,000 farms, with 7.6 million acres (3.1 million hectares). The west-central part of the state is the most intensively farmed. Chautauqua County, in the extreme southwest, leads the state in grape production, while Wayne County along Lake Ontario leads in apples and cherries. The dairy industry is concentrated in the St. Lawrence Valley; grain growing dominates the plains between Syracuse and Buffalo. Potatoes are grown mostly in Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island.</p><p>Leading field crops in 2004 included hay, corn, oats, and wheat. Farms in 2004 also produced 941,010 tons of vegetables. Leading vegetable crops were cabbage, onions, sweet corn, and snap beans. State vineyards produced 145,000 tons of grapes for wine and juice in 2004, while the apple crop totaled 1.1 billion pounds (498.9 million kilograms).</p><h2><a id="V">22 Domesticated Animals</a></h2><p>The St. Lawrence Valley is the state’s leading cattle region, followed by the Mohawk Valley and Wyoming County in western New York. The poultry industry is more widely dispersed. In 2005, an estimated 1.41 million cattle and calves were worth around $1.73 billion. There were an estimated 84,000 hogs and pigs, worth $8.4 million in 2004. During 2003, around 14.6 million pounds (6.6 million kilograms) of chickens were produced, worth $5.1 million, and 13.3 million pounds (6 million kilograms) of turkey, worth $4.8 million.</p><p>New York is a leading dairy state. In 2003, New York was third in the United States in milk production with 11.9 million pounds (5.4 million kilograms) of milk from 671,000 milk cows.</p><p>Also during 2003, New York farmers produced around 3 million pounds (1.4 million kilograms) of sheep and lambs, which brought in around $2.7 million in gross income. The state produced around 1.05 billion eggs, valued at $56.3 million in 2003. Duck raising is an industry of local importance on Long Island.</p><h2><a id="W">23 Fishing</a></h2><p>Fishing, though an attraction for tourists and sport fishers, plays only a marginal role in the economic life of the state. In 2004, the Atlantic commercial catch in New York was 33.7 million pounds (15.3 million kilograms), valued at $46.4 million. The Great Lakes commercial catch the same year was 10,000 pounds (4,500 kilograms) valued at $11,000. Important species for commercial use are clams and oysters. In 2004, the state ranked second in the nation (after New Jersey) in volume of surf clams (6.8 million pounds/3.1 million kilograms). Soft clams amounted to 234,000 pounds (106,000 kilograms). Virtually all of New York’s commercial fishing takes place in the Atlantic waters off Long Island. Montauk, on the eastern end of Long Island, is the state’s leading fishing port. In 2003, there were 6 processing and 271 wholesale plants in the state with about 2,154 employees.</p><p>Pollution and poor wildlife management have seriously endangered the state’s commercial and sport fishing in the ocean, rivers, and lakes. Commercial fishing in the rivers for five species—black crappie, brown bullhead, carp, gold-fish, and pumpkinseed—was banned in 1985. Also banned in 1985 was commercial fishing for striped bass in New York Harbor and along both shores of western Long Island.</p><p>In recent decades, the Department of Environmental Conservation has taken an active role in restocking New York’s inland waters. The US Fish and Wildlife Service distributes large numbers of Atlantic salmon fingerlings as well as lake, rainbow, and brook trout fry throughout the state.

It has the largest population of any city in the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/united-states">United States</a>, and it is unrivaled in the diversity of its neighborhoods and their often-colorful residents. New York runs the gamut from great concentrations of wealth, epitomized by luxury apartment buildings and hotels and mammoth corporate headquarters, to the grinding urban poverty of its ethnic and racial ghettos. A major financial and economic center, it is also a cultural mecca that has attracted generations of artists and intellectuals and draws millions of tourists every year. In its 400-year history the city has grown and changed rapidly, repeatedly renewing itself through successive waves of immigration and urban development. As a new century approaches, it remains, perhaps more than anything else, a city on the move.</p><h2>2. <a id="GETTING_THERE">Getting There</a></h2><p>Located at the southeastern-most point in the state of New York, New York City is situated on the Atlantic coastal plain, at the mouth of the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/hudson-river">Hudson River</a>.</p><h3>Highways</h3><p>New York City is known for its traffic congestion, and many New Yorkers walk or use public transportation within the city itself. The major north-south interstate routes leading to New York are I-95 and I-87 (which approaches New York from the north only). In <a data-topic="1223420" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a>, I-95 becomes the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> Turnpike. East of the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/hudson-river">Hudson River</a>, it becomes the Cross Bronx Expressway before heading north up the coast of <a data-topic="1221785" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/new-england">New England</a>. I-95 leads to the Holland and Lincoln tunnels and the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/george-washington">George Washington</a> Bridge. I-87 (the New York Thruway) becomes the Major Deegan Expressway as it nears the city from the north. I-80 (the Bergen-Passaic Expressway) approaches New York heading eastward from <a data-topic="1233875" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>.</p><h3>Bus and Railroad Service</h3><p>Amtrak offers daily service to New York's Penn Station from <a data-topic="1208119" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/chicago">Chicago</a> (on the <i>Lake Shore Limited</i> ), <a data-topic="1218507" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/miami">Miami</a> (the <i>Silver Star</i> ), <a data-topic="1211066" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> (the <i>Crescent</i> ), <a data-topic="1238396" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/canadian-political-geography/toronto">Toronto</a> (the <i>Maple Leaf</i> ), and <a data-topic="1231828" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/canadian-political-geography/montreal">Montreal</a> (the <i>Adirondack</i> ). Amtrak also operates a high-speed rail shuttle, the Metroliner <i>,</i> between New York and Washington, D.C. Other rail lines that operate out of Penn Station are the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/long-island">Long Island</a> Railroad and <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> Transit. Metro-North operates service from <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-haven">New Haven</a>, Connecticut, and Poughkeepsie, New York, to <a data-topic="1213590" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/manhattan-new-york">Manhattan</a>'s Grand Central Railroad Terminal.</p><h3>Airports</h3><p>Almost every major domestic carrier operates flights to and from New York, as do most international airlines as well. The city is served by three major airports: <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-f-kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> International Airport (which handles over 200 international flights per day) and LaGuardia Airport, both in <a data-topic="1228025" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/queens">Queens</a>, and Newark International Airport in New Jersey.</p><h2>New York Population Profile</h2><h3>City Proper</h3><p><b>Population:</b> 7,333,000<br/><b>Area:</b> 800 sq km (308.9 sq mi)<br/><b>Ethnic composition:</b> 63.9% white; 28.7% black; 7% Asian/Pacific Islander<br/><b>Nicknames:</b> The Big Apple; The Empire City</p><h3>Metropolitan Area</h3><p><b>Population:</b> 16,626,000<br/><b>Description:</b> New York City and surrounding communities<br/><b>World population rank</b> <sup>1</sup><b>:</b> 5<br/><b>Percentage of national population</b> <sup>2</sup><b>:</b> 6.0%<br/><b>Average yearly growth rate:</b> 0.4%<br/><b>Ethnic composition:</b> 91.2% white; 4.4% black; 3.4% Asian/Pacific Islander</p><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span><ol><li>The New York metropolitan area's rank among the world's urban areas.</li><li>The percent of the United States' total population living in the New York metropolitan area.</li></ol><h3>Shipping</h3><p>New York is home to two <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/economics-terms-and-concepts/foreign-trade">Foreign Trade</a> Zones<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>one at Kennedy International Airport and one at the <a data-topic="1214417" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> Navy Yard<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>which encourage trade by

pattern that dates back to the days of Dutch settlement in the seventeenth century. As settlement later expanded northward, a grid pattern of streets and avenues emerged. The streets run east-west, with numbers ascending northward; avenues run north-south, with numbers ascending westward. Fifth Avenue, running north-south, is the dividing line between streets labeled "east" and "west": to the east of Fifth Avenue, 23rd Street is East 23rd, to the west it is West 23rd. Instead of numbers, a few avenues east of Fifth Avenue are labeled by names (Madison, Park, Lexington) or, in the southern part of the city, letters (A, B, C, and D). In addition, Sixth Avenue is also known as Avenue of the Americas, and some of the other numbered avenues on the west side are known by other names above 59th Street (<a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/central-park">Central Park</a> West, Columbus, <a data-topic="1209880" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/benelux-political-geography/amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, and West End avenues).</p><p>The streets and avenues north of 14th Street are perpendicular to each other except for <a data-topic="1211095" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/broadway">Broadway</a>, which runs diagonally across the island, northwest to southeast, from the Upper West Side to 14th Street, after which it runs southward to the tip of Manhattan, serving as the dividing line between east and west for this section of the island. The famous "squares" of the city (<a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/times-square">Times Square</a>, Herald Square, Union Square, etc.) are located at the intersections of Broadway and the major avenues.</p><p>A major point of reference in upper Manhattan is <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/central-park">Central Park</a>, which runs northward from 59th to 110th streets and from Fifth to Eighth avenues (Eighth Avenue is called Central Park West for the length of the park).</p><h3>Bus and Commuter Rail Service</h3><p>New York's subway system is one of the largest in the world, with 1,149 kilometers (714 miles) of track and 469 stations. Trains run 24 hours a day, making frequent stops during rush hour and other daytime hours. Both local and express trains are available. Buses run daily from 6:00 am to 9:00 pm in all five boroughs; more than 200 routes are covered by a fleet of 3,700 buses. Taxicabs are a popular mode of transportation in Manhattan<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>during peak traffic hours, an ocean of yellow cabs seem to fill the city's streets. Taxi stands abound throughout the city, and cabs can be easily hailed in most areas.</p><h3>Sightseeing</h3><p>Visitors may tour New York in organized tours by trolley or double-decker bus, and many walking tours of specific neighborhoods are offered, as well as self-guided walking tours of historic sites in Manhattan. Brief helicopter tours offer a dramatic view of the Manhattan skyline, as do scenic cruises of New York Harbor. In addition there are many specialized tours of specific sites, including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Radio City, and the studios of the NBC television network.</p><h2>4. <a id="PEOPLE">People</a></h2><p>New York is the nation's most populous city and has more than twice the
population of its nearest competitor, <a data-topic="1215160" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>. In 1990, the population of New York was 7,323,000, with the following racial composition: 63.9 percent white, 28.7 percent black, and seven percent Asian/Pacific Islander, with other groups accounting for percentages of less than one percent. Hispanics (an ethnic rather than a racial designation) accounted for 24.4 percent of the population. The 1994 population estimate was 7,333,000. The population of the New York Primary <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/economics-terms-and-concepts/metropolitan">Metropolitan Statistical Area</a> was estimated at 8,611,099 as of 1997. The region's racial composition was listed by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1996 as 91.2 percent white; 4.4 percent black; and 3.4 percent Asian/Pacific Islander. Hispanics accounted for two percent of the metropolitan area population.</p><h2>5. <a id="NEIGHBORHOODS">Neighborhoods</a></h2><p>In the busy financial district in lower Manhattan, the maze of narrow streets laid down during the oldest period of the city's history are home to the towering skyscrapers of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/wall-street">Wall Street</a>, the nation's foremost symbol of financial power and prosperity. To the north of the financial district lie New York's
teeming, colorful Chinatown and Tribeca ("Triangle Below Canal Street"), a former market district whose warehouses have been converted to artists' lofts and galleries to create one of Manhattan's trendiest upscale residential neighborhoods, graced by fashionable shops and restaurants.</p><p>The chic SoHo ("South of <a data-topic="1214848" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/houston">Houston</a>"; pronounced HOW-stun) neighborhood just to the north of Tribeca has had a similar history of rejuvenation fueled by its popularity with the artistic community; today, however, gentrification has brought the district out of reach of many artists<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>like the ones who were responsible for the rebirth of the neighborhood in the 1960s. To the east of SoHo are Little Italy, known for its authentic Italian cuisine, and the Lower East Side, the former home to a teeming population of Eastern European immigrants and today a mecca for shoppers in search of both local color and bargains on Orchard Street.</p><p><a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/greenwich-village">Greenwich Village</a>, between Houston (pronounced HOW-stun) and 14th streets and west of Broadway, is the historical capital of Bohemianism in America, once home to a dizzying array of artists, writers, musicians, and political radicals. Like other once-marginal areas of New York, the Village has become a prime upscale neighborhood with soaring rents, including some of the highest in the city. However, it is still a colorful area and cultural mecca, as well the center of the city's gay community and home to three colleges: New York University, Parsons School Design, and the <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/new-school-social-research">New School for Social Research</a>. The East Village, located, as its name suggests, east of <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/greenwich-village">Greenwich Village</a>, is the edgier counterpart of the Village, although even this formerly gritty area has become more fashionable and expensive since the 1980s. However, it remains a focal point for the city's pierced and tattooed youth culture, a popular site for after-hours clubs, and an ethnically diverse area.</p><p>Chelsea, stretching from 14th Street to about 30th Street, west of Sixth Avenue, is yet another neighborhood traditionally linked with artists and writers, especially through its most famous landmark, the Chelsea Hotel. Today it is home to large Hispanic and gay communities, and its "main drag," Eighth Avenue between 15th and 23rd streets, is known for its cafes, bistros, boutiques, fitness clubs, and the Chelsea Piers sports complex, which includes a climbing wall. Midtown Manhattan is primarily a business rather than a residential neighborhood. Home to numerous corporate head-quarters<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>including those of many entertainment and communications giants<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>it is also the site of landmarks including Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/museum-modern-art">Museum of Modern Art</a>, and the main branch of the New York Public Library, "guarded" by the famous stone lions outside its front entrance.</p><p>New York's Upper West Side is a colorful, heavily residential area that is home to many middle-class families and young professionals, although its residents run the gamut from homelessness to upper-echelon wealth. The
neighborhood's landmarks include the Lincoln Center performing arts complex, the Museum of Natural History, and, at its northernmost point, <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/columbia-university">Columbia University</a>. The major thoroughfare in this district is Broadway, which offers a wide variety of shopping experiences, including Zabar's gourmet foods and <a data-topic="1207892" href="/people/literature-and-arts/english-literature-1500-1799-biographies/william-shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> &amp; Company's eclectic book selection. The Upper East Side is New York's most exclusive neighborhood. Its residents live in posh apartment buildings with uniformed doormen; its visitors stay at luxury hotels. It is home to Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses, Bloomingdale's, and a host of foreign embassies and consulates, as well as the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-museums/metropolitan-museum-art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and the Guggenheim and Frick museums.</p><p>Washington Heights, at the northern end of the city, is primarily a Latino enclave. Home to the largest Dominican population in the United States, in recent decades it has been plagued by problems associated with the drug trade. However, it is still the site of noteworthy landmarks, including the Cloisters (home of the Metropolitan Museum's medieval collection), the Audubon Ballroom, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, and <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/yeshiva-university">Yeshiva University</a>. Beginning at 125th Street on the West Side and 96th Street on the East Side, Harlem is America's most famous black neighborhood. From the days of the 1920s literary and cultural phenomenon known as the <a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/literature-english/american-literature/harlem-renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</a> until urban decay and violence set in the 1960s, the neighborhood was a unique cultural and political center and home to many famous black musicians and intellectuals, and such historic venues as the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater.</p><h2>6. <a id="HISTORY">History</a></h2><p>Four hundred years ago, the present-day site of New York City was forest land inhabited by Algonquin and Iroquois Indians who called the central island "Manhattan," which meant "city of hills." In 1609 <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/henry-hudson">Henry Hudson</a> (c. 1550<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>1611), an Englishman employed by the <a class="interlinked" href="/history/modern-europe/benelux-history/dutch-east-india-company">Dutch East India Company</a>, sailed up the river that now bears his name, and settlement of the region began five years later.

The rapidly growing town had about 4,000 residents by the turn of the century, and had nearly doubled its population by 1720, becoming the third-largest population center in the British colonies. New Yorkers played an active role in the agitation that led to the American Revolutionary Revolutionary War (1775<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>83). The city was overrun and occupied by British forces early in the war, and the occupation continued
throughout the conflict. In the period after the colonies won their independence, New York served briefly as the seat of the new nation's government (from 1785 to 1790).</p><p>By the beginning of the nineteenth century, New York<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>with a population of 30,000<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>had become the nation's second-largest city, after Philadelphia. In the first half of the century, the city's growth was further bolstered by the opening of the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/erie-canal">Erie Canal</a> linking the East Coast with the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/great-lakes">Great Lakes</a>, and by the first waves of mass immigration, from <a data-topic="1214285" href="/places/britain-ireland-france-and-low-countries/british-and-irish-political-geography/ireland">Ireland</a>, <a data-topic="1211417" href="/places/germany-scandinavia-and-central-europe/german-political-geography/germany">Germany</a>, and <a data-topic="1219729" href="/places/germany-scandinavia-and-central-europe/scandinavian-political-geography/scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. Although New York was a center of the abolitionist movement, pro-slavery feeling was strong among unskilled laborers who feared that their jobs would be threatened by freed slaves. The <a data-topic="1213812" href="/history/ancient-greece-and-rome/ancient-history-rome/civil-war">Civil War</a> (1861<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>65) brought a new economic boom, and the city's population reached one million by the 1870s. By this time, New York's government had become a locus of graft and corruption under the infamous Tammany Hall political machine, which spurred a series of political reforms. The last two decades of the century saw new waves of immigration, much of it from <a class="interlinked" href="/history/historians-and-chronicles/historians-european/eastern-europe">Eastern Europe</a>, and the completion of some of the city's greatest landmarks, including the <a data-topic="1213464" href="/literature-and-arts/performing-arts/music-history/metropolitan-opera-company">Metropolitan Opera</a> House and the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-national-park-system/statue-liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> (1882), and the <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/brooklyn-bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a> (1883).

growth of Greenwich Village as a bohemian mecca for writers and others involved in the arts.

Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia (1882<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>1947; mayor, 1933<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>1945) led the city through these dark times, which nevertheless saw the construction of the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and the Chrysler Building, the reform of <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-science-terms-and-concepts/local">local government</a>, the hosting of two World's Fairs, and the introduction of the Art Deco style into art and architecture.</p><p>New York's international stature was further enhanced with the establishment of <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/united-nations/united-nations">United Nations</a> headquarters in the city following <a data-topic="1208027" href="/history/modern-europe/wars-and-battles/world-war-ii">World War II</a> (1939<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>45). It was also during the post-war era that the city became an international leader in the fields of culture and fashion. In every decade, the city became a focal point for trends in popular culture, from the literary "<a class="interlinked" href="/literature-and-arts/literature-english/american-literature/beat-generation">beat generation</a>" of the 1950s to the counterculture of the 1960s and the opening of the disco club Studio 54 in the 1970s. Beginning in the 1950s, a wave of Puerto Rican immigration and increased migration of blacks to the city from rural areas transformed the city's ethnic makeup, leading to the flight of whites from the city and the eruption of racial tensions in the 1960s. The erosion of the city's tax base, aggravated by the flight of businesses, brought the city to the point of bankruptcy by 1975. It was rescued by the newly formed Municipal Assistance Corporation, and a new mayor, Ed Koch (b. 1924; mayor 1978<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>90) helped reverse the city's decline through his policies and his popularity with ordinary citizens.</p><p>By the late 1980s New York, together with much of the country, was slipping into recession. In 1989 the city elected its first black mayor, David Dinkins (b. 1927; mayor 1990<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>1994), who was replaced in the 1993 mayoral election by U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani (b. 1944; mayor 1994<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>), the first <a data-topic="1212839" href="/social-sciences-and-law/political-science-and-government/political-parties-and-movements/republican">Republican</a> to hold the post in 28 years. The city's fortunes revived in the 1990s as the city shared in the country's economic upswing, and tourism boomed. Giuliani was credited with a major decrease in the New York's crime rate, although the city's police department drew universal condemnation in the late 1990s for widely publicized incidents of brutality against members of minority groups.</p><h2>7. <a id="GOVERNMENT">Government</a></h2><p>New York City has a mayor-council government. The mayor and the council president (who presides over council meetings) are elected to four-years terms by all the city's voters. Of the 51 council members (all of whom also serve four-year terms), 35 are elected from their own districts, and 16 are elected at large. New York had an estimated 232,588 city employees in 1997.</p><h2>8. <a id="PUBLIC_SAFETY">Public Safety</a></h2><p>In spite of its violent reputation, New York City actually has less crime per capita than a number of other major cities, including Washington,
D.C., Boston, <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-political-geography/new-orleans">New Orleans</a>, and <a data-topic="1210778" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/dallas">Dallas</a>. The city's crime rate actually has dropped in recent years, thanks partly to public safety policies, such as gun amnesties and gun confiscation, as well as anti-drug initiatives. In 1997, New York's crime rate was the lowest it had been since 1968. The New York Police Department is one of the country's largest. It covers a jurisdiction of some 829 square kilometers (320 square miles) and has an annual budget of $2.4 million. Over 38,000 uniformed officers and about 9,000 civilians are employed by the department. The city's five boroughs are divided into eight Patrol Borough Commands, which are in turn subdivided into 76 precincts.</p><p>In 1995, violent crimes reported to police (per 100,000 population) totaled 1,573 and included 16 murders, 32 rapes, 810 robberies, and 715 aggravated assaults. Property crimes totaled 4,503 and included 1,009 burglaries, 2,500 cases of larceny/theft, and 993 motor vehicle thefts.</p><h2>9. <a id="ECONOMY">Economy</a></h2><p>With over 200,000 businesses<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>and the headquarters of some 65 <i>Fortune 500</i> companies<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>New York is one of the

In addition to banking and finance, New York is also an important center for the major service industries of insurance, accounting, and law.</p><p>New York is the nation's publishing capital. By far the largest number of major publishers in the country are located here, as well as the two leading newsmagazines, <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek,</i> and the major wire services, the Associated Press and United Press International. Film and television production are also thriving industries in New York. <a class="interlinked" href="/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/madison-avenue">Madison Avenue</a> is famed as the world's advertising capital, and the city boasts over 1,000 ad agencies.</p><p>Although it now takes a back seat to the service sector, manufacturing still plays an active role in New York's economy. The city is home to some 11,000 manufacturers and 20 industrial parks. The garment industry, in which the city has historically been a leader, still employs approximately 75,000 people, and the city is known worldwide as a center of high fashion. New York is also known for its diamond and jewelry industry, which has traditionally been centered around Canal Street and West 47th Street. Newer sectors that are emerging as industrial leaders include semiconductors, computer equipment, and health-care equipment.</p><h2>10. <a id="ENVIRONMENT">Environment</a></h2><p>Although New York is better known for skyscrapers and traffic congestion, the city Department of Parks and Recreation has jurisdiction over 834 square kilometers (322 square miles) of urban wilderness, including 83,368 hectares (206,000 acres) of parkland and 2,024 hectares (5,000 acres) of forest preserves. Also included in the resources protected by the parks department are approximately 500,000 trees located on the city's streets. These trees are also protected by the Department of Environmental Conservation and citizens' groups, notably Trees New York, founded in 1976.</p><p>In addition, volunteers are helping restore 341 hectares (843 acres) of wild-life habitat in Central Park, including areas frequented by migrating birds and the New Yorkers who gather regularly to watch them. Also within the city's borders are beachfront wildlife habitats, such as that along Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, which is home to two federally listed <a class="interlinked" href="/science-and-technology/biology-and-genetics/environmental-studies/endangered-species">endangered species</a> and one listed by the state of New York. The city's Urban Park Rangers have taken measures to protect these rare beach-dwelling species, including monitoring, patrolling, vehicle exclusion, and fencing.</p><h2>11. <a id="SHOPPING">Shopping</a></h2><p>New York is a mecca for shoppers, in terms of sheer abundance and variety. The most famous shopping venue is Fifth Avenue, with its major department stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue
and Lord &amp; Taylor, and large bookstores (Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, Rizzoli). Specialty retailers include Cartier, Tiffany, the Warner Brothers Studio Store, and the famed toy store FAO Schwarz. Also located on Fifth Avenue is the Trump Tower shopping complex, which boasts more than 40 stores and restaurants. Seventh Avenue is home to garment and fur wholesalers (some of which will also sell retail). In the Chelsea neighborhood are the Manhattan Mall and Macy's (West 34th St.), the world's largest department store.</p><p>The Upper East Side mixes upscale retailers, including Bloomingdale's, with fashionable second-hand shops. The Lower East Side is famous as a bargain hunter's paradise, with designer clothing and other high-quality items regularly sold at a discount, especially on Orchard Street, the best-known shopping venue in the area. Specialty shops and boutiques abound in Greenwich Village, whose Bleecker Street is home to ethnic bakeries and grocery stores.</p><p>A special form of shopping is available at New York's exclusive auction houses, which include Christie's and Sotheby's, and the city's many museum gift shops also offer unusual and high-quality items.</p><p>Mixing commerce and local color are New York's open-air markets, which sell everything from flowers to antiques. Specialty gourmet food markets include Dean &amp; Deluca, Zabar's, and Balducci's.</p><h2>12. <a id="EDUCATION">Education</a></h2><p>In the fall of 1996 the New York City Public School System<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>the nation's largest<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>enrolled 1,063,561 students in grades K through 12; 16.1 percent were white, and 83.9 percent belonged to minorities, including 37.3 percent Hispanic, 36.1 percent black, and ten percent Asian/Pacific Islander. The school system operated 1,120 schools with a staff of 110,709, of whom 57,338 were teachers, making a pupil-teacher ratio of 18 to one. The school system has won acclaim for its career magnet schools, which include the High School of Music and Art, the High School of Fashion Industries, the School of the Performing Arts, the New York School of Printing, Bronx High School of Science, and Stuyvesant High School.</p><p>The <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/colleges-us/city-university-new-york">City University of New York</a> operates branches in all five boroughs, including eight <a class="interlinked" href="/social-sciences-and-law/education/education-terms-and-concepts/liberal-arts">liberal arts</a> colleges, the <a class="interlinked" href="/philosophy-and-religion/judaism/judaism/mount-sinai">Mount Sinai</a> School of Medicine, and the <a class="interlinked" href="/people/history/us-history-biographies/john-jay">John Jay</a> College of Criminal Justice.

Although competition from the city's spirited tabloid publications has expanded the <i>Times'</i> local coverage, it is still known for the breadth and depth of its international and national coverage and its news analysis, as well as its coverage of specific areas such as business and the arts. Favorite features of the Sunday edition include the weekly magazine, the book review supplement (whose reviews are influential throughout the literary and academic world), and the notoriously huge and difficult <a class="interlinked" href="/sports-and-everyday-life/games/games-and-hobbies/crossword-puzzle">crossword puzzle</a>.</p><p>Specializing in local news are the city's two remaining tabloid newspapers, the <i>New York Post</i> (the city's oldest newspaper, founded in 1801), and the <i>New York Daily News.</i> Among the most-quoted examples of their bold banner headlines are the <i>Daily News'</i> "FORD TO CITY<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>DROP DEAD" (referring to President Gerald Ford and the 1970s budget crisis) and the <i>Post</i> 's "HEADLESS WOMAN FOUND IN TOPLESS BAR."

sports. The New York Yankees of the American League, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, are the city's most famous sports team. The team of such baseball legends as <a class="interlinked" href="/people/sports-and-games/sports-biographies/babe-ruth">Babe Ruth</a> (1895<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>1948) and <a class="interlinked" href="/people/sports-and-games/sports-biographies/joe-dimaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> (1914<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>99), the Yankees have won more World Series than any other baseball team.

Designed by famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead (1822<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>1903), together with <a class="interlinked" href="/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/calvert-vaux">Calvert Vaux</a> (1824<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2013;</span></span></span></span></span></span>95), the park was laid out between 1859 and 1870. In spite of its association with some high-profile crimes, the park is still heavily used by a wide spectrum of New Yorkers, from joggers and rollerbladers to picnicking families. Special features of the park include the Central Park Zoo (and recently opened children's petting zoo), International Peace Garden, Belvedere Castle Shakespeare Garden, Conservatory Garden, and many others. Other parks in Manhattan include Battery Park, at the island's southern-most tip; Bryant Park, located behind the public library at 42nd Street; Union Square Park, Gramercy Park, and Washington Square Park.</p><p>The Bronx Zoo<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>one of the nation's most famous<span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">&#x2014;</span></span></span></span></span></span>is home to more than 4,000 animals.

Also located in the Bronx is the 101-hectare (250-acre) New York Botanical Garden, the city's oldest and largest public garden. Brooklyn is home to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Prospect Park, and Flushing Meadow-Corona Park is located in Queens.</p><p>In Manhattan, Central Park is a favorite venue for recreational activities of many kinds, including jogging, inline skating, walking, frisbee, and bicycling (altogether New York has some 161 kilometers/100 miles of bicycle paths).

Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.</p><p> Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.

Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.</p><p> Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates. Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:</p><div><h4>Modern Language Association</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mla.org/style">http://www.mla.org/style</a></p><h4>The Chicago Manual of Style</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html</a></p><h4>American Psychological Association</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="http://apastyle.apa.org/">http://apastyle.apa.org/</a></p></div><h5>Notes:</h5><ul class="citationnotes"><li> Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers. Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content. However, the date of retrieval is often important. Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.</li><li> In addition to the MLA, Chicago, and APA styles, your school, university, publication, or institution may have its own requirements for citations. Therefore, be sure to refer to those guidelines when editing your bibliography or works cited list.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><div class="label-citation"><div class="icon-citation"> <button class="copy-citation"> <i class="fas fa-copy"></i> </button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="block-trustme-bottomcontentad"></div><div id="block-moretopicsfromencyclopediacom"><h4>More From encyclopedia.com</h4><div class="bib--rcm-init"><div class="bib__module bib--hover bib--grd-6"></div></div></div></div><div class="col-md-3"><div class="zaga-border"><h4>About this article</h4><h1>New York</h1><div id="ency-topic-filter"><div class="btn ency-filter-topic active">All Sources <b> - </b></div></div><div class="ency-topic-info"> <span class="ency-node-updated"> Updated <b>Aug 13 2018</b> </span> <span class="ency-about-topic"> About <a href="/about"><b>encyclopedia.com content</b></a> </span> <span class="ency-print-topic pagetools_printAll"> Print Topic </span></div></div><div><div id="block-trustme-rightcolumntopad"><div style='height: 300px; width: 300px; overflow: hidden;'></div></div><div id="block-trustme-media"><div class="modal fade" id="topic-gallery" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"
