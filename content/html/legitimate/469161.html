This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you.

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner

LAWS OF LAWN TENNIS- 



THE COURT. 

I. The Court is 78 feet long and 27 feet wide. It is 
divided across the middle by a net, the ends of which are 
attached to two posts, A and B, standing 3 feet outside 
of the court on either side. Tlie height of the net is 3 feet 
6 inches at the posts, and 3 feet in the middle. At each end 




of the court, parallel with the net, and 39 feet from it, are 
drawn the base lines D E and F C, the ends of which are 
connected by the side lines D F and E C. Halfway 
between the side lines, and parallel with them, is drawn the 
half court line I H , dividing the space on each side of the 
net into two equal parts, the right and left courts. On each 
side of the net, at a distance of 21 feet from it, and parallel 
with it, are drawn the service lines K L and M N.

12 Laws of Lawn Tennis 

THE BALLS. 

S. The Balls shall measure not less than 2^ inches, nor 
more than 2 9-16 inches in diameter; and shall weigh not 
less than 1 15-16 ounces, nor more than 2 ounces. 

THE GAME. 

3. The choice of sides, and the right to serve in the first 
game, shall bejecided by toss; provided that, if the winner 
of the toss choose the right to serve, the other player shall 
have choice of sides, and vice versa, or the winner of the toss 
may insist upon a choice by his opponent. If one player 
choose the court, the other may elect not to serve. 

4. The players shall stand on opposite sides of the net; 
the palyer who first delivers the ball shall be called the 
server, and the other the striker-out. 

5. At the end of the first game the striker-out shall 
become server, and the server shall become striker-out; and 
so on alternately in all the subsequent games of the set and 
following sets. 

FOOT FAULT RULE. 

Law 6. The server shall before commencing to serve stand with 
both feet at rest behind (i.e., further from the net than) the base-line and 
within the limits of the imaginary continuation of the half -court and side- 
lines, and thereafter the server shall not run, walk, hop or jump before 
the service has been delivered, but the server inav raise one foot from 
(and, if desired, replace it on) the ground, provided that both feet are 
kept behind the base line until the service has been delivered. 

|f 

Official Interpretation of law 6. If a foot be lifted anxl replaced, there 

must be no change of position that can possibly be considered a step. 

IjAW 7. — ^The service shall be delivered from the right and left courts 
alternately, beginning from the right in every game, even though odds be 
given or owed, and the ball served shall drop within the service-line, half 
court-line and side-line of the court which is diagonally opposite to that 
from which it was served or upon any such line. 

Law 8. — It is a fault if the server commit any breach of Law 7, or if 
the service be delivered from the wrong court, or if the ball served drop in 
the net or beyond the service line, or if it drop out of court or in the 
wrong court. If the server in attempting to serve, miss the ball alto- 
gether, it does not count a fault; but if the ball be touched, no matter 
how sUghtly, by the racket, a service is thereby delivered, and the laws 
governing the service at once apply. 



Laws of Lawn Tennis. 13 

». It is a Fault if the ball served drop in the net, or be- 
yond the service line, or out of court, or in the wrong court; 
or if the server do not stand as directed by law 6. If the 
server, in attempting to serve, miss the ball altogether, it does 
not count a fault, but if the ball be touched, no matter how 
slightly, by the racket, a service is thereby delivered, and the 
laws governing the service at once apply. 

9. A fault cannot be taken. 

10. After a fault the server shall serve again from the 
same court from which he served that fault, unless it was a 
fault because he served from the wrong court. 

11. A fault cannot be claimed after the next service is 
delivered. 

12. The server shall not serve till the striker-out is ready. 
If the latter attempt to return the service, he shall be deemed 
ready. 

13. A service or fault delivered when the striker-out is 
not ready counts for nothing. 

14. The service shall not be volleyed, that is, taken, be- 
fore it has touched the ground. 

15. A ball is in play on leaving the server's racket, except 
as provided for in law 8, and remains in play till the stroke 
is decided. 

16. It is a good return, although the ball touch the net; 
hut a service, otherwise good, which touches the net shall 
count for nothing. 

17. The server wins a stroke if the striker-out volley the 
service, or if he fail to return the service or the ball in play ; 
or if he return the service or the ball in play so that it drops 
outside of his opponent's court; or if he otherwise lose a 
stroke, as provided by law 20. 

18. The striker-out wins a stroke if the server serve two 
consecutive faults; or if he fail to return the ball in play; 
or if he return the ball in play so that it drops outside of his 
opponent's court ; or if he otherwise lose a stroke as pro- 
vided by law 2a 



14 Laws of Lawn Tennis. 

19. A ball falling on a line is regarded as falling in the 
court bounded by that line. 

20. Either player loses a stroke if the ball touch him, or 
anything that he wears or carries, except his racket in the

while the ball is in play; or if he volley the ball before it 
has passed the net. 

21. In case a player is obstructed by any accident, not 
within his control, the ball shall be considered a "let" 
But when a permanent fixture of the court is the cause of the 
accident, the point shall be counted. The benches and 
chairs placed around the court shall be considered permanent 
fixtures. If, however, a ball in play strike a permanent fix- 
ture of the court (other than the net or posts) before it 
touches the ground, the point is lost; if after it has touched 
the ground, the point shall be counted. 

22. On either player winning his first stroke, the score is 
called 15 for that player; on eiiher player .&gt;i'inning his sec- 
ond stroke, the score is called 30 for that player; on either 
player winning his third stroke, the score is called 40 for that 
player; and the fourth stroke won by either player is scored 
game for that player, except as below. If both players have 
won three strokes, the score is called (/fuca ; and the next 
stroke won by either player is scored advantage for that

except as below : If both players win five games the score is 
oalled games all; ai^d the next game won by either player is

win the next game, he wins the set; if he lose the next game, 
the score returns to games all; and so on, until either player 
wins the two games immediately following the score of game* 
all, when he wins the set. But the committee having charge 
of any tournament may in their discretion modify this rule by 
the omission of advantage sets. 

24. The players shall change sides at the end of the first, 
third and every subsequent alternate game of each set and 
9k the end of each set, unless the number of games in such 
set be even. It shall, however, be open to the players by 
mutual consent and notification to the umpire before the 
opening of the second game of the match to change sides in- 
stead at the end of every set until the odd and concluding 
set, in which they shall change sides at the end of the first, 
third and every subsequent alternate game of such set. 
* 25. In all contests the play shall be continuous from the 
first service till the match be concluded; provided, however, 
that at the end of the third set either player is entitled to a 
rest, which shall not exceed seven minutes; and provided, 
further, that in case of an unavoidable accident, not within 
the control of the contestants, a cessation of play which shall 
not exceed two minutes may be allowed between points; but 
this proviso shall be strictly construed, and the privilege never 
granted for the purpose of allowing a player to recover his 
strength or wind. The referee in his discretion may at any 
time postpone the match on account of darkness or condition 
of the ground or weather. In any case of postponement, the 
previous score shall hold good. Where the play Ivis ceased

as the mistake is discovered, shall direct the player to serve 
who ought to have served. But all strokes scored before

completed before such discovery, then the service in the next 
alternate game shall be delivered by the player who did not 
serve out of his turn, and so on in regular rotation.

table, No. i. To use the table, find in the diagonal line of 
Bgtires the number representing the class of the superior 
player, then travel along the horizontal column until the 
vertieal column is reached which bears at the top the number 
of the class of the inferior player. The odds specified at the 
intersection of the two columns are the odds required. 

Example. — If class 3 has to meet class 9, start from the 
figure 3 in the diagonal line of figures, and look horizontally 
antil the vertical column is reached headed by the figure 9. 
The odds given at the point of intersection of the two 
columns (viz., 15 and 1-6 of 15) are the odds required. 

When the difference between the best and the worst 
players entered is great (say more than 30), it is desirable to 
handicap the best players at owed odds. The players above

Manaobment of tournaments. 35 

When the two players in different classes above scratch 
meet, the inferior player shall start from scratch, and the 
odds owed by the superior player are as shown by the 
annexed table. No. 2. 

This table is to be used in the same way as the former, the 
class of the superior player being looked for in the horizontal 
line of figures at the top, and the class of the inferior player 
in the diagonal line of figures. 

Example. — If class 12 (owe 30) meet class 7 (owe 15 and 
1-6 of 15), the former must owe the latter the odds of 4-6 
of 15. 

21. — In Championship matches and handicaps by classes, 
as above, advantage sets shall be played throughout. 

22. — ^The Committee may, whether appealed to by any 
Competitor or not, postpone the meeting or any match or part 
of a match if, in their opinion, the state of the weather, or 
of the light, or the condition of the ground, or other circum- 
stances, render it advisable to do so. In cases of postpone- 
ment. Law 25 must be strictly observed. 



C a s e a asid Decisions. 



By James Dwight, 

^'HE following Cases and Decisions are intended to meet 
Vk' questions often asked at Tournaments, and also to 
cover points apparently not provided for in the Laws. 

I. A player standing outside the court volleys the ball or 
catches it in his hand, and claims the stroke because the ball 
was certainly going out of court. 

Decision. — He loses the stroke. It makes no difference 
where he was standing. The return is presumed good until 
it strikes the ground outside of the court. 

II. A player is struck by the ball served before it has 
touched the ground, he being outside of the service court. 
How does it count? 

Decision. — The player struck loses the stroke. The 
service is presumably good until it strikes in the wrong court* 
A player cannot take the decision upon himself by stopping 
the ball. If it is going to be a fault, he has only to get out 
of the way. 

III. The service is delivered before the striker-out is 
ready. He tnes to return it and fails. Is he entitled to 
have it played over again? 

Decision. — No. If he attempts to return the service he 
is deemed ready. 

IV. The striker-out calls "Not ready," for a second 
service. The ball strikes beyond the service line, and the 



36 



Cabie» and Decisions 37 

striker&gt;ou'. claims that the fact that he was not ready makes 
no difference, since a fault cannot be returned, and, there* 
fore, that two faults have been served. 

Decision, — The second service goes for nothing. A 
player cannot call ** Not ready," and then have the service 
count, or not, as suits his interests. 

V. A ball having been played over the net bounds back 
into the court from which it came. The player reaches over 
the net and plays it before it falls. Has he a right to do so? 

Decision, — Yes, provided he does not touch the net. He 
has a right to play the ball at any time from the moment it 
crosses the net into his court until it touches the ground a 
second time. 

VI. A ball is played into the net; the player on the 
other side, thinking that the ball is coming over, strikes at it 
and hits the net. Who loses the stroke? 

Decision, — It is simply a question of fact for the umpire 
to decide. If the player touched the net while the ball was 
still in play he loses the stroke. 

VII Can a player follow a ball over the net with his 
racket, provided that he hits the ball on his own side of the 
net? 

Decision. — Yes, the only restrictions are that he shall not 
vcUey the ball until it has crossed the net, and that be shall 
not touch the net or any of its supports. 

VIII. A player's racket slips out of his hand and flies 
into the net. Does he lose the stroke for hitting the net? 

Decision, — Yes, if the ball be still in play. It does not 
matter if the racket be in a player's hand or not. 

IX. A player's racket leaves his hand, but meets tlie ba&amp; 
and returns it over the net. Is it a good return ? 

Decision, — Yes. There is no law requiring a racket to 



S8 Ciisia AMD DEcmaam 

be m a player's hand when the ball is returned. It woold 
unquestionably be a good return if the racket were held 
against the ground by a player's feet, and the ball bounded 
back off of it. 

X. A single match is played with a double net and mside 
posts. A player touches the net beyond the inside posts, 
and claims that he does not lose the stroke because there 
should be no net more than three feet outside of the court. 

Decision, — He loses the stroke. The net where he 
touches it is part of the supports of the net. He might, per- 
haps, have objected to the arrangement of the net before the ' 
match. 

XI. A player returns the ball, and, finding that he can- 
not stop himself before reaching the net, jumps over it. Is 
it a good return ? 

Decision. — Law 4 requires that " the players shall stand 
on opposite sides of the net," and therefore the player invad- 
ing his opponet's court loses the stroke. 

XII. A ball passes outside the post of the net and strike^ 
in court. Is it a good return. 

Decision, — Yes. 

XIII. A ball going out of court hits the top of the poit 
of the net and bounds into the opposite court 

Decision. — It is a good return. 

XIV. The service or the ball in play strikes a ball lying 
in the court. Can it be returned? 

Decision, — Yes, if it be clear to the umpire that the right 
ball is returned. 

XV. The server claims that the striker-out must stand in 
the court Is this necessary? 

Decision, — No. The striker-out can stand wherever bt 
please* on his own side of the net 



Cases and Decisions 39 

XVI. A bystander gets in the way of a player who fa3tH&gt; 
return the ball. May he then claim a let? 

Decision. — Yes, if, in the umpire's opinion, he was pre- 
vented by an accident beyond his control. For instance, if 
the ropes or the seats are allowed to be so near to the court 
that a player is interfered with by them, the stroke should 
not be played again, because the ropes and seats form part 
of the arrangements of the ground. If, however, a spectator 
passes in front of those seats, or places a chair nearer than 
the original line, and so interferes with a player, the stroke 
should be played again. 

XVII. A player is interfered with as above, and the um- 
pire directs the stroke to be played again. The server had 
previously served a fault. He claims the right to two 
services. 

Decision. — The fault stands. A let does not annul a 
previous fault. 

XVIII. A return hits the umpire, or his chair or stand* 
the player claims that the ball was going into court. 

Decision',, — Stroke is lost. 

XIX. A player receiving fifteen, serves frcm the left 
court. His opponent claims a fault. 

Decision. — It is a fault. The service starts from the 
right court under all circumstances. 

XX. At fifteen-all the server by mistake serves irom the 
left court, he wins the stroke and serves again (a fault), 
the mistake is then discovered. Is he entitled to the pre- 
vious stroke? From which court should he serve next? 

Decision, — The previous stroke stands. A fault cannot 
be claimed after the next service, good or not. is delivered. 
The next service should be from the left court, the score 
beinjC thirty-fifteen, and the server has served one fault. 



40 Caseb and Decisionb 

XXI. A player serves from the wrong court, he loses the 
stroke, and then claims that it was a fault 

Decision, — If Ibe stroke was played in his first service it 
is simply a fault, but if he serves twice into, the wrong court 
he has served two faults, and lost the stroke. 

XXII. The score is five games all, and the umpire di- 
rects the players to play an advantage set. The advantage 
game has been won, when it is discovered that no advantage 
sets are to be played. What is to be done? 

Decision, — The set is won at the* eleventh game. It is 
no part of the umpire's duty to decide on the conditions of 
the matches. 

XXIII. A player serves. He hears the umpire call, but 
cannot hear what he says. He knows that the only two 
things that the umpire should call are " fault" and ** let,'' 
and that in neither case can the ball be in play. He, there- 
fore, does not return it, only to find that the umpire has 
called " play." Has he any redress? 

Decision, — No. 

XXIV. The umpire calls « fault," and then instantly 
changes and says ** play." The striker-out fails to return the 
ball, and he claims he was prevented by the umpire, and 
also that the umpire cannot change his decision. 

Decision. — The umpire should call a let and the service 
be taken again. 

XXV. A ball drops near a line, the player appeals, and 
the umpire calb &lt;*play." The player misunderstands the 
call and lets the ball fall. He then claims to have the stroke 
played again. 

Decision. — The stroke stands. 

XXVI.— The ball strikes the ground close to a line th« 
scorer scores the stroke against the striker. On appeal to tlw 



Cases and Decisions. 41 

linesman, the latter decided that the ball was not ouu 
Which decision stands? 

Decision, — The scorer has no right to consider a ball out 
until the linesman has called to that effect, therefore, the 
decision of the latter must be accepted. The decision of a 
linesman affecting his own line is final. 

XXVII. A return strikes the cord running along the bot- 
tom of the net and bounds over. Is it a good return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII. During play a ball is thrown into court, and 
the ball in play strikes it or a player steps on it. May a let 
be claimed ? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX. The server's first service strikes his partner. 
Does he lose the stroke or is it a fault? 

Decision. — A fault. 

XXX. A player serves a fault and it is then discovered 
that it is his partner's service. Does the fault stand ? 

Decision, — Yes. 

XXXI. In a four-handed competition one player does 
not appear in time to play, and his partner claims to be 
allowed to play single-handed against the opposing pail 
May he do so? 

Decision, — No. 



THE SEASON OF 1908. 



PIE season has been a very interesting one, though its finish wa 
disappointing. 

It is needless to dwell on the increase of tournaments, etc. Neve 
in this CQuntry has lawn tennis been so popular. 

The Davis Cup matches have added a great deal to our own events 
Very early in the spring it was thought settM that an English team would 
come to this country to play the preliminary in Philadelphia, but after 
long delay it decided not to come. Later, just as we were planning to 
play England in Melbourne it was decided to send the team here and 
Longwood was selected as the place. 

The interest shown was a certain proof of the popularity of the game. 
For the Championship there were 149 entries, by far the largest number 
that there has ever been. The ranking committee has ranked more 
names than ever before. Everything goes to show the growth of the 
game. 

In looking over the country one finds that Lamed is unquestionably 
the best player we have. He played at Longwood and at Newport and 
against Parke and Ritchie. All these matches he won and with some- 
thing to spare. After him come Wright, Alexander, Clothier and Little 
in the East. In Chicago and the Middle West Emerson stands first 
In the South Thornton seems easily first. He won the Southern Cham- 
pionship, the Gulf States and Tennessee. He lost to Touchard in 
the Championship after a hard match. On Che Pacific Coast, Long 
seems to be first with McLaughlin a very close second. Then came 
Gardner and Bundy. It is possible to get a little better idea of the 
standards of play in the different parts of the country this year, than it 
has been before. For instance Long beat Johnson and Niles. Emer- 
son reached the Semi-Final at Newport, where he lost to B. C. Wright. 

Thornton is in about the same class as Touchard.

WILLIAM A. LARNED 
Champion of the United States 



NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. 



pORTUNATELY the weather at Newport was fine on Tue« 
* Wednesday, so that it was possible to reduce the enormou 
list to a reasonable size, before rain interrupted the play. 

There were seventeen matches in the First Round. Only on 
for mention, that between Little and Clothier. It was won by th« 
venr easily in three sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3. Little was not in his best f« 

instead of taking each round by itself, let us follow the course 
more interesting matches and of the better players. Alexander 
the upper quarter and little to do till he met Sulloway in the Sixth B 
to whom he lost the first set and nearly the second. That fas 
him into the Semi-Tinal. Below him Sulloway beat Hawk tlure 
to none, and LeRoy after losing the first two sets before he met Cki 
The next section was more close. Touchard beat Thornton, 6-4^ 
8-6, 12-10. Westfall beat Russ three sets to one. Touchard 
beat Westfall after a yery hard match played on the ChampioK 
Court, 6-8, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2, 7-5 He then met Clothier, who was too st 
for him and lost, 6-1, 8-6, 6-0. I. C. Wright beat Niles in the Set 
Round, 6-8, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5, and then lost to Clothier, who beat Am« 
the next round, and then Church, when he met Touchard. 

So much for the upper half. The best of the next 32 was £me4 
though he had to play four sets with Blair, four each with Colston, 1 
and Nettleton and fiye with Jones, which put him in the Semi-BJ 
against B. C. W^right. W. F. Johnson beat Palmer three sets to ^ 
then Cooke and lost to B. C. Wright The latter made his way a 
the Semi-Final without difficulty, his match in the round before bdl 
against Torrance, who had so far not lost a set 

In the Semi-Finals Alexander met Clothier in the upper half and B. • 
Wright met Emerson. 

Alexander won the first three games of the first set, and again i 
fifth, 4-1. Clothier won three in succession 4-all. Alexander maA 
it 5-4, but Clothier brought it to games-all. Alexander took the nei 
two games easily, playing extremely well. 

Clothier won the fijpst and second games, Alexander the next threl 
Clothier two, 4-3. Alexander reach^ 5-4 and 40 loye, but lost tib 
game. The next two games he again won easily, with a great streak a 
play. In the third set the games went with the sendee up to 4-all, thei 
Clothier lost his seryice and as Alexander won his, the latter took th&lt; 

' 6-4, a^d the match 3-0.

The Championship 45 

The score gives little idea of the match. Clothier plaved a very strong 
game, and a great deal of the time he played as well or better than 
Alexander, but when the critical times came Alexander seemed always 
able to let out a link and go ahead. 

The match between Wright and Emerson was closer than had been 
expected. Wright won the first set easily, but either he slowed up a 
Ut&amp;e or Emerson eame on, or probably a little of both, for Enierson 
won the second set 6-4 and reached 5-4 in the third set. It was his last 
effort and he lost the next three games and the set 7-5, and the fourth 
set 6-3, He played very well a^inst a strong player. 

The weather was too bad on Wednesday and Thursday for play. 

On Friday the conditions were fairly good, but it seemed as if tlie 
waiting had not suited Alexander. He was in nothing like the form that 
he showed against Little. Wright played very well, but the match was 
a disappointment The service won for four games and then Alexander 
got no more till the score was 5-2 against him, and then but one 6-3. 

The second set went easily to Wright, 2-0, ^-1, 4-2, 6-3. Alexander 
won the first and second games of me third set, but afterwards he 
was hardly in it, and again lost 6-3. 

The Championship was played in beautiful weather and there was a 
ve^ large gallery. 

Wright won the first game on his service to 15. Lamed won the three 
next games to 15, the fourth to love; the sixth after deuce had been 
called once and the last to 15. He passed Wright easily when he tried 
to come up or occasionally lobbed over his head. In the second set 
the play was more even for a time. Larned won the first game and 
Wright the second and tlurd, showing rather better form than in the 
first set, but he could get no farther and only one game reached deuce. 
The last set was really dose, but Lamed always seemed to have a little 
the advantage. Wright won two games and then Lamed three. Then 
each won his service till the score was 6-all; Lamed each time having 
won the vantage game. He won it again and then Wright's service, 8-6. 
At times the match was very brilliant, but at no time was Wright better 
than Lamed and most of the time much inferior. Thus ended the larg- 
est tournament that has been held for our Championship. Fortunately 
the weather was fine for the first four days, or it would have been im- 
possible to carry it through in any reasonable time. 




HAROLD H. HACKETT and FREDERICK B. ALEXANDER 

Champions in Doubles of the United States 



NATIONAL DOUBLES CHAMPIONSHIP. 

WRIGHT and Little had won tlie Eastern Doubles at Longwood and 
beaten the other winners at Bay Ridge, and now met the 
Champions of last year, Alexander and Hackett. There was some veiy 
pretty play, but the Champions were clearly a stronger team than their 
opponents. Hackett began serving and won a love game. Alexander 
and Hackett won the second and third games as well. In all of the 
sets Wright and Little did a good deal of lobbing and it was either 
short or went out. In the foiui;h game they played better and won it at 
deuce. The next three went to the Champions and the set 6-1, and 
29 strokes to 13. The second set was very different, being hard and 
evenly fought all the way through. It ran along with the service winning 
till the score was 3-all, when Wright and Little lost the service, 4-3; 
Hackett won his, 5-3. Wright and Little made it 5-4 and then won on 
Alexander's service, 5-all. Alexander took the vantage game almost 
wholly on his opponents errors, and then Hackett again won his service 
after deuce had been called three times. 

The third and last set needs little description. In the fourth game 
deuce was called once and the other five games Wright and Little won 
only four strokes. It was a very brilliant exhibition on the part of Alex- 
ander and Hackett. 

The Scores: 6-1, 7-5,^2^ 

THE DOUBLES CHAMPIONSHIP. 
East vs. West and West vs. South. 
npHE Double preHminary matches between the Eastern, Western 
■ and Southern Double teams to see who would prove the winner 
to play the National Champions, Hackett and Alexander at Newport 
the following week for the Clmmpionship of the country, took place 
on the fine grass courts of the Crescent Athletic Club, Bay Kidge, N. Y., 
August 13, 14 and 15. 

'Phe drawing brought the East vs. South match first, the winners 
to play the West. The results were as follows: 
East vs. South. 
Wright and Little (Ejist.) vs. Whitehead and Winston (South). Tlie 
matches proved rather ontv-sided. 'I'he latter seemed to be nervous 
and over anxious, which no doubt prevented them from playing their 
best game, while the former team played strong all-around tennis which 
gave them the match in three straight sets, 6-0, 6-3, 6-2. 
This brought the East and W^est pairs to face each other. 

East vs. West. 

The Western team proved themselves much stronger than the South 

though they were also defeated in three straight sets. They played good 

tennis and at times during the match put the Easterners to their liest 

game to defeat them, which they did by the following score, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4.

THE MATCHES FOR THE DAVIS CUP. 



AMERICA VS. BRITISH ISLES. 



WDOTH Englg,nd and America challenged Australia for the Cup. It 
- "-^ was finally agreed that the preliminary should be played at the 
Liongwood Cricket Club grounds, Boston, Mass., where two fine grass 
courts were prepared for the event The American team consisted of 
Alexander, Hackett, Lamed and Wright. It was known at the time 
that only Alexander and Wright could go to Australia, but as the regu- 
lations allow the use of different teams for the different sets of matches, it 
seemed wise to name the full strength of the country. 

The play began on Thursday, September 17 at Longwood with the 
match between Lamed and Parke. There had been some disappoint- 
ment, when the British team was named, as neither of the Dohertys or 
Smith were on it, but the result showed that this country needed its best 
men to win. 

Lamed vs. Parke. 

Parke is very tall, strong and active. His service has little or no twist, 
but it is fast and well placed, and not easy to do much with. He seems 
to prefer the back of the court, and to be better on his passing strokes 
backhanded than " forehanded. He also can smash a short lob as it 
should be done. At times he was unsteady, but at other times his 
strokes across court were beautifully exact, and extremely fast. He lost 
because he was not quite as good as Lamed. 

Lamed on his part played the match with great judgment. He found 
soon that he was the better and could win without taking too much risk 
in nmning up, and he was contented to go along slowly and to take no 
chances. Occasionally,, as in the last part of the third set he would 
suddenly begin playing a much faster game, and when he did so, he 
won easily.

Wright vs. Ritchie. 

In the meantime the other Singles Match was going quite the other 
way. Wright was in very poor form and though he carried the first 
game to deuce and won the second, Ritchie ran out the set 6-1, in a 
very few minutes. He played for the mast part in the back of the court 
and kept a good length and good direction. 

The second set looked more hopeful for a time. Wright won the 
first game to love, lost the second after deuce had been called onoe, 
won the third, and after losing the next two, brought the score even at 
3-all. He made but four strokes in the rest of the set In the third set 
Ritchie lost the first and third games, but won the set 6-£. Wright 
worked very hard to save the match at Uie end, but he was too uncertain 
to hold his own against Ritchie's steadiness. Thus the first day aided 
with the score even, each country winning a match.

Friday was again a beautiful day and there was a larger gallery than 
on Thursday, about 2,500 people being present. They saw a match 
such as is seldom seen in its wonderful brilliancy and imcertainly. 
Against so good a pair as Alexander and Hackett Ritchie's careful, 
well-placed strokes are not so effective as in Singles. Parke, on the other 
hand, showed a game for which he had not been given credit His 
speed and placing and his ability to get anything and to return it not 
only fast but well-placed, showed how great a double player he would be, 
if he and his partner had played enough together to make such an accu- 
rately working machine as Alexander and Hackett.

Lamed vs. Ritchie. 

The weather on the last day was again very fine, and the conditions 
good for play. Lamed started very badly, apparently being nervous. 
Occasionally he made a fine stroke, but in most cases the ball went out 
or into the net. In this way five games went to Ritchie who was playing 
steadily and well, but who was not pressed to any great extent. With 
Ihe score five love against him Lamed started playing in earnest. He 
brought the score to 4-5, but" he lost the next game and the set 6-4. 
However, he had not got going and though he lost the first game of the 
second set, he took the next with the loss of three strokes only. Ritchie 
won the fifth game to love and the seventh at deuce, but Lamed won 
the others, only one going to deuce and the second set 6-3. He ran out 
the third set very fast. He lost the fifth and sixth games, but of the 
others only one reached deuce. Ritchie's game did not seem to have 
fallen off, but Lamed was clearly the stronger. The fourth set started 
with four long games, three of which Ritchie took. Lamed won the 
next after deuce had been called twice, and then ran the set out with 
the loss of but four points. After learned once got going he was un- 
mistakably the stronger player of the two. Ritchie played a good, 
steady game and the result was no reflection on his play.

International Cup Matches op 1908 71 

Wright vs. Packe. 

This match is harder to describe properly for the play varied from 
very good to very poor. The first set ran evenly to S-alfand then Wright 
won two games 5-3, one at deuce and one to love. * Parke won the next 
two, losing only one stroke, 5-all. Then the advantage game went twice 
to Wright and once to Parke, and at 8-all Parke quite out-played Wright 
and won both the next games at love. The second set was shorter. 
Parke won the first two games, lost the third and fourth won the fifth and 
sixth. Then Wright won his last game in the set to 30 as Parke took 
the last two; one being at deuce, two sets love. The third set was 2- 
all and 4-2 for Parke. The next game Wright won at deuce and fol- 
lowed it with three more in which Parke got only three points. The 
fourth set was the deciding one of the matdi. Wright won the second, 
third and fourth games abo the sixth 4-2. Parke made a great effort 
and won three games one to 30 and two to 15; 5-4 for Parke. Wright 
rose to the occasion and ran the set out It was Parke's last real suc- 
cess, though he won the third and sixth games of the fifth set. Wright 
deserves credit for pulling out the match when it seemed to be lost.

72 International Cup Matches op 1908 

AMERICA VS. AUSTRALASIA DAVIS CUP MATCHES. 

On October 9 Wright (Captain) and Alexander sailed from Van- 
couver for Sydney, .N. S. W. The trip was a long one and the players 
took moderate exercise such as throwing the medicine ball, cricket 
and skipping rope. On their arrival at Brisbane, Sydney, and Mel- 
bourne, they were met by the various tennis committees and given a 
royal welcome. At both Brisbane and Sydney they were urged to stop 
over and play, but as there was only a short time to get into condition, 
th^ began training at once in Melbourne. 

The Warehouseman grounds where the matches were to be played 
were not quite in readiness, so for the first ten days private courts 
were put at their disposal and the leading Australian and American 
flayers had many good Single and Double practice matches together. 
Brookes practiced on his own private court with Wilding who was 
living wim him. 

The Victorian Championships began the week before the Internationals 
and all the leading players participated. Brookes and Wright defaulted, 
Wright the day before he met Wilding as he thought it best to put all 
the strain on the Final contest Alexander, however, played through, 
meeting and losing to Wilding in the Finals. In the Doubles both 
International pairs met, Brookes and Wilding winning. 

Summer was fast approaching as it does in South Australia and the 
temperature would range from 135 degrees to 150 degrees in the sun, 
consequently the players had to be careful and not overdo. The matches 
were scheduled for the 26th, 27th and 28th of November, but the first 
day it rained. 

Alexander vs. Brookes. 

The 27th was a beautiful day, and when Brookes and Alexander 
walked on the court at 2 p. m. the three stands and dub house porch 
were crowded with enthusiastic Australians, although there were a few 
Americans who were most loyaL 

Alexander lost the first four games by being erratic, but soon settled 
down and only allowed Brookes one more game that set which was a 
great surprise not only to the world's Champion but to dose followers 
of the game. Both players were winning on tneir favorite shots, Brookes 
on his service and slmrp volleying, and Alexander by his beautiful 
ground strokes and smasning. Not until 7-all was called did Brookes 
break through winning by ^7. In the third set Alexander continued 
with the same brilliancy, but Brookes missed several easy volleys and 
only got two games losmg 6-2. With two sets to one in nis favor and 
winning the last set so easily, it seemed as though Alexander would 
win, but he lost his aggressiveness, while Brookes began to force matters 
and won the last two sets though not easily as 3-all was called in the fifth.

Wright vs. Wilding. 

Shortly after four Wright and Wilding came on the court After 
winning the Victorian Championship, Wilding's stock went up and he 
looked like a sure winner taking the first set, 6-3. On the otner hand ' 
Wright was taking things easily and working Wilding on short ones 
when back, low ones when he ran in, mixed with many lobs. This 
told on Wilding as he lost his sting, thus allowing Wright to be the aggres- 
sor on all occasions winning the last 3 sets, 7-5, 6-3, 6-1. In Uie Le^t set 
Wilding played almost entirely a back court game.

THE DOUBLES. 
Wright and Alexander vs. Brookes and Wilding. 

The splendid weather conditions still prevailed and on Saturday 
afternoon when the Doubles started, every possible seat was occupied 
and many people were refused admittance. 

The four players entered at the same time and the gallery stood up 
and cheereci. This naturally enthused the players, although they 
realized this match would, without doubt, decide the eptire contest. 
There was no choice between the teams as all four had reputations as 
Doubles players. Brookes and Wilding having won the All England 
Championship the previous year and Alexander and Wright both being 
U. S. National Champions, Alexander for two years with Hackett (and 
present Champions) and Wrio^ht for three years undefeated with Ward, 
rassed records and general opinion proved true as Brooks and Wilding 
won, but only after a hard and exciting 5-set match. Both sides were 
aggressive, and it was a battle to work through the service. Wilding 
was steady all through, but not brilliant. He seldom failed to return 
the service close to the net thus making it hard to volley. Brookes 
served and volleyed well as usual, was weak on his back-hand, but pro- 
tected this by running around the ball. He fell off badly in the fourth 
set, but came back brilliantly in the fifth, and saved the day. Wright 
served strongly and led on aces. His smashing was deadly and his 
ground strokes sure, but not brilliant. He played poorest in the third 
set. Alexander was brilliant all through. His smashing was better 
than any of the others, but he never lobbed thus allowing his opponents 
to phy close to the net. Excitement was intense and applause plentiful 
until tne Americans led 2-0 in Uie final set and their service, then there 
came a lull. It looked like a victory and the Cup, but unfortunately 
Alexander lost his service twice in the last set and the match was won by 
Australasia, 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 1-6, 6-4.

International Dinner. 

The International dinner was planned for Saturday night and could 
not be postponed. It was a great success as over fifty sat down. Many 
speeches were made and the Americans were presented with most at- 
tractive opal pins, the Australian emblem, while the Americans presented 
Mr. Chomley, the referee, with a silver case. Many speeches were noade 
and each speaker remarked that it was greatly appreciated by all that 
America sent a team such a distance to Iryand regain the Ciip. They 
also remarked about the American's sportsmanship. Sunday-was spent 
quietly as all the players were glad for the rest. 

Wright vs. Brookes. 

The first match Monday was the Brookes vs. Wright contest, and it 
was a contest. The players had met on three previous occasions, WVight 
winning twice in a five-set match in the London Championships and 
in a four-set match in the International a week after. Wright was at 
top form and the same year he won the U. S. Championship. Two years 
later, however, Brookes won three straight winning the Lnglish Cham- 
pionship the same year. 

The stands were packed when the players entered the court at two'' 
o'clock, and were heartily cheered. At the time the temperature was 
145° in the dazzling sun. Brookes wore a hat the entire match, while 
Wright went bare headed. 

Brookes started off brilliantly getting many aces on first services, 
and after receiving Wright's service would follow it in, and a battle at 
the net would follow, Brookes usually winning. At four love Wright 
saw that there was little chance of winning the set, and if he did in such 



International Cup Matches of 1908 79 

heat he would have but little left for the balance of the match, so very 
wisely he lobbed as he did to Wilding, but did not play any short ones 
as Brookes volleyed too well. Brookes won the next two games and 
set six love, but the tossing made them long ones and took some of his 
snap away. Wright continued these tactics until finally Brookes gave 
up following in on Wright's service. It was here the match changed 
and the players were on an even footing. It was a match of skill with the 
racket, headwork and endurance. Brookes won the second set 6-3, 
and after exchanging services until 4rall was called and Brookes had 
40-30 with his service next, it looked as though the match was over and 
the Cup lost. Wright won the game by three brilliant shots and allowed 
Brookes but one more game, winning 7-5. There was not enough 
time to change flannels between the sets as the Australian rules only 
allow three minutes, so the players took advantage of this precious time 
by baUiing their heads with cold wet towels, whidi was most refreshing. 
Two sets to one for Brookes sounded like a safe lead, but Wright's 
tactics in the early part of the match caused Brookes to lose his severe 
service and forcing tactics, and in the foiuiJi set Wright simply took all 
chances and rushed matters winning 6-2, making but few errors. This 
continued until Wright was 4-1, when Brookes revived and the score was 
called 4-all amid cheers. 

A battle of services and the survival of the fittest followed. Both 
players were working mechanically, the real tennis had gone. They 
could only reach the middle of the court to volley and the spectators to 
both players seemed to be a blur. Brookes had 7-6, 8-7 ana 10-9, when 
Wrignt put a most determined look on his face and won the last three 
games 12 points to 6. The onlookers yelled bravo to both players imtil 
* they reached the clubhouse after a match that lasted two hours and 
forty minutes.

Wilding vs. Alexander. 

When W^ildinf? and Alexander went into the court it was ten minutes 
to five, and another lon&lt;y match would have caused a play-off the fol- 
lowing day as both captains agreed to stop play each at six. 

Both plavers appeared to be a trifle nervous as was only natural with 
the future nome of the Cup depending on this match. After the pre- 
liminary warminor up, Wilding began serring and won the game, also 
the next two. This gave Wilding a commanding lead which he held 
until the end winning by 3 sets to love and without losing a single service 
game. Alexander could not seem to get started, while Wilding took 
all chances making but few mistakes and being very aggressive. After 
the match he was carried off the court on the shoulders of his friends. 

The Americans received every possible courtesy during their visit, 
and the committee did all in their power to assist the challengers. The 
court was in perfect condition, an&lt;l great pains were taken in selecting 
the linesmen who were mostly leading players. It is only hoped that 
America will be able to send another team to Australia this year. It 
can be truly said that they play the game' for sport's sake.

THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. 



I HE National Championship for Women's Singles and Doubles and 
* Mixed Doubles was again held at AA'issahickon, the home of the 
Philadelphia Cricket Club, w^here all of these historic events have been 
held since the inception of National Championships for the fair sex. 
A record-breaking entry list both in size and quality greeted the onlookers 
and made the hard-working committee hustle to get everything nm off 
on time. 

A successful innovation was the playing of matches in the mornings 
as well as the afternoons and the change seemed to be acceptable to all 
concerned^ 

The severe heat was responsible for tw^o or three defaults in the First 
Round and also accounts for the retirement of Miss Kutroff, who after 
a hard set with Miss Johnson of the Merion Cricket Club of Philadelphia, 
which Miss Johnson won 7-5, succumbed to the heat and h«ad to retire 
after the first two games of the second set had been played. 

One noteworthy match in the First Round was the defeat of Miss C. T. 
Chase, a former Pennsylvania State Champion, by Miss Matilda Borden 
of .the home club.. The balance of the matclies in the First Round were 
won without much difficulty by the favorites. 

Miss Borden in the Second Round defeated Miss Curtis of Boston, 2-6, 
6-3, 6-3. 

Mrs. Pouch, who as Miss Helwig, won the National Championship 
some few years ago, defeated Miss Ema Marcus quite easily by the 
score of 6-3, 6-1. Mrs. Barger-Wallach played her usulal steady game, 
defeating Miss C. Scott, the Chami)ion of the Country Club, West 
Chester (N. Y.), in straight sets. 

Getting down" to the Third Round, Miss Borden, the local player, kept 
up her wonderfully good work and in straight sets defeated Mrs. A. G. 
Miles. 

The Third Round was productive of good tennis all through and 
brought together in the Fourtli Round Miss Rotch who defeated Mrs. 
Pouch after a hard match. 

JVIrs. Barger-Wallach caused the downfall of the local player, de- 
feating Miss Borden, 6-3, 6-2. This being really the first time that Miss 
Borden had gone through such an imporUmt tournament, the strain 
naturally told on her, and it speaks well tliat the game is producing such 
a good quality of players who j)romisc to make strong bids for the Cham- 
pionship in me future. 

Miss Johnson of Staten Island defeated Miss Cohen of Philadelphia 
and Miss W^agner caused the downfall of Miss Necly of Chicago. This 

83 



84 Women's National Championship 

was an excellent match, each winning a set 6-4 and 5-all, being called 
in the final set when Miss Wagner's steady and accurate play won the 
remaining two ^mes giving her the set, 7-5. 

In the Semi5'inal Round Mrs. Barger-Wallach, still playing her 
steady game from the base-line, relying almost entirely on her ability 
to place the ball, defeated Miss Rotch, 6-2, 6-4. The score, however, 
does not indicate the closeness of the match. 

Miss Wagner accounted for Miss Johnson. 

The Final Match brought together Mrs. Barger-Wallach and Miss 
Wagner, opponents of entirely different styles of tennis, created a great 
deal of interest. Miss Wagner's forcing tactics won her the first set 
6-4, but nothing daunted, Mrs. Wallach came back strong in the second 
set, winning handily by the score 6-1, and then app»arently stronger in 
the last set run out the game 6-3, giving her the priwlege of challenging 
Miss Evelyn Sears. 

The Championship Round was played in front of the grand stand 
before a large crowd of enthusiastic spectators. Both players clung to 
the base-line game, rarely attempting to go to the net and they both 
relied on their placing and not on their service, and the rallies were long 
and sustained, the ball frequently going over the net in single rallies 
15 to 20 times. 

The first set went to Mrs. Barger-Wallach, score 6-3, and the second 
was nip and tuck until 5-all was called, when Miss Sears ran out the 
necessary two games obtaining the set. After the usual rest the third and 
final set was started and some long sustained rallies were evidenced, 
and the score crept to 5-all, 6-all, 7-all, until the wonderfully ac- 
curate placing of Mrs. Wallach began to tell and she ran out the two 
remaining games, winning the matc£ and Championship, 9-7. 

The Ladies' Doubles brought together in the Final Round Miss 
Sears and Miss Curtis of Boston who defeated Miss Neely and Miss 
Steever of Chicago, 6-3, 5-7, 9-7. The match was marked by fast tennis 
with close net work on the part of the Western pair and the smashes 
and cross court shots added greatly to the interest and gameness of the 
contest 

Miss Rotch paired with Niles in the Final Round of the Mixed 
Doubles and defeated Miss Hammond and Little, the National 
player. Niles' curious twist service was used with deadly ^ect, and 
both of the men displayed great ability in their hard smashing and 
lobbying. 

In the Men's Singles Beals Wright won, defeating Dr. Dewhurst, 
5-7, 6-2, 3-6, 8-6, 6-3. 

Taking all together the tournament was the most successful of all the 
National tournaments held, and the sustained interest shown not only 
by the contestants, but by the spectators indicates a more marked activity 
in the game among the fair sex than ever before. 

The tournament was ably handled by Mr. Patton as chairman, who 




MRS. BARGER-WALLACH 

Lady Champion of the United States 



86 Women's National Championship 

was most energetic and worked hard for the interests of all concerned. 

One of the features not mentioned before was the fact that the rooms 
of the Chestnut Hill Academy, formerly the Wissahickon Inn, were 
secured for the players, which proved a great convenience as the building 
is practically at the entrance of the Philadelphia Cricket Club groimds.

cidedly strong contestants for the title, including Cowan Rodgers of 
Knoxville, Whitehead and Winston of Norfolk, Grant and C. Y. Smith 
of Atlanta. 

After many exciting matches being played the honor fell to Hugh 
Whitehead to meet the Champion, Nat Thornton, for the Challenge 
Match. Keen interest in the result brought out a gallery of several 
hundred people, and while local sentiment was strongly for the Atkmta 
player to win. Whitehead had also a host of friends and shared equally 
in the applause from the grand stand. Thornton was quick to take ad- 
vantage of the fact that Whitehead played a back court game, relying 
upon his accuracy in pass-shots; so Inomton took the net from the start. 
There for two sets he played remarkably good tennis, covering the court 
completelv, and displaying a variety in returns, cross-courting, base- 
line smasnes and short strokes, which bewildered his opponent, and won 
for him the first two sets at 6-2, 6-1. By this time Wnitdiead realized 
the situation was desperate and went strongly for the next set, winning 
it at 6-3, and looked to have a good chance for the fourth set also. But 
with the score five-all, he lost his service and Thornton, by winning his 
own took the deciding game and match, thereby becoming for the second 
year Champion of the South. 

The weatner for the week was ideal, clear and not too warm, and the 
toiunament passed without a hitch. For this great credit is due Referee 
Frank Reynolds, who gave constant attention to every detail of the meet.

SOUTHERN DOUBLES CHAMPIONSHIP. 



The U. S. N. L. T. A. Doubles Championship is played in three 
sections — Boston. Chicago and Atlanta. The latter was held July 6 
to 11 at the Atlanta Athletic Club and brought together twenty-jseven 
teams representing seven states. Much regret was felt that owing to 
the illness of Charles Rodgers, the Rodgers Brothers* team of Knoxville 
was broken up. But Cowan Rodgers and Farrell of Nashivlle teamed 
up» and for a time looked as if they might reach the Finals, but were 
disposed of in the Third Round by Whitehead and Winston. Carter 
ana Middlebrooks, Southern Intercollegiate Champions, were beaten 
in the same round by Sanders and McGinnis of New Orleans. The 
suprise of the tournament was in the strength of the two young players. 
Cowan and Van Gilder of Knoxville. Although it was their first real 
tournament experience, they reached the Semi-Finals without much 
trouble, defeating several very good teams, and being beaten by White- 
head and Winston in straight sets after a very pretty contest, losing the 
last set at 7-5. 

Smith and Howell of Atlanta, who had made a good showing for 
several years came out to the Finals without the loss of a set Here 
they met Winston and Whitehead, and after a rather brilliant start, and 
winning the first set at 6-4, proved unequal to the contest, and lost three 
sets at 0-6, 2-6, 3-6. 

This victory for Winston and Whitehead entitled them to diallenge 
Grant and Tnomton, two years Southern Champions, for the title, and 
the honor of representing the South in the National East-West-South 
tournament at tne Crescent Athletic Club in August. The weather for 
the matdi was ideal, and the interest among the tennis contingent in- 
tense. A pallery that overflowed the grand stands assembled early, and 
all indications were for a close, struggle. The Norfolk pair, however, 
took the upper hand from the start, Whitehead retummg everything 
with great steadiness, and Winston killing at every opportunity with 
sharp cross-courts or by bouncing the ball over the back stops. While 
Grant plajred with great steadiness and excellent judgment, Thornton 
had a decidedly off-day, driving the ball repeatedly into the net or just 
beyond the base line, and the spectators quickly saw how the match 
would end. In a very short time Winston and Whitehead had annexed 
the first and second sets at 6-2, 6-3; and after losing the third set at 4-6, 
won thhe fourth and deciding set at 6-4.

resented was keen. In the Final Round Miss Gertrude Jones of At-

little difficulty in getting a good lead, and was never overtaken, winning

termined stand, many of tne games being deuced a number of times, but

WHITE MOUNTAIN CHAMPIONSHIP. 



THE third annual tournament for the Championship of the White 
Moimtains, held on the courts of the Crawford House Tennis Club 
at Crawford Notch, New Hampshire, showed an improvement over 
previous events both in the number of entries and the quality of play 
of past seasons. The week was notable alike for good sport and good 
feUowidiip. 

Irving Wright was the star of the tournament, wresting the Challenge 
Cup from Russ, who had held it two years, and with Dabney for a 
partner, taking the Doubles trophies as well. In the Singles he dis- 
posed of F. W. Cole in the Fourth Roimd, Inman in the Semi-Finals and 
Jones in the Finals. Cole was the only one of the three to get a set, 
but Jones put up an exceedingly good game and each of the three sets 
required extra games. In these matches, as in the Challenge Round, 
Wright was too steady and too resourceful. He adapted himself easily 
to any style of play and was particularly good overhead. 

In Doubles Cole and Inman made a very good impression in their 
early matches and many picked them to win. In the Semi-Final Round 
they met Jones and Henshaw. With the score one set-all, play had 
to be stopped on account of darkness. The next day the match was 
replayed irom the start The Providence pair seemed to have guaged 
their opponents and won easily. 

Wright and Dabney came through to the Finals, defeating Page 
and Bra^ord in the First Round and Russ and Cresson, last year's 
winners, in the Second, both matches being in straight sets. Li the 
Finals they seemed to be off for one set, which they lost at 6-1. There- 
after their play was well-balanced and steady, the features being Wright's 
smashing and Dabney 's passing strokes.

LAWN TENNIS IN THE WEST. 



TENNIS IN AND ABOUT CHICAQO. 



T'^HE tennis season of 1908 was unquestionably marked by a raeat return 
* of public interest in the game throughout the West In Chicago 
this was made noticeable by the necessity of increasing the facilities for 
public play in the city's parks. In fact so great and insistent was this 
demand that the park boards finally met the popular demand by not 
only adding courts but also throwing open the grounds set apart for 
tennis for Sunday play — a distinct departure from the traditional policy 
of the park commissioners. In the clubs also the increase in interest 
was felt and in all of them the membership was fully up to the highest 
quoto allowed. The active play among the club members was an es- 
pecially pleasing feature and the club tournaments at all of the dubs 
invariably drew large entry lists. The open tournaments, however, 
failed to bring out play of unusual quaUty and much disappointment 
was felt in the non-appearance during the season of many of tne best of 
the Western players. Kreigh Collins was again out of the game and 
will probably never again participate in open events owing to his eye 
trouble; Heath Byford likewise failed to return to the game, while Ward 
C. Burton, the Minneapolis star, was kept out owing to illness. James 
J. Forstall was away in Europe and Rueben G. Hunt failed to come East 
for the Western season. Carr Neelalso disappointed his Chi^^o ad- 
mirers by allowing his titles, won in 1907, to go by default. Tne ab- 
sence of these men therefore made the tournaments seem unusually 
dull, although all of the veterans and many of the younger players 
improved. 

Of the women the absence of many good players was keenly felt and 
interest in their events consequently fell off sadly. Mrs. Robert Wil- 
liams, the brilliant winner of the Illinois and Western tournaments of 
1907, removed to Boston and was lost to the game owing to family cares. 
So slack was the interest among the women players in fact that the 
W^estem tournaments excepting Singles were declared off and social 
events, without fee, substituted in order to take care of the few women 
that responded to the call for entries.

J. ALLEN ROSS 
Western Intercollegiate Champion

THE WESTERN INTERCOLLEGIATE AND INTERSCHOLASTIC 
TOURNAMENTS. 



• The first tournaments of importance in the West were the Western 
Intercollegiate and Western Interscholastic tournaments, which were 
played on the courts of the University of Chicago. The first of these 
was played on June 15 and following days. It drew entries from nearly 
all of the leading Western universities and was well attended. The 
courts are ideally situated and are among the finest clay courts in the 
West, the play being, consequentljr of a high order. In both the Singles 
and Doubles events the University of Chicago carried off first honors, 
thus scoring the two points necessary to secure for that institution per- 
manent possession of the trophy. In the Singles J. Allen Ross, the 
former National Interscholastic Champion, made his first appearance in 
intercollegiate company and won the title fairly easily, defeating Muir 
of Minnesota in the Fmal Round, 6-1, 6-4, 10-8, while Ross and Hart 
of Chicago took first place in the Doubles. 



WESTERN INTERSCHOLASTIC CHAMPIONSHIP. 



In the Western Interscholastic Championship held immediately after 
the intercollegiate event, the honors were taken in the Singles by R. 
Shields, representing the Calumet High School, who defeated Byford 
of the University High School after a hard five-set match (6-3, 6-1, 3-6, 
4-6, 6-1) in the Final Round. In the Doubles the Evanston Academy 
represented by K. Bragg and Foster came out victorious. The field was 
unusually large and classy and nearly all of the leading "prep*' schools 
were represented. 

THE OPEN TOURNAMENTS. 



Of the open tournaments only two of importance were played in 
Chicago last year — ^the Illinois and Western Championships, The 
Wanderers Cricket and Athletic Club held its usual open event scheduled, 
but it is said that friction between the tennis and cricket enthusiasts was 
responsible for its cancellation. So that with this event removed there 
remained but two open tournaments in the Chicago district In the 
place of the Wanderers' tournament, however, the Onwentsia Club of 
Lake Forest filled in bv scheduUng a Round Robin Invitation Doubles 
event which was played during the week prior to the Western and re- 
sulted in some interesting matches, and won by H. L. Waidner and J. C. 
^eely.

THE SEASON IN THE CHICAGO TENNIS LEAGUE. 



Among the clubs themselves the chief interest of the season centered 
in the play in the Chicago Tennis League. Five clubs competed in 
the league matches last year — six men in the Singles and three teams in 
the Doubles representing each of the dubs in each of the matches. 
The schedule was well arranged and large galleries turned out to see the 
oon tests. The method of counting was altered slightly, each match won 
scoring one point in favor of the victorious dub, where heretofore the 
entire team match was counted as a win or a loss. It was believed that 
this would discourage the defaulting of individual matches and the 
scheme worked out well and will be followed again the coming season. 
The fight in the league was especially severe among the three leading 
clubs and resolved itself into a three-cornered contest between the Ken- 
wood, Aztec and University of Chicago Clubs.

WESTERN CHAMPIONSHIP 



The twenty-first annual Western Championshij&gt; was decided on the 
courts of the Kenwood Country Club of Chicago during the week 
of July 25 under the most favorable conditions, excepting for the oppres- 
sive heat which at times bothered the players. In this event L. Harry 
Waidner ran through the field in the Smgles quite easily, where he met 
Charles S. Peters in the Final Round Peters started out well and took 
the first set, but Waidner came back strong and took the next three in 
succession, winning the match, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. In the Challenge 
Hound Waidner faced Nat Emerson, the holder of the title, and here 
once more history repeated when after the most gruelling, exciting 
match ever seen on a Western court the Cincinnatian was returned the 
wimier, 8-10, 6-0, 3-6, 6-1, 7-5. Several times Waidner had this match 
within a point, the ball "letting'* at one crucial period and saving the 
noatch for Emerson. 

In the Men's Doubles Waidner and Emerson, paired together, won 
out hands down defeating Hayes and Peters by default in the Final Round 
through an unfortimate condition of affairs that prevented the playing 
of the match. 

In the Women's Singles the title was retained by Miss Carrie B. Neely, 
who defeated Miss Miriam Steever (challenger) after one of their famous 
long-drawn out matches — ^the final score being, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. The 
Women's Doubles was won by Miss Neely and Mrs. Barnes, and the 
Mixed Doubles by Miss Steever and Mr. Kicker.

NATIONAL DOUBLES PRELIMINARY. 



With the awarding of the Western Championships to the Onwentsia 
Club for 1909, together with the awarding to the same club of the Pre- 
liminary Round-Robin Doubles, for the right of challenging for the 
National Doubles title at Newport, the season of 1909 is eagerly looked 
forward to in the West and in Chicago especially, and it is thought that 
the game will sustain an even greater boom in popular interest during 
the coming season, as the Western Association has announced its inten- 
tion^ of sparing no means to secure for Chicaf^o the best players from all 
sections of the country. The Preliminary Doubles will be especially 
welcomed to Chicago this year, which will be the first since 1893 that 
the Western enthusiasts have had the opportunity of witnessing an event 
of national importance.

MEXICO CITY TOURNAMENT. 



nr%[E first open lawn tennis tournament for the Championship of the 
^ Republic of Mexico took place April 11 and followmg days on the 
dirt courts of the Mexico Country Club. There was quite an interest 
in the tournament owing to a gooci entry list of visiting ptayers, including 
Claresice Hobart, Irving Wright, George Wagner, Semp Kuss, Chiu*les 
Cresson, A. V. Duncan and a number of Texas pWers who made the 
trip in a special car in charge of the president of the Texas Lawn Tennis 
Association, E. L. Scott 

The playing of the visitors was not up to their reputation owing prin- 
cipally to the bright light which takes time to become accustomed to. 

The playing of Claude Butlin, winner of the Singles, and Harvey and 
Paul MacQuiston (of Mexico City), winners of the Doubles, was very 
strong, they outplaying the visitors all through the tournament. 

Large crowds were present during the week, much interest being shown 
in the different matches, particularly the Finals in Singles and Doubles. 

The tournament was a grand success and the visiting players returned 
home much pleased with the kind treatment they received at the hands 
of the tennis committee and the members of the Country and Univer-

defeating Pittsburg Field Club in their match on the Field Club team*s 
pounds. Beside the Club Championship, Edgewood has the Junior 
Champion, D. W. Lloyd, who won in a field of thirty-two placers, all 
19 years of age or less; the strongest Double team in the association is 
I&gt;r. T. W. Stephens and P. O. Naly; this team was also runner-up in 
the Western Pennsylvania Doubles Championship; Sunstein, the former 
Princeton man, was runner-up in Singles Championship of Western 
Pennsylvania. 

The Pittsburg Field Club finished second, losing only one match, 
that to the Edgewood Club, Brighton has the Champion of the Novices 
in C. K. Robinson. Shadyside and Electric Clubs finished in the order 
named, the former team being a disappointment, their stars being un- 
able to carry the team to the top. 

The tournaments held by the association were well attended and had 
more entries than ever before, there being 228 in all. Miss Marion 
Aiken won the Women's Singles; Mrs. T. K. Laughlin and Greorge 
D. Edw^ards, the Mixed Doubles; Percy Siverd and C. L. Childs, the 
Men's Doubles and H. J. Kendall the Men's Singles. Kendall had no 
trouble at all in cleaning up the best players that went against him; 
Champion Childs, the Western Pennsylvania tournament winner did 
not play well all week, and those who watched the play closely were not 
surprised at the result. Kendall defeated lams, Siverd, Sunstein and

CHAMPIONSHIPS OF PACIFIC NORTHWEST. 



'T'HE eighteenth annual tournament for the Championships of the 
■ Pacific Northwest was held as usual by the Tacoma Lawn Tennis 
Club, Washington August 3 to 8, at Tacoma, "Washington. ^ The entey 
list was as usual quite representative, all the strong players in the juris- 
&lt;iiction being present, with but two exceptions, McBumey of Spokane 
and Schwengers of Victoria. California was represented by Miss Hazel 
notchkiss, Lou R. Freeman, and E. Jordan. The Doubles event was 
exceptionally interesting, and in fact, the only Doubles contest in the 
Pacific Northwest last season. At all the other tournaments the strong 
pairs were so broken up that one pair always had a walk awav. At 
Tacoma there were four pairs in the running: Freeman and Walter A. 
Ooss of Portland, who won the tournament; S. L. Russell and Joe C. 
Tyler, the famous Seattle pair; Payne and Armstrong of Taconia, the 
International Champions, and Jordan and Breeze. In the Singles, 
Freeman beat Tyler in straight sets, from the back court Jordan de- 
feated Gross rather easily, but was defeated by Payne. In the Finals 
Freeman took the first set, 7-5, and Payne the second set, 6-4, when 
Freeman retired Freeman's Singles game is not what it used to be. 
Apparently his health is not the best, and he refuses to run to the net as 
he invariably used to do. 

Miss Hotchkiss had things all her own way in the Ladies' Singles 
and Doubles, but tasted defeat in the Mixed Doubles, the first and only 
time in her Northern trip.

Smith of Dartmouth proved to be the proverbial dark horse, and de- 
feated Thompson in tne Semi-Finals and his team mate, L. F. Stem of 
Dartmouth, m the Finals with ease, not being forced to go a deuce set 
in either case.

LAWN TENNIS IN CALIFORNIA. 



PACIFIC STATES CHAMPIONSHIP. 



TpHE Pacific States Championship of 1908 commencing the week of 

* September 7 and ending the following week (19th) proved to be 
extra attractive to the lawn tennis players of California owing to the 
visit of the three Eastern players, Irvmg Wright, Nat Niles and Wallace 
Johnson. 

The tournament was held on the asphalt courts at Del Monte. No 
better place for a tournament could be selected as the hotel and surroimd- 
ings are most inviting and fine for a week's outing. 

All the events were successfully run off; many well-played and hard- 
fought matches were contested during the tournament both in Singles 
and Doubles. The Eastern visitors had to battle hard to get as far in 
the tournament as they did, finding the pace set for them by the Califor- 
nia players rather fast as the courts caused quick bounds to the ball and 
somewhat of a different game than is played on grass or dirt, but not 
enough difference to interfere with Eastern players' game. The all 
round play of Long, McLoughUn, Grardner, Bundy and Janes was of 
the best, jjarticularly the two former. 

The ladies are all strong players, those in particular are the Misses 
Sutton, Mrs. Farquhar (formerly Miss Jones and twice a National 
Champion), Misses Hotchkiss, Ryan and Myer. 

The junior players of which there are a number, are most promising 
for the future of the game in California. The two who played in the 
Finals of the Junior department, Robert Strachan and Charles Rogers, 
played the different strokes in good form and used judgment in placing 
the ball. 

The treatment the Eastern men received at the hands of the tourna- 
ment committee and the players was most pleasant and everything 
was done to make their visit a most enjoyable one.

LAWN TENNIS IN SAN FRANCISCO 



Tennis in and around San Francisco has seen a very successful 
season in the year of 1908. It is safe to say that there are more 
devo ees tnan ever before in this vicinity. More clubs are being organ- 
ized^^anta Rosa, Berkeley and Oakland being three very large and 
active tennis organizations started since the first of the year. Golden 
Gate Park is a great tennis center now and all of the best players in 
the city and from about the bay take part in tournaments held on its 
courts. The visit of he Eastern team, Irving Wright, Nat. Niles and 
W. F. Johnson to our Del Monte event has given a great impetus to 
the game and the season of 1909 will be a busy one.

The San Francisco Championship 

Was held during the latter part of May on the courts of the California 
Lawn Tennis Club and although the entry list was small, it included 
all of the best players in the city. M. McLoughlin successfully defended 
his title and obtained his second win on the beautiful Grant trophy, 
which must be won three times. This trophy was won in 1903 by 
J. D. McGavin, 1904 by C. P. Muidock, 1905 by C. R. Gardner, 1906 
by Charles Foley, 1907 by M. E. McLoughlin and once again in 1908 
by the same man. 

G. Janes won from Charles Foley in a hard three-set match, but fell 
before Long's onslaught. This match was also a close one, however, 
and Long was forced to his utmost to take the measure of the little man. 
The score was 3-6. 6-2, 6-4. In the Semi-Finals of the other half C. 
Gardner defeated H. Long in a tremendous three-set match which went 
to fifty games before he was declared the victor. ^ 

M. Long put up a^great game in the Finals with Gardner. He put 
the finishing touches to that which his brother had started in the morn- 
ing and won almost as he pleased. 

The Challenge match was a dandy. Long started off at a great 
pace and was never headed in the first two sets. Notwithstanding, the 

games were all close and the plajdng brilliant McLoughlin seemed a 
it nervous and failed to assume the net as regularly as is his custom, 
lliis may partly have been due to the fact that Long often and more 
than often passed him down the sides and with cross court shots. At 
the beginning of the third set it looked as if Long would surely win, 
but he became careless. McLoughlin, quick to see his advantage, soon 
regained his confidence and changed his tactics. Having won me third 
set 6-3 he came through with a wonderful burst of speed in the fourth 
and dropped but one game. Long had lost his assurance and failed 
to play the same brand of tennis that had characterized his previous 
^lay and in the last set he did well to get the three games which Mc- 
'ighlin dropped in winning the set and match. Swre, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 
6-3.

DEAN MATHEY 

National Int^rscholastic Champion

average and the doseness of many of the most important matches kept 
the spectators in a state of expectation and excitement as was evidenced 
by a constantly increasing attendance resulting in a record-breaking 
grand stand on the last altemoon. 

Open Singles. 

There were forty^ix entries in the Open Singles, the most prominent 
of which were A. E. Bell, Southern California Chanq&gt;ion in 1901, 1902 
and 1903, Eugene Overton, Southern Cahfomia Champion in 1904 and 
1905, T. C. Bundy, winner of the Colorado, Long Beach and Venice 
tournaments this year, Charles Rogers, Interscholastic Champicm of 
Southern California. At the outset the wiseacres predicted tnat the 
winner would be returned from among Bundy, Bell, Overton, Browne, 
Sinsabaugh and Wayne, with Bundy and Bell having the best chances. 

This forecast proved to be a good one as Bundy defeated Bell in the 
Finals by a 9Core of 6-1, 6-2, 5-7, 6-1, thus winning the tournament 
and also the Championship, as last year's Champion, Melville H. Long 
of San Francisco, owing to summer school work, did not come down to 
defend his title. 

Bundy proved decisively that he was the best player in the South by 
defeating m turn such men as Harry Rogers, Charles B. Hopper, A. V. 
Duncan, Claude Wayne and A. E. Bell, losing only one set in the tourna- 
ment and winning a total of 83 games as agamst a total of 81 games lost 

His winning me Championship for 1908 proved a most popular 
victory, as he is a thorougn, good sportsman and has been "knocking 
at the door" for several years. 

Ladies' Singles. 
The presence of our redoubtable Champion, Miss Ma^ Sutton, lent 
the greatest interest to this event, as owing to her joumeyings eastward 
and abroad, she has not contested in any Southern Camomia Cham- 
pionship Tourney for several years. As her sister. Miss Florence Sutton, 
won the Championship in 1907, it was therefore necessary for ''Miss 
May" to play through this tournament which, as a matter of course, she 
did, winnmg the tournament and Championship without the loss of a 
set 

Ladies' Singles Special 

In order to encourage new women players who would otherwise not 
enter the tournaments just to be unmercifully beaten by one of ihe 
Suttons, the association several years ago inaugurated an event which 
has proven to be popular among both players and spectators alike. It 
is a special event for ladies barring anyone who has ever won an open 
tournament In this event there were eight entries, the winner bemg 
Miss Mary Browne, who won without the loss of a set Miss Browne 
defeated Miss Laura McVay in one Semi-Final match, while Mjss 
Helene McVay won from Miss Fanny Rowan in the other Semi-Final

by the close score of 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. In the Final, Miss Browne defeated 
Miss Helene McVay, 6-0, 6-3. This is the first tournament in which 
the Misses McVay have ever competed and their good showing is there- 
fore particularly gratifying. 

Junior Singles. 

Eleven entries in the Junior Singles brought out some promising 
youngsters, some of whom are already making our first-class veterans 
"step some." Ward Dawson, Winired Mace and Charles Rogers 
were thought to have the best chance to win the much-coveted first 
prize offered by the association, a trip including all emenses to the Pacific 
States Championship tournament at Del Monte, Cal, in September, 
to play in the Junior event as Southern California's representative, 
which was won by Rogers 

Gentlemen's Doubles. 

From the first, the sixteen teams entered in Men*s Doubles promised 
many snappy matches, with perhaps the Rogers Brothers, Bundy and 
Overton, Wayne and Variel, or Bell and Way looking the likeUest 
bidders for mial honors. However, even that prospect fell short of 
what the outcome proved. Many exciting matches were played before 
Bell and Way won the tournament, which entitled them to meet the 
Champions, Sinsabaugh and Brown. This proved to be a hard-fought 
and exciting five-set match which was won by the Champions by the 
score of 10-8, 4-6, 6-4, 2-6. 6-4. 

Mixed Doubles. 

In Southern California, perhaps, more than any other locality. Mixed 
Doubles is a most important factor in the tennis tournaments. Probably 
the presence of the Sutton sisters accounts for this unusual interest, 
for their games almost qualifies them to a place among the men. For 
that reason this Final gave promise of a sensation, two Suttons con- 
testing, paired with two of the best players in the South. But the match 
was not up to par. Both men were greatly fatigued from their Men 's 
Doubles, which match had just preceded this, and the victory went 
slowly but surely to "May" and Sinsabaugh, 6-3, 6-3. 

The tournament was brought to a most successful close Saturday 
evening with a banquet and ball at the magnificent Hotel Virginia, 
during which the prizes were presented to the various successful aspirants. 
The tournament was voted by one and all to be the best ever neld in 
Southern California. 

The Scores: Men's Singles. 

Preliminary Round: Charles Hopper beat Paul Radir, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3;

THE OJAI VALLEY TOURNAMENT. 



The annual Ojai Valley tournament tooki&gt;lace on the courts at 
Nordhoff, CaL, April 9 and following days. The entry list was a good 
one comprising such leading players in Northern and Southern Cali- 
fornia as McLoughlin, Gardner, Bundy, Sinsabaugh, Freeman, Miss 
May Sutton, Miss Florence Sutton, Mrs. Farquhar, Mrs. Bruce and 
Miss Ryan, which resulted as expected in an interesting tournament 
and many well contested matches being played. There were five events: 
The Men's Singles, which was won by C. R. Gardner, the Men's 
Doubles which were won by McLoughlin and Gardner, Ladies' Open 
Singles won by Miss May Sutton, Ladies' Open Doubles won by Miss 
May Sutton and Miss Ryan, and the Interscholastic event which was 
the attraction of the tournament. Eighteen schools were represented 
by two boys from each and six girls' sdiools were entered in tne young 
ladies 'events. Charles Rogers of Los Angeles won the boy's tourna- 
ment and Miss Ryan of Marlborough School won the girls. 

Great credit is due W. L. Thatcher, of Thatcher School, in the Ojai 
Valley for his management of the events, together with the tournament 
committee he worked faithfully and hard to have things run smoothly. 

A dance at the Foothills Hotel, band concert and reception on the 
courts and the final reception and dance at the Thatcher School went to 
make the social side of the tournament a grand success. 



LAWN TENNIS IN CANADA 



THE CANADIAN CHAMPIONSHIPS. 



A T annual meeting of the Canadian Lawn Tennis Association, held 
-^^ in Toronto in the spring, it was decided to enlarge the scope of the 
association by putting representatives from each province in Canada 
on the general committee, and at the request of the Montreal represen- 
tative the annual tournament was given to Montreal. This tournament 
has always been held at Niagara-on-the-Lake in the past, and it was an 
experiment to see what Montreal could do. The local committee 
A. C. Dimlop and H. M. Suckling, took the matter in hand, 
and on August 1 the biggest tournament ever held in Montreal was 
started on the beautiful grass courts of the Mount Royal, Lawn Tennis 
Club. There were over 150 entries from everywhere in Eastern Canada , 
among them Ross-Foulkes, the Canadian Champion, from Ottawa, 
Bogs from Barrie, McAvity, Stewart and Inches from St. John, N. B., 
Miss Moyes and Miss Summerhayes from Toronto, and several Toronto 
men who entered, but did not show up. T. Y. Sherwell of Montreal 
won all the open events. He played a strong heady j^me through all 
his matches not being really pressed in any. In the Finals of the Open 
Championship he had a hard fight with the H. M. Suckling, the match 
going to four sets, bu-t Sherwell's low swift screw balls into the comers 
of the court, and his deadly volleying at the net proved sure winners. 
Foulkes, the former Canadian Champion, came down'to defend his Cup, 
and this was the best match of the series, several hundred people sur- 
rounding the championship court when tiie game startea. Foulkes 
had not had much practise and was off his game, though he put up a 
plucky fight to the end. Some of the rallies were beautiful, Sherwell 
playing at the net most of the time and Foulkes preferring the back of 
the court Sherwell won, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. 

The Open Doubles were won by A. C. Dunlop and H. M. Suckling, 
this pair not losing a set during the tournament, although a 12-10 in the 
Finals was a close call. Veysey and Drew, both Englishmen, were the 
runners-up, and gave a beautiful exhibition of Doubles, their play at 
times being spectacular, but not steady enough. Miss Lois Moyes of 
Toronto was on hand to defend her Cup. Her play was far ahead of the 
local ladies pitted against her and she won the Cup for the third time. 
It now becomes her property. Miss Evelyn Clay beat Miss Hague 
and was the challenger for the Cup. A dark horse, E. E. Palmer, with

a big handicap, won the Handicap and also Novice Singles. The tour- 
nament was a success from everv point of view. The weather was per- 
fect and the courts in fine condition. 

Limch and afternoon tea were served on the grounds every day, the 
attendance was good, and the gallery most enthusiastic. Dinners and 
theatre parties for the visitors in which the ladies joined were the order 
every night, and everyone voted the tournament a big success. The 
Cups and prizes were given out by the president of the dub, M. A. D. 
Anderson at the close of the tournament on Wednesday.

INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT. 



The old and attractive annual International Lawn Tennis tournament 
took place as usual on the courts of the Queens Royal Hotel, Nia^ra- 
on-the Lake, Canada, on August 25 and following days and there is no 
better place to spend a week's outing for amusement or rest There 
was a good entry list of over forty in the Singles and sixteen teams in 
Doubles. Nat. NUes of Harvard University won the open after a hard 
match with Wallace Johnson of Philadelpnia who should really have 
been the victor, but the play was to often delayed owing to Niles being 
taken with a cramp in his leg which threw Jolmson off Ins game. Niles 
in his match in the Challenge Round against Irving Wright after being 
completely out-played by Wright in the two first sets got started and 
played some very lively tennis, winning the next three sets and with it 
the title of International Champion. 

The Doubles were won by Emerson and Wright; the Ladies' Singles 
bv Miss Wagner of West Side Club of New York. Thus ended a most 
pleasant week's tennis, particularly to the guests of the hotel and visitors

ONTARIO CHAMPIONSHIP. 



That tennis is rapidly obtaining a stronghold on the affections of 
the Canadian people was evidenced by the mrge entry list and enthu- 
siasm with which the Ontario Championships were run off at the courts 
of the Toronto Tennis Club in the first week of September, 1908. 

The weather throughout the week was ideal and play was continuous 
each morning from 10 o'clock until dusk. 

In addition to all the Toronto experts there was a large entry list from 
outside places. We had the pleasure of renewing our acquaintance 
with Jonnnie AUen, recently of New York, but now of Cobalt, 
whom all readers of the "Guide" will remember as the Doubles partner 
of H. H. Hadcett. Allen displayed all his old-time skill and ex- 
perienced httle difficulty in gettmg into the Finals of the Open Sindbes. 
Here he inet Robert BaiiQ of the Rusholme Tennis Club. The 
match between these two men brought out the best tennis of the year 
and Baird only succeeded in winning out after the hardest kind of a

struck. Allen took the first set quite easily and time and again was 
within a stroke of the second set, but Baird never lost his nerve and 
eventually wore his lighter opponent down, winning by the following 
score, 4-6, 14-12, 8-6,t6-4. This well-earned victory won for Baird 
the right to challenge the Ontario Champion, E. R. Faterson, the 
holder of the Cup. Paterson did not play with his old-time vigor and 
Baird won the match in straight sets by 6-4, 6-4, 7-5. 

The Finals in the Men's Championship Doubles resulted in a stub- 
bom contest between the old Toronto Club veterans, McMasber and 
Glassco, and Bums and Hall, the latter jMiir eventually winning by 
6-4, 7-5, 6-4. This victory entitled the winners to diallenge Messr. 
Baird and Witchall, holders of the Cup, who successfully defended 
their title, winning from the Toronto pair in three close sets, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5. 

Miss Ix)is Moyes, the Canadian Lady Champion, retained her title 
without difficulty, defeating Mrs. Belson of Welland, Ontario, in straight 
sets. 

George Wagner of Buffalo, L. Wick of Cleveland, and the 
redoubtable Harry Avery of Detroit, were guests of the Toronto 
Club during the tennis week. 



QUEBEC CHAMPIONSHIPS. 



The Province of Quebec Lawn Tennis Association held their annual 
tournament on the courts of the Mount Royal Lawn Tennis Club during 
the first two weeks in September, 1908. Owing to the fact that the big 
tournament the Canadian Championship, had been held here earlier 
in the summer, it was only natural that it should interfere to someVx- 
tent with this one. No outside clubs were represented, the tournament 
really being a city one, at the same time the local players showed keen 
interest and some fine matches marked the fmal games. J. Y. 
Sherwell again proved his superiority by successfully defending the 
Quebec Championship Cup. As this is nis third successful win, the 
large silver Cup now becomes his property. His opponent in the Chal 
lenge Round was A. C. Dimlop, who had a great fight in the Finals 
G. W. Grier. These two had met in several Finals before and each was 
determined to win. The match took the best part of three hours and 
the score will show how stubbornly it was fought out Dunlop finally 
won, 8;|6, 6-3, 5-7, 9-7. Sherwell beat Dunlop, 7-5, 6-3, 6-3. 

A. Grier, a young player with a big handicap, played very steadily 
and ^ won the Handicap easily. Mrs. McCullock, the holder of the 
I:rfidies' Championship was in England and could not defend her title, 
which Miss Hague won.

NOVA SCOTIA LAWN TENNIS ASSOCIATION. 



The eighth annual tournament of this association was held on August 
10 to 15 at Truro, Nova Scotia under the auspices of the Truro Lawn 
Tennis Club, who placed their beautiful grounds at the disposal of the 
association. There was a large number of clubs representea and more 
players took part than last year and the playing, taking it all through, 
was of higher order. A feature of the tournament was the playing for 
the Championship in the Men*s Doubles between W. Ritchie and 
F. T. Hands^nbody, Wanderers' Club versus A. C. Wiswell and 
E. Foster, South End Club, the latter players winning out. 

According to the rules the winners of last year's Championship could

Mr. and Mrs. Handsombody, last year's winners, having played sepa- 
rately in the tournament, could not defend their title agamst Hand-

that club on points. 

The Captam Carlow Cup for gentlemen's Singles was presented to 
the winner, A. C. Wiswell. L. A. Gastonguay, the newly-elected Hon. 
secretary-treasurer, was awarded the prize for the most efficient and 
popular umpire. 

Fine weatiier was the order of the day and this allowed the tournament 
to get through nicely taking the whole week. -The Truro Club furnished 
entertainment of a varied sort consisting of a Garden Party at Senator 
Mackay's, a dance at the Agricultural Hall, also an excursion on special 
tram to Tolleigh Lake, and were unceasing in their efforts to give all a 
good time. Everyone present during the tournament enjoyed them- 
selves from a tennis standpoint and also socially. 

The St. Greorge's Lawn Tennis Club of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, 
kindly invited the association to hold its tournament on their ground 
next year, 1909, which invitation was accepted. 

The association is also thinking if at all possible of getting the Canadian 
Championship meet held here next year, 1909, and in event of this we 
would be pleased to have some American players visit us. Grass and 
clay courts are used in this province, but the tendency is for day courts, 
and no doubt next year will see more of the clay court. 

The annual meeting being held the election of officers is as follows: 

Hon. President — ^J. C. lithgow, Halifax, N. S. 

President— J. W. Vidito, Dartmouth, N. S. 

Vice-President — ^Dr. G. J. McDonald, New Glasgow, N. S.

CHAMPIONSHIP OF WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA 



The twentieth annual o^en tennis tournament for the Championship 
of Western Pennsvlvania in Singles was held on the grounds of the 
Pittsburgh Golf Club, Pittsburgh, Pa., on Monday, July 6 and following 
days. The tournament was the most successful and interesting that has 
ever taken place in this district, and attracted the best class of entries. 
There were 31 entries in the Singles, with such players as C. L. Childs, 
who held the title three times as Western Pennsylvania Champion; 
G. D. Edwards, former champion; E. Sunstein, formerly of Princeton: 



202 State Tournaments 

P. D. Siverd, former Interscholastic Champion; C. M. Fincke, the old 
Yale baseball and football player; L. D. Waddell, the Yale baseball 
player; E. M. Byers, of national goW fame, and T. W. Stephens, a former 
Western Pennsylvania Champion. 

In the Final Round Childs defeated Sunstein, 7-5, 4-6, 8-6, 6-4, after 
a very hard match in which both players fought for the position at the 
net. Both players were smashing and volleving beautifully and the 
match brou^t out the prettiest tennis that has been played in Pittsburgh 
for some time. 

In the Challenge match for the J. C. Grogan Cup, C. L. Childs 
(challenger) defeated W. L. Myers (defender), 9-7, 6-4, 6-3. Childs 
was very steady throughout and Myers* form seemed to indicate a lack 
of hard practice, as he did not seem to be able to control his serve or 
ground stroke. 

The audience was the largest that has ever attended a tennis tourna- 
ment in Pittsburgh and was very appreciative of the many fine plays 
that were made. 

C. L. Childs now holds one leg on the new Challenge Cup which was 
won in 1907 by W. L. Myers and in 1906 by T. W. Stephens, the previous 
Cup having been won three times by C. L. Childs, and consequently 
became his personal property. 

The Scores:

NORTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA TOURNAMENT. 



The third tournament of Northwestern Pennsylvania Lawn Tennis 
Association was held at Warren, Pa., August 3 to 7, under the 
auspices of the Warren Tennis Club. Sixteen clubs comprise the 
membership of this association, being from the following places: Erie, 
Franklin, Oil City, Dubois, St. Mary's Smethport, Lockiiaven, Belle- 
fonte, Johnsonburg, Warren, Tidioute, Kane, Ridgway, Bradford and 
Eldred. Thirty-seven entries were received in Singles and nineteen 
in Doubles. 

Marked improvement in almost every team entered was shown over 
the play of previous years. It was also decided that hereafter there 
should be no Challenge Round, but that all contestants should play 
through the tournament on the same basis. There was a keen interest 
taken in the tournament both by players and spectators, which gives 
every promise of the coming fourth annual tournament which is to take 
place at Franklin, Pa., being more successful than former tournaments.

VIRGINIA STATE TOURNAMENT. 



The eighth annual lawn tennis tournament for the Championship of 
Virginia was held under the auspices of the Country Club of Norfolk, 
Va., during the week of June 15, 1908. 

The weather conditions were excellent, all that could have been 
wished for, and although the number of out-of-town entries was not 
large, great interest was created by the plajdng of Franklin Greoghegan 
of Washington, D. C, who won all his matches against the best Norfolk 
players and the Championship Round from Hugh G. Whitehead, who 
already had two legs on the trophy. 

Messrs. Wash, Reed and Hugh G. Whitehead won for the second 
time the Championship in Doubles without much opposition, and Miss 
M. C. Evans of Richmond won the Ladies' Championship in an in- 
teresting match against Mrs. Wallington Hardy of Norfolk. 

Li 1^9 the Country Club is anxious to have more players from other 
cities, and will probably hold the Virginia tournament later in June in 
order to enable more college men to be present. 

The tennis season in Norfolk was the most successful and enthusiastic 
in its history and the local players are very proud that Norfolk's rep- 
resentatives at Atlanta, Ga., J. H. Winston, and Hugh G. Whitehead 
were winners of the Championship of the South, and therefore com- 
peted at Bay Ridge against the East and West. 

Although their showing in New York was a disappo'ntment to their 
friends, me experience will prove very beneficial to Southern players, 
and will result m later years m closer competitions in the Double Cham- 
pionship among the East, West and South. 

Norfolk's new Country Club, situated on a be^tiful body of land in 
full view of the river, will be completed this winter, and will make a 
most attractive spot for the Virginia tournaments in the future.

WEST VIRGINIA STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. 



The ideal weather conditions, the large and fashionable gatherings 
of enthusiastic spectators, the splendid courts and the high class tennis 
exhibited, all contributed to the unqualified success of the third annual 
Invitation tennis tournament, for the Championship of West Virginia, 
held at the Parkersburg Country Club on August 24, 25 and 26, 1908. 
Representative players from all parts of the state were present to com- 
pete for the handsome Challenge Cup, and no effort was spared by the 
management to make the stay of the visitors most pleasant and a^eeable. 
Numerous informal affairs and the big club dance given in honor of 
the visiting players on the last day, were the social features of the week. 

Deserving of special mention was the excellent form displayed by 
E. I. Hanlon, of Sistersville, W. Va., who played through to the Final 
Round, and by the default of Everett Drennen, earned the right to 
challenge the holder of the three-year Cup, Ward White. 

Hanlon, however, seemed to be unable to get going in the Challenge 
match, which was quite a disappointment, on account of the splendid 
showing he had made during nis previous play, he was looked upon as 
having a fine chance to win, however, White won in three straight sets, 
thus giving the victor his second leg on the Challenge Cup. 

Individual Cups were presented to E. I. Hanlon, winner in Singles, 
and to White and Drennen, winners in Doubles. 

Handsome watch fobs were presented to the runner-up in Singles, 
Everett Drennen, and to the runners-up in Doubles, Hubbard and 
Fleming. 

Beautiful jBasks were also presented to R. A. Johnson, winner in 
Singles, and to Bowie and Park, winners in Doubles in the Consolation 
events.

TRI-STATE TOURNAMENT. 



Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky. 



The tenth annual open tournament, held under the auspices of the 
Ohio Ijawn Tennis Association for the Tri-State Championship on the 
courts of tlie Cincinnati Club, was a blue ribbon tennis feature. Those 
of us who were fortunate enough to be present have ample cause for 
congratulation, and those of you who were not there should certainly 
include Cincinnati in your 1909 lawn tennis itinerary. Under the 
leadership of P. B. Stanberry the tournament committee gave a 
most refreshing demonstration of the proper way to conduct a tourna- 
ment. And those followers of the game who have had practical ex- 
I)erience in tournament manajrement will i^eadily appreciate the magni- 
tude of tlie task that confronts a committee which would successfully 
pilot a bi«? tournament embracing five separate events and an entry list 
of one hundred and sixty individual entries. In the opinion of the writer 
the Tri-State tournament is surpassed by no tennis feature on the sched- 
ule. We are accustomed to see large galleries and mammoth entry 
lists at Newport and Ixjngwood, and well remember and cherish dearly 
the courtesy which all receive at Southampton and Orange. But here 
in this Middle W'est feature we find a gallery which for numbers, en- 
thusiasm and "tennis sense" is certainly not surpassed at any tourna- 
ment in the I nited States. For the most part the grand stana at New- 
port is occupied by those who are present, not l)ecause of their tennis 
enthusiasm, but simply because it is the proper thing to do at that par- 
ti(Hilar season of the year, whereas at the Tri-State we see a gallery each 
member of which is a tennis enthusiast. And the feminine portion of 
that Cincinnati gallery certainly losses nothing by comparison with 
the Newport elite. And in addition to this most seemly gallery the visit- 
ing i)layers are at all times surrounded by the Southampton-Orange 
type of courtesy. The pleasure of the visiting players was also gready 
enhanced through the eii'orts of the chairman of the entertainment com- 

^ttee, J. P. Kidney, who is by far the most artistic dispenser of • 
' refreshmant that Cincinnati can boast. No matter how many 



State Tournaments 211 

miles separate you from Cincinnati, the last of August should see you 
on your way to the Tri-State if you wish to experience one of the richest 
of lawn tennis experiences. 

The tournament of 1908 was not up to the usual standard in the way 
of entries. For one reason or another such sterling players as Little 
Palmer, Touchard, Mollenhauer and Dewhurst were compelled, at the 
last moment, to wire their inability to be present. The Eastern contin- 
gent, which ordinarily is extremely stronsr at this tournament, was thus 
reduced to Robert LeRoy, the holder, Chauncey Seaver, S. W. Merri- 
hew and P. B. Hawk. The "star" entry of the tournament was, of 
course, the redoubtable "Nat" Emerson. This sterling player, fresh 
from his Newport successes where he achieved the most notable vic- 
tories of any Western player since the palmy days of Kreierh Collins, 
and bearing the weight of his Western and Northwestern Champion- 
ships upon his shoulders, was to demonstrate his prowess upon his 
native heath. He is the idol of all Cincinnati and a well chosen idol 
is he. Exponents of the game may well give full meed of praise to 
players possessing the true sportsmanship of Emerson. 

The contests throughout the tournament went according to "past 
performances" so far as the main entries were concerned. Emerson 
defeated in succession Hawk and Seaver, both in five-set matches, 
the latter being a "hair raising" exhibition in which Seaver played 
excellent tennis, but Emerson was finally victorious. However, the 
really "big" event of a Championship tournament is, of course, the 
Challenge Match. In this case it brought Robert LeRoy and the idol- 
ized "Nat" into the roped arena. The class of the contestants augured 
well for a spectacular, long drawn out and hard-fought combat. It was 
not to be, however, for it was at once apparent, that Emerson was not 
in the form which had won him his season's laurels. We do not mean 
by this to detract one whit from the honor due to LeRoy. This most 
excellent player would certainly have won even with Emerson at his 
best for the classy tennis shown by the brilliant New Yorker was seldom 
excelled on any court during the season. Emerson was not in the least 
disgraced by his defeat, for none of the "topnotchers" excepting Cham- 
pion Lamed and Beals Wright (on his Newport or Australian form) 
could have sent Robert LeRoy to defeat the afternoon of his signal 
triumph over "Nat" Emerson. 

Miss Mariorie Dodd and Miss Martha Kinsey, who contested in the 
Final Round of Ladies' Singles, would certainly be able to set a nice 
fast pace for some of the Eastern "cracks" at St. Martins. Cincin- 
nati would be well represented if these young women were to try for 
Championship honors. 

In tne Men's Doubles Emerson and Hunt were at no time extended. 
The Mixed Doubles were captured by Miss McLaug:hlin and Dr. 
Karl Little who succeeded in handily winning from Miss Dodd and

Dr. Hawk, and also came out victorious over Miss Kruse and Mr. 
Seaver after a rathier strenuous session.

ILLINOIS STATE TOURNAMENT.

days. The entry list in the Men's Singles was unusually large, the 
Men 's Doubles drew well also, but lack of women entrants necessitated 
the cancelling of the Doubles and Mixed Doubles events for women.

MONTANA STATE TENNIS TOURNAMENT. 






The class of play and attendance at the fourteenth annual Montana 
state tournament held at Helena, Montana, August 17 to 22, was most 
gratifying. A week of beautiful weather, augmented greatly by the 
hospitality, attendance and applause of the fair devotees of the game 
early in the tournament, put every visitor at ease, and as a result each 
[)ut forth his best efforts. The matches throughout were, with but 
few exceptions, hard fought, and in many instances, closer than the 
final scores would indicate. 

The matches between Mosher of Butte, and Agar of Great Falls, 
Johnson of Helena and Mattison of Great Falls, Karsted of Butte and 
Burton of Butte, were perhaps the most noteworthy of the tournament, 
the class of tennis being of high order in each and the results uncertain 
until the last points had been played. 

Burton of Butte, through brilliant and consistent work during the 
entire tournament, without question earned the right to challenge State 
Champion D. D. McLaughlin of Butte for supreme honors. This 
long, nard-fought five-set match was fraught with added interest by 
reason of the fact that its outcome was to decide, in case of a third victory 
by Champion McLaughlin, the ownership of the beautiful silver trophy, 
which for a decade and more has been the unattainable goal of every 
tennis player in the state. 

The weather was perfect and the audience large, enthusiastic and im- 
partial, and the fact that Burton lost, and McLEiughlin, the grand old 
man of the tennis game in this state, won, is but another illustration of 
the old axiom that every rule has its exceptions. Youth did not conae 
out victorious; McLau^jnlin, with his half century and more of years, 
perfect physical condition and untiring energy and unfailing accuracy 
and precision, emerged from the contest a winner, and apparently as 
fresh as at its commepcement 

The business meeting resulted, after a spirited controversy, in the 
selection of an eastern aty for the next meeting place of the tournament 
in 1909, the Livingston club, sponsors of the Hunters' Hot Springs' 
courts, convincing the meeting that the interests of tennis in Mx&gt;ntana 
would be best subserved by such a choice. The state officers elected 
were the following: President, A. R. Mosher, Butte; vice-president, 
J. D. Miles, Livingston; secretary-treasurer, George M. Parker, Living- 
ston.

OKLAHOMA STATE TOURNAMENT. 



The first tennis tournament for the Championship of Oklahoma 
State took place at Oklahoma City the week of September 1 on the courts 
of the Putnam Park Club. The winner of the tournament, J. T. Bailey, 
who has made a good showing in many of the western events during 
the summer won the tournament by steady play and the handling of 
his well balanced Ward &amp; Wright racket with good effect. 

This was the first state tournament held in Oklahoma and was pro- 
nounced quite a success. The Championship of the coming season is 
looked forward to with interest.

OREGON STATE TOURNAMENT. 



Portland felt proud. Indeed Portland felt very proud, for in the 
summer time came journeying from all directions a delegation of tennis 
players that would certainly grace the courts of any clime or country. 

From the Sunny South came Lou Freeman, who renewed his old- 



^34 State Tournaments 

time acquaintance and once more looked upon the Cups he used to take 
away so handily. 

From Berkeley came that delightful and wonderful player, Miss Hazel 
Hotchkiss, and from Spokane came that stalwart, bright and shining 
light in Pacific Northwest tennis, Wallace A. McBumey, with his left- 
handed partner, Joseph Tyler. 

Many lesser lights appeared on the scene and to make a perfect tourna- 
ment Portland enjoyed the privilege of entertaining^ the guests on the 
grounds of the Irvington Tennis Club. 

Everyone in Irvington kept open house and the week was full of 
enjoyment. An informal party on Monday night at the club house 
started the social activities and with several luncheons, an evening at 
"The Oaks," an auto touring evening and the Tennis Ball on Friday 
night, the week was quite complete. 

Of tennis there can much be said and since Portland was the only 
tournament in which Wallace A. McBumey played, aside from his 
home town, it probably takes first place in the way of prominence in 
the Northwest circuit for 1908, smce McBumey was ranked first 
by the ranking committee of the North Pacific International Lawn 
lennjs Association and were it possible, he doubtless would secure a 
rank up next to the top for the Pacific Coast. 

What a pity he could not go to Del Monte this sununer. 

The wins were clean cut and without any question of doubt. 

Miss Hotchkiss set at rest any chance for outsiders in the Ladies' 
Singles, Ladies' Doubles and Mixed Doubles. 

Unfortunately Portland lost an opportunity in presenting a firet-class 
team of Men's Doubles, and this event was not of any special interest 
and went quite easily to McBumey and Tyler. 

The Gentlemen's Singles was a different proposition, and to follow 
the winner through his maze of wins and difficult situations takes mental 
activities worthy of a Napoleon. Several matches stand out as mile 
posts in his progress. Goss was his first man of any prominence, but 
he did not make much more than a reasonably decent fight. "Mac" 
had to to keep his wits about him but he was not pressed. 

Jordan was the next trader who negotiated for the place. Here was 
some of the prettiest tennis ever played. AVhat a wonder Jordan would 
make were ne able to control himself and had a little better physique. 

Lou Freeman should not have taken part in the Singles competition" 
for he was imable to keep up the pace set by men in good trim and he 
was forced to default to McBumey after showing good form, although 
he did not show that he ever possessed the wonderful play of the latter. 

The Challenge Roimd was somewhat of a foregone conclusion. Tyler 
and McBumey had met many times before, and while Mac occasionally 
has an off day he had the thmg pretty well in hand when he faced Joe 
for the Oregon State Championship. Tyler is a fine player with no 
end of endurance and a wonderful propensity for doing the impossible. 



State Toubnaments 235 

He can stand on his head and play a half volley on his back hand at the 
same time, but this won't do against the tremendous game of Wallace 
A. McBurney. 

McBumey is the same kind of a man that could get a lot of men over 
the Delaware, he would have captured Port Arthur if given the chance, 
and lie would be just the fellow to tackle Jim Jeffries if he were so in- 
clined and big enough. 

He has the i)hysique, the head, the tremendous capacity for work and 
the determination to do a good, clean job on a tennis court. 

We in Portland take our hats off to our Champion, Wallace A. Mc- 
Bumey.

NATIONAL INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS. 



HELD February 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 2(5, 27. 
The year nineteen hundred and nine marks the tenth consecutive 
year, that the National Indoor Championships have been successuUy 
terminated at the Seventh Regiment Armory, New York City, and the 
championships which the Seventh Re&lt;;iment inausfurated in February, 
1900, have each year increased in popularity, until 1909 with an entry 
list of sixty-one in Singles and twenty-seven in Doubles, broke all former 
records for an indoor lawn tennis tournament of any kind, and the name 
af Cragin, which family of four brothers originated the idea of the 
"National Indoor Championships" in 1900, as previous to that time 
the only Indoor Championships were "Handicap'* events and not 
sanctioned by the U. S. N. L. 1. A., were as much in 'evidence as ever 
and their interest and enthusiasm help to make every year a success. 

Theodore Roosevelt Pell, Champion of 1907, won the Championship 
without the loss of a set, tlie first time this has been accomplished since 
the tournament started in 1900, and Wylie C. Grant, four times Cham- 
pion, for the first time in eight years missed the Final Round by beingf 
defeated by Pell in the Fourth round, 16-14, 9-7, in a gruelling match 
after Grant in the first set had led with the vantage game and 40-15 
These two sets with Grant which were" close all the way, and the first set 
against W. B. Cragin, Jr. in the Semi-Finals, when Cragin led Pell in 
the first set, 4-0, and 40-15, were the nearest that Pell came to losing a 
set In the Finals against G. Carleton Shafer, although Pell did not 
show at his best, Shafer made an imexpectedly fine showing leading 3-2 
in the first and third sets, being defeated 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. 

The Doubles were somewhat of a repetition of the Singles inasmuch 
as nearly all the favorites were drawn in the upper half. H. H. Hackett, 
last year's Champion in Doubles, with F. B. Alexander played witli 
Raymond D. Little, but after two rounds were defeated by T. R. Pell 
and W. C. Grant, 7-5, 7-5, who went through the tournament without 
the loss of a set, narrowly escaping in the last set of the Final Round 
when after defeating \V. B. Cragin, Jr., and M. S. Charlock the first 
two sets, 6-3, 6-2, Cragin and Charlock led 5-4, 40-15.

LAWN TENNIS NOTES. 



In referring to their visit to Australia, the American team s^ak 
most highly of the way they were favored by the tennis committee 
who did evervthing to make their visit a pleasant one, while the umpire 
and linesmen s decisions were most satisfactory. 

It is sure to add a new interest to the game in the West by having the 
preliminaries in Doubles between teams from the East, South, West 
and Pacific Coast played on the grass courts of the Onwentsia Grolf 
Club, Lake Forest, which are located 30 miles out of Chicago, III. 
(See fixtures for date) the winner of which will be entitled to play 
the present Champions at Newport. 

Uj)on the visit of the Eastern players to California last season to take 
part in the Pacific States Championship, the home players showed a 
keen interest in watching and noticing how diflterent the style of play 
of the visitors was from their own, winning their strokes by placing 
the ball, while California players were more for winning their point by 
killing the ball or a severe passing stroke across court. What effect 
it wiU have on their play in going firom asphalt to ^ss courts is 
hard to tell, though it bothered me Eastern men but little m making the 
change. 

Beals Wright, upon his return home from his trip to Australia where 
he went as one of the team to play in the Davis Cup Matches, was given 
a dinner by his club, the Longwood Cricket Club, at which he gave 
a very interesting account of the hard-fought matches he and his partner 
Alexander had with the Australians, Brookes and Wilding. 

Mrs. Sterry, who won the English Championship last year, has 
won it four times before. She plays a steady all-round gams but 
not so brilliant or severe a stroke as tiie ex-Champion, Mrs. Chambers. 

A. W. Grore, winnCT of the English Championship, has also won 
it three times. He is over forty years of age; his play is princi- 
pMdly from the back of the court, his strokes are accurate witli 
plenty of speed. He won the Indoor Championship the past winter. 

Players and those interested in the game throughout the country, 
should subscribe and add their support to "American Lawn Tennis," 
which has during the past two years proven itself worthy of their sup- 
port as the accounts of tournaments and items of interest with pictures 
of players and different club courts makes it a most attractive and in- 
teresting paper. Address S. W. Merrihew, Terminal Building, 41st St., 
and Park Avenue, New York City.

250 Lawn Tennis Notes 

After many years trying the English Lawn Tennis Association started 
last year a school tournament (the same idea as the Interscholastic 
tournament in this country) whidi was most successful and from whidi 
England hopes to get her future Lawn Tennis Champions. 

R. D. Wrenn, Beals Wright and Karl Behr were Interscholastic 
National Champions and have played on International teams. 

Tlie following was taken from an Australian paper: 

"Although defeated, it will doubtless be gratifying to our esteemed 
visitors and their Association to know that this visit, which brought 
about the first International Lawn Tennis Contest in Australia, has* 
given a tremendous stimulus, and has been of inestimable value to our 
favorite game in this quarter of the globe. 

"This report would not be complete without referring to the particu- 
larly favorable impression universally created by our visitors both off 
and on the courts. They, after being thoroughly tested, signally proved 
themselves to be true sportsmen and worthy representatives of their 
great nation. 

"Whilst justly lauding our opponents, we must not forget our own rep- 
resentatives. The heartiest thanks of our Association are due to 
N. E. Brooks and A. F. Wilding for so successfully and ably defending 
the coveted ('up. Both put forth their best efforts, and joined with 
our visitors in providing the finest display of lawn tennis ever seen in 
Australia or possibly elsewhere, and the most exciting and strenuous 
contest in the history of the International Matches." 

Read carefully the revised Foot Fault Rule on page 12. 

It is suggested that the most practical way to jud'^e a foot fault is for 
the umpire to watch only the server's feet, and to determine when the 
service is delivered, by the sound of the impact of racket and ball. 

The foot fault umpire should be in line with the base line. 

The following instructions were given to the linesmen at the Davis 
Cup IVIatclies played at I^ongwood last fall: 

The linesmen's position is a responsible one, therefore, his attention 
should be fixed on his duty and he should neither converse nor should 
his decisions be influenced by the remarks of others. 

Under no circumstances is a linesman to leave his post while the match 
is being played. 

The only words a linesman should use are "out" or "fault" and 
these should be called out loudly, distinctly and promptly enough so 
that both players and the umpire may understand; if, however, a player 
asks for a decision (how is it?) while the ball is in play, and the ball 
is good, the linesman should say "play" in a quick clear and loud voice. 
(Ine word "play" is preferable to "good.") 



Lawn Tennis Notes 251 

Never render a decision before the ball strikes the ground, but if it 
strikes "out'* as soon thereafter as possible. 

When a ball land^ obviously out no decision need be called, but all 
balls landing within 3 feet outside of the line taken by the linesman 
should be called "out" as the players are frequently not in the right 
position to see. 

A linesman is placed in a position to decide as best he can on the line 
in question and nis decision is final whether right or wrong. 

Fred H. Hovey, the winner of the National Championship in 1895, 
has played but little tennis since that time, and is now an expert at 
Squash Racquets, being one of the team who won the New England 
Championship. 

The Coronado Country Club tournament, held annually at Coronado, 
Cal., February 17 to 22, is the one in which the prominent tennis players 
of the Pacific Coast open their season. The different events this season 
were won as follows: Singles, McLaughlin; Doubles, Bundy and Sinsa- 
baugh; Ladies' Singles, Miss May Sutton; Mixed Doubles, Miss Sutton 
and Mr. Sinsabaugh.

In tournament matches the linesmen are carefully selected and usually 
players of experience who are impartial. Now if a wrong decision is 
made should a player who is benefitted "throw** the next point by de- 
liberately knocking the ball out or into the net ? Of course the average 
onlooker applauds, but this is entirely wrong. 

The players go on the court with the understanding to abide by the 
linesmen's and umpires* decisions and when they do not, it only cheapens 
them, makes them more timid in calling and harder for the committee 
to get men to serve as linesmen. It also puts the opposing player in a 
peculiar position. Such a thing should not be encouraged as decisions 
usually even up in a match. 

This point occurred several times last year and cannot be termc&lt;l 
sportsmanlike. 



252 Lawn Tennis Notes 

Isaac Chambers, the experienced groundsman of the Longwood 
Club of Boston, gives the few following hints about grass courts: 

There is no hard and fast rule or method for taking care of grass courts. 
Work which would be all right one day might be all wrong the next. 
For example: At times during the season cutting the grass once a week 
is suflficient, while at another time two or three cuttings are required, and 
during tournaments they must be cut every day; but for club use twice 
a week is a fair average. It is possible, during hot weather, to cut grass 
too short. 

At Longwood, for four or five weeks before a big tournament we be- 
gin to pay a little extra attention to the lawn by way of watering a great 
deal, moving courts oftener. For example, some courts are not allowed 
to stay in one place more than one week, and others not more than three 
or four days. This prevents bare spots resulting from wear which would 
otherwise appear, no matter how small. 

For club use at Longwood any number of courts up to twenty are 
needed, according to the time of season. These are rolled and marked 
every day, a twelve hundred pound roller being used, with brush in 
front, two or three times per week, or if conditions are favorable a three 
ton roller is put on onpe or twice a week. This roller is drawn by one 
horse and cannot be used when the grass is wet, or when the courts are 
too heavy without danger to horse and damage to lawn. For a week 
before and during a tournament, this roller is put on every day, and it is 
surprising how much rolling a lawn will stand before kimng the grass. 
The courts should always be rolled and cut crosswise. 

In June, for the Massachusetts State Championship twenty courts 
are used, at Longwood. Fifteen are placed side by side, twelve feet 
apart. For the Longwood open tournament in July twelve courts are 
used, more room being allowed players, twenty feet at the side and twenty- 
five to thirty at the end of the courts. For play in international matches, 
twenty-five feet at the side and thirty at the end are allowed. 



History tells us that lawn tennis was first played with a cork ball, 
which was originally struck with the hand, much as in our present game 
of Hand-Ball, a bank of earth or mud about two feet high serving the 
same pu^ose as our modem net. As the game grew in severity a glove 
was used to cover the hand, as is often done today in Hand-Ball; then 
some pioneer introduced strings across the palm of the hand from thumb 
to fingers, and with these the ball was given greater impetus with less 
impact. It was a short jump from that to a frame-work for the strings, 
which was held first in the hand, and a handle for the frame soon fol- 
lowed, forming the crude model from which our familiar rackets used 
in so many ball games were all evolved. 



How to Make a Lawn Tennis Court 



In making a Lawn Tennis Court there should be, if 
possible, a dear margin of at least 12 feet on each side 
and 21 feet at each end of the court, or, between adjacent 
courts, 18 feet on each side; but should the courts be placed 
end to end, or end to side, there should be spaces of 42 
feet or 33 feet respectively, and a back-net at least 8 feet 
high between. 

The cheapest and most easy court to make is a 

Clay Court 

It is done by removing the sward from the lawn, taking 
care that the same is cut deep enough not to allow any of 
the grass roots to remain; there should be a space dug out 
118 feet by 56 and about 6 or ten inches deep, fill in with 
yellow day and cover with ^-inch of carefully sifted bind- 
mg gravel, taking out aU small stones to the size of a pea. 
wet well and roU into the foundation of clay, if the court 
continues to be soft or sticky spread more binding gravel 
over it, and continue to roll until the dav and eravd com- 
mences to bind and becomes firm. 1 he maker of the 
court will have to use his own best judgment about this, 
as it's hard to dedde the exact quantities of day and lind- 
ing gravd that should be used to cause the court to have 
the proper firmness. 

In making the court there should be a gradual slope 
from the base lines to the centre, running across the court 
between the net posts should be built a blind drain, this is 
done to take off tne water after a heavy rain. 

A stone foundation is bad for a court as it becomes hard 
and dry and severe on a player's feet and legs to play on. 

Grass Courts 

These can be made in three ways: namel^r. first, by 
mproving an existing stretch of turf until it is level 
and smooth enough, second by leveh'ng the ground. 

253 



254 How TO Make a Lawn Tennis Court 

preparing the soil, ami sowing grass seeds ; and third, 
by laying fresh turf. Of these the former is of course 
the simplest ; but as the requisite piece of gras*! land 
is rarely available, particulars for preparing it are 
seldom required. In improving such a piece of turf 
care should be taken to remove all weeds or coarse 
grasses, and io freely use the spirit-level. To raise 
hollow places the turf should be cut out, lifted, and 
fine soil placed underneath until the proper height 
has been obtained, when the turf should be replaced 
and well beaten down with the fiat side of a spade. 
On the other hand, small mounds should be removed 
by taking the soil away from under the grass, some 
fine mould being placed, underneath tne turf before 
it is replaced. To prepare a court for sowing seeds 
the same iiistructions may be followed as for making 
a turf- laid one, except that the seed will be sown 
instead of the turfs laid. Take care that the seed is 
-good by purchasing from a first-class seedsman, and, 
wnen ordering, it will be well to state what sort of 
soil is to be sown. By far the larger number of 
courts ^re made by laying fresh turfs. 

When preparing the ground for a court, it is de- 
sired to level a portion measuring 100 x 50 feet, 
which allows an ample margin ; but for the playing 
portion itself only 78 x b6 feet is necessary. If 
economy must be strictly considered only the latter 
need be carefully prepared, but it is better to have 
the whole done if possible. 



HOW TO MARK OUT A COURT 




Ag a doable court practicailj' includes every line to 
be found in a single coiut, it is best to take first the 
measure for the latter. Having determined the posi* 
tion of your net, plant in the pround, in the line 
chosen, two pegs, 27 feet apart (a* the points A and 
B in the diagram). Then take two measures and 
attach their respective ends to the pegs A and B. On 
the first, which wiD measure the diagonal of the court, 
take a length of 47 ft. 5 in. ; on the other 39 ft. ; poO 
both taut in such directions that at these distances 
they meet in a point C. This will give one comer of 
|fa«XQUrt* At that point F, ai feet from B, put in a

peg to mark the end of tlie aervioe-fiiie. The othei 
corner, D, and the other end of the service-line G, 
may be found by interchanging the measures and re- 
peating the process. The same measurements on the 
other side of the net will complete the exterior bound- 
aries of the court. By prolonging the base-line 4 ft. 
6 in. in each ditection, and joining the four new points 
thus obtained, we can make the side-lines of a double 
court. It only remains to mark the central Mne. This 
is done by joining the middle points of the service* 
lines. If a double court alone be required* the inte- 
rior side-lines need not be prolonged to meet the base* 
lines. Remember that in all cases the net-posts must 
•land at a distance of three feet from the side-tiiiea.

4 The frames are made from selected material and by experts 
who thoroughly understand the use of them, and so far as 
human skill can determine the frames are as perfect as it is 
possible to make them. 

4 The gut used in our rackets is the very best that it is possible 
to procure. Our expert makes a special trip abroad every year 
in order that we may get the first and best selection, and we 
believe that our rackets are strung with the choicest gut that 
the world produces, and by stringera who have made a study 
of stringing rackets for years. 

4 We do all it is possible for anyone to do to make perfect 
rackets. Gut, however, is sensitive to atmospheric changes, 
and owners of rackets should take all the precautions they 
possibly can to prevent their being exposed to d&amp;mpness, keep- 
ing the racket in a waterproof cover and in a press. Yet no 
matter how careful a player may be, the natural wear on a 
racket, particularly on dirt courts, often causes the strings to 
give way. The expense of repairing this break (as it occurs 
through no defect of the racket), should be borne by the player.
