patriarch of drag racing dies at age 94
</a></div>
<FONT class=medwhite face="">Wally Parks, the driving force behind the formation of NHRA, has died at the age of 94. It was Parksï¿½ vision, goals and unconditional commitment to the need for speed and side-by-side racing in a safer, more controlled environment that created what is today the world's largest motorsports governing body.
<p>"Today is a sad day in the world of NHRA and the sport of drag racing," said Tom Compton, president of NHRA. "Words simply can't describe the immeasurable impact Wally has had on the sport he created and the millions of people's lives he touched along the way. The name Wally Parks is synonymous with drag racing, and his vision and direction will guide NHRA for years to come.  Everyone in drag racing, and the industries formed to service the sport, will forever be indebted to Wally, his vision, his focus and his desire to create, build and grow NHRA."

<FONT class=medwhite face="">"Isn't it about time that the thousands of hot rod devotees around the United States band together in a national association?" So began a letter to the editors of <i>Hot Rod</i> magazine, published in its March 1951 issue. Its editor in those formative days of the hot-rodding scene was a transplanted Oklahoman whose active automotive interest didn't really surface until his family moved to California in the early 1920s, but who quickly became part of the car culture, tearing down Model-T Fords and Chevy 4s for street use and in the 1930s and '40s racing in weekend time trials conducted on the dry lake beds of California's deserts. His name was Wally Parks.
