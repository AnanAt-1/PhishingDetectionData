          <a name="CT" id="CT">CONNECTICUT's longest-running morning team hung up their
    headphones last week after nearly two decades on the
    air -- and not completely willingly.  It's been no secret for
    the last year or so that Bruce Barber was looking to leave the
    &quot;Smith &amp; Barber&quot; morning show on WPLR (99.1 New Haven), but it
    still came as a surprise to listeners when the show was nowhere to
    be found last Friday morning.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Station officials say Barber had mentioned several times
    that he was getting bored with the show; they considered keeping
    co-host Brian Smith as a solo act, but decided instead to buy out
    the rest of the duo's contracts.  The decision came as a surprise
    to Smith, who tells Connecticut media outlets he wasn't expecting
    the show to end when it did.</p>
        <p>The show's sidekicks, Megan Doll and Billy Winn, will stay
    on board when WPLR's new morning show launches later this month.
    Chaz and AJ come to the Cox rocker from Barnstable's WRCN (103.9
    Riverhead) on Long Island; Chaz is a former night jock at
    WPLR.</p>
        <p>Barber tells the <cite>New Haven Register</cite>
    that he's planning to start an Internet site to give parents
    advice on raising children; Smith says he has some possibilities
    but nothing definite.  And while Cox offered the pair a chance to
    do a farewell show on Friday, they declined, saying it's hard to
    wrap up 18 years in four hours.</p>
        <p>One other bit of Nutmeg State news: WHCT-LP (Channel 69) in
    Hartford has been granted a license to cover for its move down to
    channel 38.  We'd love to hear from readers in the area who can
    tell us what this one is programming lately!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="MA" id="MA">MASSACHUSETTS is home to one of the two stations in America
    whose call letters are the same as its city of license (WACO in
    Waco, Texas being the other) -- and listeners to WARE (1250)
    in Ware have something new to enjoy this week.</a>
        </p>
        <p>New owner Success Signal Broadcasting (helmed by Marshall
    Sanft, former owner of WESO in Southbridge) launched an oldies
    format on WARE Saturday, featuring veteran central Massachusetts
    jock Fred King in morning drive, a daily &quot;Polka Hour&quot; from 11 to
    noon (and all morning on Sunday), and an interesting lineup of
    local talk shows on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.  Dennis
    Jackson (of WQQQ/WMEX/WRIP fame) has a hand in this one too; he
    and programmer Jay &quot;Biggie&quot; Fink are behind the deep, deep oldies
    format on the 5000-watter, which blankets the territory between
    Springfield and Worcester.</p>
        <p>More deep oldies are being heard at 1520 on the dial: we
    hear that WGAM (1520 Greenfield) has finally changed calls to WIZZ
    and is running commercial-free for the moment.</p>
        <p>The local cable newscasts that served Lowell and Cape Cod
    for more than a decade are history: Comcast applied the budget axe
    to the &quot;AT&amp;T 3&quot; channel, a legacy of previous owners AT&amp;T
    Broadband and MediaOne.  The cuts left a number of talented
    small-market newspeople out of work.  Programming on the channel
    is reportedly being pulled back closer to Comcast HQ in
    Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The FCC granted a CP this week for the new channel 51 in
    Pittsfield; as expected, the Albany-market station will be on
    Berry Mountain, northwest of Pittsfield, running 1580 kW
    visual.</p>
        <p>Think the noncommercial FM dial is crowded enough in eastern
    Massachusetts?  California-based Calvary Satellite Network
    doesn't; its two-year-old application for a new station on 90.5 in
    Scituate was accepted for filing this week.  It proposes 5 watts
    vertical, 21.6 kW horizontal at 88 meters above average terrain,
    from a site nowhere near Scituate on route 3A near Manomet,
    southeast of Plymouth -- with a directional antenna, yet,
    nulled towards Cape Cod (and adjacents WCCT 90.3 and WKKL 90.7).
    All that, and do you think there will be even a minute of local
    programming aimed at Scituate? Insert the usual rant
    here....</p>
        <p>Down in the New Bedford market, WFHN (107.1 Fairhaven) was
    granted a license this week for its transmitter site at UMass
    Dartmouth -- even though the station wants to move back to
    its old site at Popes Island, closer to downtown New Bedford.
    WFHN had been operating from Fairhaven under a construction permit
    for the last couple of years; if it hadn't filed for a license,
    the CP would have expired.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="RI" id="RI">Across the line in RHODE ISLAND, the FCC has flagged the
    proposed sale of WWKX (106.3 Woonsocket) and WAKX (102.7
    Narragansett Pier) to Citadel; that's no great surprise, given
    Citadel's market share in the Providence market -- but we
    don't expect much delay in the sale as a result.</a>
        </p>
        <p>The proposed sale of WALE (990 Greenville) to Jerry Evans'
    Moon Song Broadcasting never went through last year -- and
    now owner Francis Battaglia has an additional headache in addition
    to his Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings: the FCC has fined him
    $4,000 for not reducing the power at his KFNX (1100 Cave
    Creek-Phoenix AZ) at sunset.  (NERW hears this has been a problem
    at WALE, as well....)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="NH" id="NH">A format change in NEW HAMPSHIRE: WLTN (1400 Littleton)
    flips from news-talk to oldies; the station (and sister WLTN-FM
    96.7 Lisbon) is being run by veteran New England broadcaster Barry
    Lunderville (who owns nearby WXXS 102.3) under an LMA, with an
    option to buy.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Down in Keene, the FCC has cancelled the license of W288AM
    (105.5); last we heard, the translator had been relaying WRSY
    (101.5 Marlboro VT).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="ME" id="ME">MAINE Public Broadcasting announced budget cuts last week,
    including cutting back six jobs.  The statewide broadcaster says
    it's $385,000 short, thanks to dropoffs in viewer donations and
    cuts in state funding.  It will add pledge drives and eliminate
    weekly production of its &quot;Speaking in Maine&quot; radio show to help
    make ends meet.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Winslow's WWWA (95.3) has applied to boost power and move
    its transmitter.  The religious station wants to become a class
    C3, running 5800 watts at 205 meters from a new site just east of
    Norridgewock.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="NJ" id="NJ">Down to NEW JERSEY we'll go, next, to find another change of
    simulcast at Millennium's cluster in the Atlantic City
    market.</a>
        </p>
        <p>WKXW (101.5 Trenton)'s talk programming moved last year from
    WBSS (97.3 Millville, now hot AC &quot;Mix&quot; WIXM) to WKXW (1450
    Atlantic City, the former WFPG) -- and at the same time, the
    hot AC moved from &quot;Shore&quot; WKOE (106.3 Ocean City) to WIXM.</p>
        <p>WKOE became CHR &quot;Hot 106.3,&quot; but it didn't last; as of
    Saturday, &quot;Hot&quot; is gone and WKOE now carries the simulcast from
    &quot;New Jersey 101.5.&quot;  What of WKXW(AM), then? It's now doing ESPN
    radio, still with Harry Hurley's local morning show.</p>
        <p>Over in Brigantine, Calvary Satellite Network has been
    granted a new signal on 90.5.  The new station will run 1.31 kw,
    vertical only, at 33 meters -- with a directional antenna
    from a site just east of Smithville, New Jersey.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="NY" id="NY">Still no new format at NEW YORK's WNEW (102.7), though Allan
    Sniffen's New York Radio Message Board has been carrying some very
    detailed descriptions of a female-leaning, entertainment-heavy pop
    format to be programmed by John Sykes and Andy Schuon (of MTV and
    VH1 fame).  With the stunting now promoting a new station coming
    &quot;this spring,&quot; it sounds as though it may be a few months before
    we see whether this one pans out or not....</a>
        </p>
        <p>South of Albany, WCKL (560 Catskill) is changing hands from
    Concord Media to &quot;Black United Fund of New York&quot;; no word yet on
    what changes might come to the station, which is now doing
    standards.</p>
        <p>Albany talk host J.R. Gach has a new home: the former WGY
    (810 Schenectady) afternoon host, whose career there ended when he
    was diagnosed with mental illness last year, is now doing mornings
    on Galaxy rocker WKRD (93.7 Scotia).</p>
        <p>In Kingston, WBPM (94.3) is now being run by Cumulus from
    its Pendell Road studios in Poughkeepsie; &quot;Cool 94.3&quot; has added a
    local morning show with Nick Robbins (from sister station WCZX
    97.7.)</p>
        <p>Up in the Glens Falls market, Vox has parted ways with WNYQ
    (105.7 Queensbury) program director Jackie Donovan; Justin Clapp
    adds WNYQ programming duties to his operations manager title at
    the cluster there, while Chad Herron (late of WLZW in Utica) comes
    on board as afternoon jock/production director.</p>
        <p>Rochester jazz station WGMC (90.1 Greece) had its
    application for a power increase returned this week by the FCC;
    we'll keep you posted as this one progresses.</p>
        <p>And over in Buffalo, WWKB (1520) finished off its first week
    of oldies with plenty of publicity and message-board
    chatter -- and spent most of the week as the only station on
    the radio here at NERW Central.  So far, we're enjoying most of
    what we're hearing, especially when it comes to Jackson
    Armstrong's screaming 6-10 PM shift, which just may be the best
    voicetracking we've ever heard.  We're still a little disconcerted
    by hearing the early 60s &quot;Futuresonic&quot; jingles mixed in with 70s
    rock, but it's still early in the game over there, and we're sure
    some of those kinks will be worked out as 'KB gets back on its
    feet after all these years.</p>
        <p>On the DTV front, Clear Channel won extensions this week for
    WIXT-DT (Channel 17) in Syracuse and WETM-DT (Channel 2) in
    Elmira.  Up in Watertown, expect WWNY-DT (Channel 35) on the air
    within a few months, we're told; on the analog side, WWNY-TV
    (Channel 7) morning host Mark Mason has accepted a buyout offer
    and will soon be leaving the CBS affiliate.</p>
        <p>We're very sorry to have to report the death of Stan Martin,
    whose career in New York City radio included stops at WPIX-FM,
    WHN, WKTU, WNEW and WFAN.  Martin was best known, though, for his
    1992-1998 run as program director of WQEW (1560), the last attempt
    at programming pop standards on the New York City dial.  Since
    WQEW's flip to Radio Disney, Martin had been doing standards shows
    in syndication and on-line.  He suffered a stroke recently, and
    died Tuesday (January 28) at Lenox Hill Hospital.  Martin was
    64.</p>
        <p>We also remember Stan Hayes, who was the very first voice
    heard on WINR-TV (Channel 40, now WICZ) in Binghamton when it
    signed on in 1957.  Hayes, who later went on to be the news
    director/anchor on WBJA (Channel 34, now WIVT) in the seventies,
    died Friday (Jan. 31).</p>
        <p>And one late bit of news for the DXers out there: just as
    this issue of NERW was going to press, we heard from WBBR (1130)
    chief engineer Bob Janney, who tells us there will be a silent
    period on WBBR and WEVD (1050) next weekend.  Listen for something
    else on both channels between 1:00 and 4:00 AM on Saturday morning
    (Feb. 8) and Sunday morning (Feb. 9); WWDJ (970 Hackensack NJ)
    will also be off, at least briefly, during those times.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="PA" id="PA">From PENNSYLVANIA comes word that oldies station WPAM (1450
    Pottsville) went dark on Friday.  The station had been under a
    five-year LMA to crosstown WPPA (1360) and WAVT (101.9), but when
    that expired, there was nobody around to run 1450.  We hear it'll
    be back under new management, eventually.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Philadelphia's WURD (900) is being sold as part of the
    gradual spinoff of Mega Communications' non-core properties; the
    kilowatt daytimer (now with 42 watts at night) goes to Levan
    Communications, which we hear is associated with the former owners
    of crosstown WHAT (1340).  Expect the black-oriented talk that's
    been running on a leased-time basis to continue under WURD's new
    ownership.</p>
        <p>WQBR (99.9 Avis) has been granted its power increase; the
    country station will move its tower slightly to the northeast and
    go up in height, to 570 watts at 321 meters.  Now if we could just
    hear a legal ID there....</p>
        <p>Bible Broadcasting was granted a license to cover last week
    for WYFU (88.5 Masontown), so we'd expect that religious station
    is now on the air.</p>
        <p>And just over the state line, the three-way power increase
    was granted last week for WAKZ (95.9 Sharpsville PA/Youngstown
    OH), WAKS (96.5 Akron OH) and WNPQ (95.9 New Philadelphia
    OH).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a name="CAN" id="CAN">And we'll finish things up in CANADA, where NewCap's new
    CIHT (89.9 Ottawa) is getting ready for a launch Friday afternoon
    as dance/CHR &quot;Planet.&quot; It could soon have company on the AM dial;
    &quot;Fondation Radio Enfant&quot; has applied to revive the 1250 frequency
    (last used by Radio-Canada's CBOF, which moved to 90.7 a decade
    ago) for a French-language children's format, with 1000 watts day,
    100 watts night.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Montreal's CJAD (800) is shuffling its hosts; Andrew Carter
    moves from &quot;The World Today&quot; in the afternoons to the morning
    show, while Ric Peterson takes over afternoons.</p>
        <p>An LPTV in Quebec City?  That's what &quot;Tele-Mag Inc.&quot; wants;
    it's applying for 50 watts (!) on channel 9 for a community
    station there.</p>
        <p>And out in Truro, Nova Scotia, Barry Reid's &quot;Hope FM
    Ministries&quot; wants 50 watts on 98.5 for a Christian contemporary
    station.</p>
