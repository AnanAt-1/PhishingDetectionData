					<p><a name="p1"></a><img src="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/04/24/notebook.jpg" width="123" height="212" border="0" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5" alt="A picture named notebook.jpg"><a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2007/04/24/wired-journo-wont-do-email-interviews-ironic/">Jason Calacanis</a> was contacted by the same reporter who contacted me. I'm mentioned in Jason's post, but somewhere along the line there was a transcription error. I did not offer to do the interview via email, I made a different offer. &nbsp;<a href="#p1"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p2"></a>Here's what I said: "Not generally doing interviews these days. If you have a few questions, send them along, and if I have something to say, I'll write a blog post, which of course you're free to quote. Sorry that's about the best I can do."&nbsp;<a href="#p2"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p3"></a>Like Jason, I have a lot of experience being misquoted, or having comments linked with others, as if there was some back and forth that didn't happen. Or I get used to make a point that the reporter wants to make, and my story gets lost. Often, the reporter's point is that I'm a putz. Why should I work hard to help people do that? Also like Jason, I don't have any trouble getting my ideas out on my own. &nbsp;<a href="#p3"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p4"></a>So if you want to work together, let's find a new way to do it. I'm fed up with the old system. The way we start the reboot is to do all our work out in the open, real-time. Not via email, but in full view of everyone. &nbsp;<a href="#p4"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p5"></a>I will respect the reporter's wish not to be identified, and if they want, I won't even say my comments are in response to an inquiry from a reporter. &nbsp;<a href="#p5"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p6"></a><a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/04/alist_blogger_j.html">Another super-rude comeback</a> from a Wired reporter. And they wonder why we decline to do interviews with them. Look in the mirror guys. Imagine someone talked about you that way, and ask if you'd go out of your way to help them. &nbsp;<a href="#p6"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p7"></a><a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/04/24/interviews-email-or-live/">Dan Gillmor</a>: "Every journalist should have the experience of being covered by journalists. Nothing would improve the craft more."&nbsp;<a href="#p7"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p8"></a><a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/18.html">Joe Beda</a>: "Talking to the media has absolutely no upside for me."&nbsp;<a href="#p8"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p9"></a><a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/2007/04/24/scripting-news-for-4242007/#comment-55317">Kevin Tofel</a>: "How about an interview Wiki?"&nbsp;<a href="#p9"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
<p><a name="p10"></a><a href="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/04/24/ltr070421.gif"><img src="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/04/24/straightLine.gif" width="150" height="44" border="0" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5" alt="A picture named straightLine.gif"></a>Postscript: <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/04/calacanis_wont_.html">A Wired reporter takes issue</a> with Jason's post, calling him "cowardly." As if to prove my point, perhaps. Can't wait to hear what epiphet they have for me. The weird thing about it is that I know and respect Dylan Tweney, which makes me wonder if he's trying to make some kind of really bad joke. If you're trying to be funny, self-deprecating humor works better. Seriously.&nbsp;<a href="#p10"><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" height="9" border="0" alt="Permalink to this paragraph"></a></p>
