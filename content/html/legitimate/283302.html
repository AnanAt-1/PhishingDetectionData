    <td colspan="2"><p>When the United States seized Pacific colonies 
        in 1898, the emerging world power touched off a heated 
        rivalry with another nation feeling newly energized and 
        eager for colonial possessions to prove its standing. 
        Japan saw the American presence in the formerly Spanish 
        Philippines as a threat to its ambitions, and many Japanese 
        took the overthrow of the Queen of Hawai&#8217;i as a 
        direct affront. 
      <p>Simple racism also pushed the conflict. When the Americans 
        brokered a peace deal between Russia and Japan in 1905, 
        some Japanese felt they had been robbed of the fruits 
        of their victory, and that the white Americans had cheated 
        them in order to help the white Russians. In 1907, California 
        passed a set of Jim Crow-style racist laws considered 
        outlandish even by the lax standards of the day, further 
        infuriating the Japanese. What is amazing is not the Japan 
        attacked the United States in 1941, but that they waited 
        so long.

      <p>Japan did not loom nearly so large in the American consciousness, 
        and Americans lacked the same widespread resentment felt 
        by the Japanese. But within the United States Navy, planners 
        saw war with Japan as the most likely future conflict 
        and it was with such a war in mind that the United States 
        built its fleet. When Japan signed an alliance with Britain 
        in 1902, this act only seemed to confirm the Empire&#8217;s 
        hostile intentions. &#8220;Orange,&#8221; the Navy&#8217;s 
        code name for Japan, became the opponent in most war plans 
        from the turn of the century until 1941. Even when the 
        United States was informally allied with Japan in the 
        First World War, American planners talked more about the 
        Japanese than they did the Germans.

      <p><em>Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Orange</em> is based 
        on the war plans the United States hatched for fighting 
        a naval war against Japan in 1930, and the Japanese plans 
        to attack American bases in the Philippines. The Americans 
        believed the Japanese would attack the islands, and a 
        mighty American relief force would then charge across 
        the Pacific to engage the Japanese in battle somewhere 
        nearby. The Japanese had a similar view, though they believed 
        the massive battle might take place closer to Japan.

      <p>While the Americans believed the Philippines to be the 
        object of Japanese desire, the Japanese for their part 
        thought it necessary to deprive the Americans of forward 
        bases there. For purposes of naval operations, either 
        motive served about the same. The Japanese would attack 
        the islands; the Americans would try to hold them and 
        if necessary take them back. These operations are the 
        crux of the operational and tactical scenarios in <em>Plan 
        Orange.</em>

      <p><em>U.S. Navy Plan Orange</em> also contains counters 
        for many ships designed and begun in the early 1920s but 
        cancelled as part of the Washington Naval Treaties of 
        1922 that limited warship construction. Japan and the 
        United States had engaged in a massive arms race, and 
        neither nation could afford to continue it. Japan stopped 
        construction on four battleships and four battle cruisers; 
        the United States cancelled a class of six battleships 
        and four battle cruisers, and scuttled one nearly-complete 
        battleship from an earlier class. In addition, huge numbers 
        of older warships went to the scrapyard. 
      <p>Present in the game are the American <em>Constellation</em>-class 
        battle cruisers and <em>South Dakota</em>-class battleships 
        (huge warships carrying twelve 16-inch guns). Japan has 
        her <em>Tosa</em>-class fast battleships, <em>Amagi</em>-class 
        battle cruisers and <em>Kii</em>-class fast battleships. 
        Early aircraft carriers such as the <em>Hosho</em> and 
        <em>Langley</em> are here, and big converted battle cruisers 
        such as <em>Akagi</em> and <em>Saratoga</em>.

      <p><em>U.S. Navy Plan Orange</em> introduced aircraft rules 
        to the <em>Great War at Sea </em>series, and both sides 
        have land- and carrier-based torpedo planes and fighters. 
        In addition, the Americans have the airships <em>Akron</em> 
        and <em>Macon, </em>each of which carries its own fighter 
        squadron!
