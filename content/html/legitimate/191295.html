Korea and Japan are the leaders in glow-boosting yet non-comedogenic SPF. Still, Bioré’s made-in-Japan <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4j9gBgE\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://amzn.to/4j9gBgE\">Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen Serum SPF 50</a> has been *the* resounding cult favorite for years thanks to its non-greasy, invisible feel and glowy yet poreless finish. Basically, it’s the ultimate sunscreen for people who hate sunscreen. It’s garnered a similar cult-status to the multitasking French pharmacy gem, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3R1b53P\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://amzn.to/3R1b53P\">Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré</a> (iykyk). This formula is touted for being suitable for all skin types, but those of us with oily skin are especially smitten with it because it absorbs into the skin and sets almost instantly upon application. While you can still get the Japanese sunscreen-moisturizer-primer on Amazon, the prices are highly inflated since it’s so difficult to find in the States. Naturally, when Bioré debuted its <a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/YGGYOYYF\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://go.linkby.com/YGGYOYYF\">North American version of the viral beauty product</a>, skincare obsessives took note.

The UV Aqua Rich Sunscreen is strikingly similar to the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/best-everyday-sunscreen-to-protect-your-face-is-biore-uv-watery-essence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/best-everyday-sunscreen-to-protect-your-face-is-biore-uv-watery-essence/\">O.G.

The main difference is that the <a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/YGGYOYYF\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://go.linkby.com/YGGYOYYF\">American formula </a>contains fragrance—a mild but definitely noticeable citrusy scent. So, if you’re looking for a more accessible alternative to the KAO Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen, you won’t be disappointed (unless you’re sensitive or allergic to fragrances, of course).

The <a href=\"https://go.linkby.com/YGGYOYYF\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://go.linkby.com/YGGYOYYF\">formula</a> is best described as a gel-cream hybrid, delivering a dose of hydration to the skin and a finish that strikes the perfect balance between dewy and matte. More impressively, the affordable sunscreen is powered by the brand’s invisible micro-defense technology, which allows its aqua capsules to release moisture upon application, evenly covering the skin’s surface to help prevent UV rays from reaching the skin.

After appearing as villain Brad Whitaker opposite Timothy Dalton in <i>The Living Daylights </i>(1987), Baker returned to the franchise—this time as a good guy—when Pierce Brosnan took on the mantle, portraying CIA Agent Jack Wade in <i>GoldenEye </i>(1995) and <i>Tomorrow Never Dies </i>(1997). Born in 1936 in Groesbeck, Texas, Baker started his career performing on Broadway with New York’s Actor’s Studio and in bit parts in ’60s Westerns like films <i>Cool Hand Luke </i>and <i>Guns of the Magnificent Seven </i>and series <i>Bonanza </i>and <i>Gunsmoke. </i>He continued to play grizzled Southern characters and corrupt former cops in Westerns and crime dramas throughout the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s, including <i>Wild Rovers, The Outfit, Charley Varrick, </i>and <i>Cape Fear</i>.

According to Westerly police, they discovered what seemed to be a human leg bone in the affluent Watch Hill neighborhood, less than a mile from pop sensation Taylor Swift’s home. “It was probably a couple football fields away from Taylor Swift’s house and the Ocean House,” Westerly resident Taylor Day <a href=\"https://turnto10.com/news/local/human-remains-found-westerly-rhode-island-water-everett-avenue-medical-examiner-police-officers-crime-criminal-may-14-2025\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://turnto10.com/news/local/human-remains-found-westerly-rhode-island-water-everett-avenue-medical-examiner-police-officers-crime-criminal-may-14-2025\">told</a> NBC10. Day said she happened to be driving by as police began investigating the scene. “I would never expect anything like that—especially not in Watch Hill,” she said. The remains were brought to the Rhode Island Medical Examiner’s Office to be inspected, and police don’t suspect any foul play.

Some suspect a serial killer is on the loose, though law enforcement have denied these claims. Day said her “mind immediately went to all the theories that are being thrown around,” adding that she tries to “stay out in public and be vigilant.” Swift bought her home in Rhode Island in 2013 while she was dating Conor Kennedy for $17.75 million.","type":"text"}],"copyright":"editorial","created_date":"2025-05-15T16:52:23.508Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"jasmine-venet","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Jasmine Venet","image":{"url":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/0972fff4-4ea7-4245-a3c2-0ae68973b9f1.jpg","version":"0.5.8","type":"image","auth":{"1":"93f096e201cfd43d799c6a01dcc07426efebb0817c371a3a829b26c05b58a08c"}},"description":"Jasmine Venet holds a bachelor's Degree in English Literature and Journalism from NYU.

The birthday celebration could cost as much as $25 million to $45 million in tax payer dollars, depending on if there is a parade, and could include as many as 25 tanks thundering through Washington, D.C., 6,500 troops, and around 150 vehicles and 50 aircraft moving to Washington, according to officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. Those costs reportedly don’t include post-celebration costs that the Beltway would have to bear, including trash pickup and road repairs from the weight of the tanks. Some critics have rebuked the parade as wasteful given the mission of Trump and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Yet the U.S. Army, helmed by Trump ally Pete Hegseth, is already planning to move troops and battle equipment to Washington for the anniversary celebration on June 14.

On Thursday, Dick’s Sporting Goods announced it would acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion. The news comes after both companies began 2025 in rough waters. Though Dick’s generated a record $3.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025, its investors expressed anxieties that Trump’s tariffs would kneecap the footwear economy. In March, shares in Dick’s <a href=\"https://frontofficesports.com/dicks-sporting-goods-investor-concerns-over-tariffs-despite-record-quarter/\" rel=\"\">declined more than 18</a> percent over a month-long period after its sales predictions for 2025 and 2026 showed minimal growth. Foot Locker’s year has been much worse. Despite efforts to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/23/how-foot-locker-is-waging-a-comeback-after-its-breakup-with-nike.html\" rel=\"\">reclaim its onetime sneaker culture dominance through branding,</a> the company’s stocks dropped 41 percent this year after Trump’s tariffs sent consumer confidence plummeting. By merging, Dick’s and Foot Locker may also be mounting a Hail Mary to corner the market on one of both companies’ best-selling commodities: Nike footwear. The companies—two of Nike’s three retail partners, alongside JD Sports—seem to be waging war against the footwear giant’s strategy of reducing its business with retailers in favor of selling directly to consumers through its own website and brick-and-mortar stores. While Foot Locker’s sales continue to drop, experts say Dick’s hopes acquiring the retail chain will help it expand internationally, dominating the “sneaker head” market.

Appearing on co-star Kristin Davis’ podcast <i>Are You A Charlotte?,</i> Parker admitted she tried to “get out” of the role shortly after shooting the pilot. “I talked to my agents and I said, ‘Hey, can you get me out of this?’” said Parker, who later won an Emmy for playing Carrie, starred in two spin-off films, and now leads the reboot, <i>And Just Like That... </i>Parker explained that while she had a “lovely” experience filming the pilot, the thought of committing to a series left her feeling “depressed,” and she “panicked” when the series was picked up by HBO. Though she had appeared in numerous series by the time she filmed <i>Sex and the City,</i> Parker said signing on to a show with no predetermined end date initially felt “oppressive,” as she’d envisioned herself as more of a “journeyman” actor who would juggle multiple roles in theatre, TV, and film. Despite her initial reservations, however, Parker assured her co-star that once they started filming the first season, “There was no place I would rather have been than on our set every single solitary day.”","type":"text"}],"copyright":"editorial","created_date":"2025-05-15T17:12:17.768Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"paulina-rodriguez","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Paulina Rodriguez","image":{"url":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/541c03dd-977d-41b8-9653-084355c6e8b5.jpg","version":"0.5.8","type":"image","auth":{"1":"aab10bf62258d383f51ff1e4076f4480d679acd1f4a318192a51530a0b235b91"}},"description":"","url":"","slug":"paulina-rodriguez","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"paulina.rodriguez@thedailybeast.com"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"paulina.rodriguez@thedailybeast.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"paulina-rodriguez","firstName":"Paulina","lastName":"Rodriguez","byline":"Paulina Rodriguez","role":"Breaking News Intern","image":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/541c03dd-977d-41b8-9653-084355c6e8b5.jpg","email":"paulina.rodriguez@thedailybeast.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"","bio":"","longBio":"Paulina Rodriguez is a writer and reporter from San Antonio, TX, now based in Manhattan.

Granted, much of the firestorm has come from Gronk himself, who, before last night, had publicly spoken out about Hudson three times in the last two weeks. The former Patriots tight end first <a href=\"https://people.com/rob-gronkowski-julian-edelman-defend-jordon-hudson-bill-belichick-interview-uproar-11724973\" rel=\"\">defended</a> the couple in an April 30 episode of his podcast, Dudes on Dudes.

Since 1946, the university thought it only had a copy of the medieval document—which established that kings are not above the law and set out other civic rights—having paid just $27.50 for it after World War II. However, British academics now believe that what is on display at the library is actually an original version dating back to 1215, <i>The New York Times </i>reported. Original copies of the Magna Carta are extremely rare, and until now, it was believed that only six still existed. In 2007, one version of the document from the 1300s sold for $21.3 million. Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at Britain’s University of East Anglia, noted the significance of Harvard finding out about the document as it comes under attack from the Trump administration. “In this particular instance, we are dealing with an institution that is under direct attack from the state itself, so it’s almost providential it has turned up where it has at this particular time,” he told <i>The Times. </i>","type":"text"}],"copyright":"editorial","created_date":"2025-05-15T13:47:17.692Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"ewan-palmer","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Ewan Palmer","image":{"url":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/254c1254-d4a3-4772-992d-04026afbe7f0.png","version":"0.5.8","type":"image","auth":{"1":"6deb58e7aa3c369ed54815e2758bc2ddd0ab43751b5ad63dbff9fc98348a9161"}},"description":"Ewan Palmer is a reporter at The Daily Beast.

23-year-old Mexican beauty influencer was shot and killed at the hair and nail salon where she worked in the city of Zapopan, during a livestream on TikTok. Valeria Márquez, 23, was showing her viewers a small stuffed piglet that had just arrived in the mail when a man entered the salon and shot her. The video was on mute but showed her slumped in her chair after the attack. Police are investigating the shocking death as a possible case of femicide, or the killing of a woman or girl for gender-based reasons. Mexico has long struggled with such killings, which can involve degrading violence, sexual abuse, a relationship with the murderer, or leaving the bodies in public places, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/mexican-beauty-influencer-killed-tiktok\" rel=\"\"><i>The Guardian</i></a> reported.

White South African who was flown into the U.S. as a refugee previously called Jews “untrustworthy” and “dangerous” in his social media posts.

According to The Bulwark, however, Kleinhaus’ posts include several that talk down on Jews. In a <a href=\"https://archive.is/Z7ObG\" rel=\"\">now-deleted post</a> dated April 2023, he wrote: “Jews are untrustworthy and a dangerous group they are not Gods chosen like to believe they are . Where is the Temple that must be their concern leave us alone we all believe in the God of Abraham , Moses and Jacob !
