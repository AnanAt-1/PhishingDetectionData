<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Local historians and football enthusiasts will tell you
that East Fife Football Club were founded in 1903. What is not so well documented,
however, is how the game of football developed in and around Methil prior to East
Fife&#146;s formation. For the first mention of football in the Levenmouth area we must go
back to the year 1879, when Cameron Bridge Football Club came into existence. The club was
formed by a group of local football enthusiasts in March of that year, who organised
matches amongst their own members in the grounds of Cameron House. The playing members of
Cameron Bridge F.C. would appear to have entered into the venture with great enthusiasm,
not content with confining games to Saturday afternoons. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">When the hours of daylight became shorter and the nights became
colder, the games were carried on under the light of the moon! The formation of Cameron
Bridge F.C. did not, however, initiate the immediate formation of other football clubs in
the area. Most of the inhabitants of the towns and villages in the eastern part of the
county were content to play cricket on summer Saturdays and amuse themselves with indoor
pastimes throughout the winter months.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This situation began to change during the mid 1880&#146;s, when
several football clubs started to spring up in the Levenmouth area. Star of Leven and Vale
of Leven (not to be confused with the famous Dumbarton sides of the same name who were
prominent in the early years of the Scottish Cup !) were amongst the first clubs to be
formed in the area. Vale must have been a reasonable side as they included amongst their
victories a win over Hibs&#146; Reserves by four goals to one. Almost all the local
football in those early days was played on Leven Links, and crowds sometimes in excess of
1,000 would assemble to watch the local sides.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">There were no goal nets then and, on at least one
occasion, the local newspaper reported that spectators standing behind the
&#145;home&#146; goal had assisted the Leven goalkeeper by preventing the ball from
crossing the line, whilst spectators at the other end attempted to impede the visiting
goalie! The first Senior football club to be formed in the area was the short lived Leven
F.C. who, along with Raith Rovers, were admitted to the Fifeshire Football Association in
1889. The new side soon built up a reputation - unfortunately not a good one! After a
match at Crail, where Leven had beaten Crail Union 3-1 on Sauchope Links, the local
newspaper commented:</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>&#147;This was not football but rough play. The Union on different
occasions were about to leave the field through the Leven lads using filthy language
towards not only the players but the spectators. The Union are not likely to bring back
this team to Crail in a hurry for the sake of their own good name as well as the game of
football&#148;. </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The draw for the Fife cup in season 1889/90 paired Leven with
Burntisland Thistle, then one of the most respected teams in Fife. The match was to be
played on Leven Links. Again, the newspaper report which followed did nothing to improve
the home side&#146;s already tarnished reputation:</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>&#147;The game throughout was very disagreeable, the Leven players
indulging in a good deal of rough play. The Burntisland team, however, were quite able for
the home club and won by eight goals to four&#148;.</i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">This convincing defeat in their first ever cup tie must
have been too much for the Leven F.C. players and officials, as the team never again took
to the field. After the demise of the Leven club, however, other local sides began to
flourish. Over the decade which followed, three highly respected football clubs were
formed in the Levenmouth area - Methil Rovers, Buckhaven United and Leven Thistle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Methil Rovers were formed in 1893. Their colours were red and white
and their first home was School Park in Lower Methil, which had a bad slope running from
goal to goal. In 1897 Rovers moved to Braehead Park, on the west side of Methil Brae.
Braehead Park was a highly respected venue in local football circles and also attracted
cup finals from west of Fife Associations. The ground had also held over 1,000 spectators
for inter-association matches. In 1898, after almost going out of existence, the club was
renamed Methil Rangers and continued to play at Braehead until the end of season 1900/01.
Rovers&#146; regular opponents included Leven Thistle, Buckhaven United, Anstruther
Rangers, Tayside Albion, Markinch, Kirkcaldy Albion, Cupar Athletic and Binend Rovers.
Methil Rovers also regularly played Raith Athletic, a &#145;nursery club&#146; affiliated
to Raith Rovers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Leven Thistle were founded in the late 1880&#146;s and led a fairly
nomadic existence. Their colours were red and black. The club first played on Leven Links,
then moved to a new ground called Haughhouse around 1895. This was almost certainly at the
south west corner of what is now Leven&#146;s Mountfleurie housing scheme. The park had a
bad slope, which was referred to in match reports as &#145;the hill&#146;. In season
1896/97 Thistle attained the title of &#145;Fife County Champion Juniors&#146;. In 1899
they moved back to Leven Links to play at Links Park, where they attracted a crowd of
1,000 for a match v Lochgelly United Juniors in the semi-final of the Kirkcaldy Cup. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The following season they moved on to Cottage Park,
which was situated near Swiss Cottage on the banks of the River Leven. When Methil Rovers
failed to reappear at the start of the 1901/02 season, Thistle moved in to their ground at
Braehead, Methil, although the team retained its original name. This was to be the
club&#146;s home for only half a season, as they were soon on the move again - this time
to Town Hall Park, Methil, for the start of season 1902/03. The following season, Town
Hall Park was taken over by the newly formed East Fife F.C. and renamed Bayview Park! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Having lost their home ground and facing the likelihood that their
regular patrons would turn their attentions to the new Senior club, Thistle decided to
call it a day. Buckhaven United were first mentioned in local sports columns in 1890, but
had disappeared from the newspaper reports by 1891. The club was reformed in 1897 and
played their first match in September of that year. Their colours were black and white.
United&#146;s short lived first ground was Toll Park, which was built over by Brown&#146;s
Sawmill just a year after the club took up tenancy. They then moved to a new park beside
Wellesley Road, also named Toll Park, which was opened with a friendly against Hearts of
Beath. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">It was during their spell at the second Toll Park, in
1902, that Buckhaven United considered the possibility of becoming a Senior professional
club representing the local area. This prompted the following response from the Leven
Advertiser and Wemyss Gazette: &#147;Some people talk of running a Senior team in
Buckhaven, but older heads view this as beyond the resources of the town itself; they
hold, and rightly we think, that such a team could only be done by amalgamation with
Wemyss or Leven&#148;. By early 1903, local opinion that the Levenmouth area could support
a Senior side was growing almost daily. This enthusiasm resulted in a public meeting being
held in Methil in January 1903 &#147;to discuss the formation of a Senior club for the
East of Fife&#148; - and East Fife Football Club was born. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Unlike Leven Thistle, Buckhaven United did not fold
following the formation of the Senior club. They continued playing until 1912 and actually
played East Fife three times - once at Toll Park and twice at Bayview - with Buckhaven
winning all three games!</font></p>
