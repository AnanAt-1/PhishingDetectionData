<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The PL/I compiler and installation files are contained in the
archive:&nbsp; <a href="../downloads/archives/pli.tgz">pli.tgz</a> [MD5: a19db21b89092c3a5d83d7eebea8b2b8].&nbsp; Click on the archive name to download the
archive to your computer.&nbsp; The archive contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">a HET tape image (pli.het),</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">the output of the mainframe utility TAPEMAP showing the
    contents of the tape image (pli.map),</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">an installation jobstream (mvtpli.jcl),&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">an installation verification jobstream (plitest.jcl), and</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">a jobstream that compiles/links/executes the 99bottles
    program from <a href="https://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/" target="_blank">https://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/</a>
    (99bottles.jcl).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Uncompress the archive (use the tar xvzf pli.tgz command on
Linux or use WinZip or ZipNAll on Windows).&nbsp; The tape image
should go into your tape image subdirectory, the jobstreams should go into your
JCL subdirectory, and the map file may be viewed with a text editor or printed
if you are curious about the contents of the tape image.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; The
jobstreams were created under Windows, so each line is terminated with x'0d0a'.</p>
<p align="left">The PL/I compiler consists of a set of load modules, which are
invoked during the compilation of a user written program, and a set of object
modules, which are used during the link-editing of a compiled program.&nbsp; The
compiler load modules are contained in the first dataset on the tape image
(PL1.LOAD).&nbsp;
The object modules are contained in the second dataset on the tape image
(PL1.LIB).&nbsp;
These two datasets were created by an IEBCOPY unload and the two libraries were
unloaded from 3350 DASD (RECFM=U,BLKSIZE=19069).&nbsp; The third dataset on the
tape image (PL1.PROCS) is a set of Catalogued Procedures, in IEBUPDTE format,
that can be used to invoke the compiler.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Target Libraries</h3>
<p align="left">The load modules for the compiler must be restored to a load
library and the object modules must be restored to a Partitioned Dataset that
will be available to the Linkage Editor.&nbsp; The Catalogued Procedures should
be restored to a procedure library known to JES2 on your system.&nbsp; The
default targets in the installation jobstream are SYS2.LINKLIB (for the load
library), SYS1.PL1LIB (for the PL/I object library), and SYS2.PROCLIB (for the
Procedure Library).&nbsp; If these libraries are not correct for your system,
you must edit the installation jobstream before submitting it and substitute
destination libraries suitable for your configuration.&nbsp; Search for the
comment - &lt;==TARGET - which is contained on each line where a target library
is named.&nbsp; Additionally note that SYS1.PL1LIB is created in step LINK004
and changes to the UNIT and VOL=SER parameters may be required to conform to
your configuration.</p>
<p align="left">The installation jobstream reloads the unloaded libraries to
temporary datasets and the re-links the contents to the target libraries.&nbsp;
This allows you to place the restored modules on the type of DASD that fits your
configuration, rather than restrict the destination to 3350 DASD.&nbsp; However,
you must have 3350 work space available in your configuration to restore the
datasets to during the installation.</p>
<p align="left">When you have verified that the installation jobstream -
mvtpli.jcl - conforms to your configuration, mount the tape image on a tape
device and submit the jobstream to MVS for execution.&nbsp; The job should take
about two minutes to execute and the return codes expected for the steps
are:</p>

<h3 align="left">Installation Verification Jobstream</h3>
<p align="left">The plitest.jcl jobstream performs a compile, link, and execute
of a simple PL/I program to print the phrase &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; on the
printer.&nbsp; The complete JES2 output for this job may be viewed at <a href="plitest.htm" target="_blank">plitest</a>.</p>
<p align="left">After the compiler has been successfully installed and verified,
you do not need to retain the installation jobstreams or the tape image on your
host computer.</p>
