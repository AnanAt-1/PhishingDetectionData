New  York  Belting  &amp;  Packing  Co. 


Limited. 


Xbe  New  York  Belting  &amp;  Pacfcinjr  Co.,  Limited,  15  Park  Row,  are 
the  pioneers  in  the  manufacture  of  Mechanical  Rubber  Goods.  The  business  was  established 
at  Boston,  Mass.,  in  1846,  soon  after  the  world-famous  process  of  vulcanizing  india  rubber 
was  patented  by  Charles  Goodyear,  and  from  the  outset  the  Company  was  favored  with  the 
great  inventor's  advice  and  co-operation.  After  a  period  of  success  in  Boston,  the  business 
was  moved  to  New  York  to  secure  the  advantages  offered  by  the  metropolis.  Several  large 
factories  are  operated  by  the  concern,  two  at  Newtown,  Conn.,  where  a  valuable  water- 
power  is  owned,  and  a  still  more  extensive  plant  at  Passaic,  N.  J.  The  wheels  of  all  these 
factories  are  kept  busy  turning  out  the  very  highest  grade  of  belting,  packing,  hose  of  all 
kinds,  mats,  tubing,  bicycle  tires,  minor  articles,  and  a  widely  known  specialty,  made  by 
them  exclusively,  the  Vulcanite  Emery  Wheel,  the  safest  fast-running  emery  wheel  known. 
A  new  bicycle  tire  of  great  merit,  called  "  The  League  Tire,"  which  has  just  been  placed  on 
the  market,  is  meeting  with  pronounced  success. 

The  growth  of  this  Company's  business  has  been  steady  and  sure,  keeping  pace  with  the 
development  of  the  rubber  industry,  until  at  the  present  day  their  sales  exceed  those  of  any 
other  individual  concern.  Every  improvement  in  modes  of  manufacture  has  been  adopted, 
and  the  high  standard  of  quality  consistently  maintained  has  given  to  their  products  a  repu- 
tation unexcelled  the  whole  world  over.  Large  quantities  of  goods  are  exported  to  various 
countries,  in  all  of  which  their  name  is  a  guarantee  of  the  highest  excellence. 

While  the  Company  are  pioneers  in  the  line,  they  have  also  occupied  the  position  of 
leaders  both  in  quality  and  quantity  of  business  transacted,  hence  the  propriety  of  the  phrase 
which  always  accompanies  their  announcements — "  Pioneers  and  Leaders." 

The  salesrooms,  at  15  Park  Row,  are  directly  opposite  the  Post-Office  and  the  Astor  House.

LIBERTY    ENLIGHTENING   THE   WORLD. 

STATUE,    BY    BARTHOLDI,    ON    BEDLOE'S    ISLAND,    NEW-YORK    HARBOR. 


The  Standard  History 
of  the  Metropolis.  .•  .- 

THE  Mayor  of  New  York  City  having  read  Dr.  Parkhurst's  letter 
commending  Mrs.  Martha  J.  Lamb's  admirable  "  History  of 
the  City  of  New  York,"  wrote  to  the  publishers,  Messrs.  A.  S.  Barnes 
&amp;  Co.,  that  he  heartily  endorsed  Dr.  Parkhurst's  opinion  of  the 
book,  a  copy  of  which  he  possessed.  Dr.  Parkhurst  said  that  the 
History  has  no  rival.  No  work  even  approaches  it  as  a  text-book  of 
information  as  to  the  history  of  the  city.  He  hopes  that  all  citizens 
will  own  a  copy  of  the  work,  so  that  they  may  the  more  intelligently 
comprehend  what  a  responsibility  rests  upon  them  to  treasure  and 
guard  its  interests.  In  order  that  Dr.  Parkhurst's  hopes  may  be 
the  better  realized,  the  publishers  reduced  the  price  from  $20.00  to 
$16.00.  (Two  volumes,  royal  octavo,  1620  pages,  313  illustrations, 
cloth,  gilt  top.)  People  not  New-Yorkers,  but  interested  in  the 
story  of  the  Metropolis,  will  be  glad  to  have  this  superb  work  in 
their  libraries. 

OTHER    TESTIMONIALS. 


The  late  historian,  George  Bancroft, 
wrote  :  "  Mrs.  Lamb's  is,  in  my  view,  by 
far  the  best  history  of  the  City  of  New 
York." 

The  late  distinguished  Hon.  George 
William  Curtis  wrote:  "It  is  rich  with 
information,  and  the  interesting  story  was 
never  so  thoroughly  and  satisfactorily  told." 

The  poet,  Stedman,  writes  :  "  It  is  abso- 
lutely sure  of  a  reading  and  a  reputation  in 
the  distant  future." 

"  A  piece  of  historical  painting  which  for 
brightness  of  color,  distinctness  of  outline 
and  general  truthfulness  of  detail,  deserves 
the  highest  commendation."  —  Harper's 
Magazine. 


"Mrs.  Lamb's  work  is  built  on  a  solid 
foundation  which  guarantees  to  it  a  secure 
place  in  the  historical  collections  of  the 
age." — Tribune,  N.  Y. 

"  Mrs.  Lamb's  '  History  of  New  York 
City  '  should  be  in  the  library  of  every  old 
New-Yorker."— Sun,  N.  Y. 

"As  to  all  that  belongs  to  the  past  this 
record  offers  a  mine  of  varied,  interesting 
and  authentic  information  indispensable  to 
the  student."—  The  Nation. 

"  It  will  be  a  desirable  addition  to  private 
and  public  libraries  in  all  parts  of  the 
country."— Chicago  Tribune. 

"  It  was  full  time  that  a  faithful  picture 
of  New  York  should  be  written.  Mrs. 
Lamb's  style  is  pleasant  and  remarkably 
concise." — London  Academy.

Their  workmanship  is  particularly  satisfactory,  and 
their  general  business  methods  are  very  pleasing.  This 
great  concern  is  always  crowded  with  work  from  all 
parts  of  the  country — a  very  natural  result  of  the  skill 
and  facilities,  the  promptness  and  stability,  the  moderate 
charges  and  general  business-like  methods. 

They  are  in  every  way  worthy  of  the  highest  com- 
mendation.

MORE  THAN   THREE    MILLION    PASSENGERS. 


THE  NORTH-GERMAN  LLOYD  STEAMSHIP  COM- 
PANY is  the  largest  steamship  corporation  in  the  world  ;  and  has 
run  steamships  to  and  from  New  York  ever  since  1857,  enjoying 
its  full  share  of  the  best  American  patronage.  Besides  its  Bremen- 
Southampton-New  York  service  it  operates  lines  from  New  York 
to  the  Mediterranean,  from  Bremen  to  Australia,  China,  Japan, 
New  Guinea,  South  America,  and  virtually  covers  both  conti- 
nents. Its  tonnage  is  301,673;  its  number  of  vessels,  78;  and  to 
the  close  of  1893  it  had  carried  upwards  of  three  million  passen- 
gers. In  equipment  and  service  there  is  no  superior  line  at  home 
or  abroad.  The  North-German  Lloyd  Steamers  stop  at  South- 
ampton to  accommodate  passengers  from  and  to  London  and 
Paris.  Its  Mediterranean  service  has  been  an  increasing  success 
from  its  inception.

John  Osborn,  Son  &amp;  Co. 


A    RECORD    OF   SIXTY    YEARS. 


[Sketch  from  "KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY."] 

JOHN  OSBORN,  SON  &amp;  CO.,  general  merchants,  have  offices  at  45  Beaver  Street. 
The  house  is  a  very  old  one.  John  Osborn  came  to  New  York  from  Oporto,  where 
he  had  a  commercial  house,  and  established  himself  in  January,  1836.  Some  years 
later  he  took  his  brother  Robert  into  partnership,  under  the  style  of  John  and  Robert 
Osborn;  the  place  of  business  being  at  in  Wall  Street.  In  1854  John  Osborn  erected 
the  building  which  they  now  occupy,  then  in  the  center  of  the  dry-goods  trade.  A  year 
or  so  later  the  trade  began  moving  farther  up  town.  About  1856  the  firm  removed  to 
45  Beaver  Street,  and  a  year  later  the  firm  was  dissolved  by  the  death  of  Robert.  John 
Osborn  continued  under  his  own  name.  In  April,  1869,  he  associated  with  himself  his 
son,  Francis  Pares  Osborn,  and  Timothy  Stevens,  under  the  co-partnership  name  of  John 
Osborn,  Son  &amp;  Co.  The  firm  had  business  relations  with  foreign  countries  (partic- 
ularly with  Great  Britain,  France,  Spain  and  Portugal),  and  continued  until  May  16,  1869, 
when  it  was  dissolved  by  the  death  of  John  Osborn.  Immediately  a  co-partnership  was 
formed  by  Francis  Pares  Osborn,  Timothy  Stevens  and  Mary  C.  Osborn,  to  contiune  the 
business  under  the  same  style.  There  was  no  change  in  the  "personnel"  until  May  i, 
1875,  when  the  co-partnership  was  dissolved.  Then  a  limited  partnership  was  formed  by 
Francis  Pares  Osborn  as  general,  and  Mary  C.  Osborn  as  special  partner,  to  continue  the 
business  under  the  name  of  John  Osborn,  Son  &amp;  Co.  In  1876  a  branch  house  was  opened 
in  Montreal,  the  head  office  remaining  in  New  York.  On  January  i,  1884,  a  new  limited 
partnership  was  formed  between  Francis  Pares  Osborn,  Charles  Spencer  Osborn,  William 
Osborn,  Robert  A.  Osborn,  and  Mary  C.  Osborn,  to  continue  four  years  under  the  same 
name.  This  partnership  was  renewed  in  January,  1888.  On  December  28,  1891,  Mary  C. 
Osborn,  the  special  partner  and  mother  of  the  general  partners,  died  at  her  home  on 
Clinton  Avenue,  Brooklyn,  where  she  had  lived  for  forty-two  years,  and  which  was  the 
birth-place  of  William  and  Robert  A.  Osborn.  On  March  13,  1892,  the  senior  partner, 
Francis  Pares  Osborn,  died;  the  firm,  however,  being  a  limited  partnership,  continued. 
In  May,  1892,  the  firm  established  a  Western  Department,  with  offices  at  522  and  523 
Monadnock  Block,  Chicago.  On  December  31,  1892,  a  new  firm  was  formed  under  a 
general  partnership,  composed  of  the  remaining  partners,  Charles  Spencer  Osborn,  William 
Osborn,  and  Robert  A.  Osborn,  under  the  same  style  of  heretofore.  On  May  i,  1893, 
owing  to  increasing  business  in  the  Western  Department,  and  to  offer  better  facilities  to 
all  friends  who  might  visit  the  World's  Columbian  Exposition,  the  Western  Department 
removed  their  offices  to  the  Auditorium  Hotel  Building,  on  Michigan  Avenue,  where  they 
have  large  and  spacious  offices  on  the  ground  floor,  giving  them  better  accommodations 
to  do  their  increasing  business,  which  is  making  Chicago  the  distributing  point  of  the 
West;  also  in  1893  the  firm  opened  an  office  in  Philadelphia.  On  November  15,  1894,  Charles 
Spencer  Osbcrn  retired  from  the  firm.  Among  the  agencies  which  this  firm  has  control  of 
in  its  wine  and  spirit  department  is  that  of  the  old  and  well-known  brand  of  Piper-Heidsieck 
Champagne.  For  years  they  have  imported  only  one  grade  of  Champagne,  namely  Piper- 
Heidsieck,  "Sec,"  but  this  year,  considering  that  American  connoisseurs  are  demanding 
also  a  Brut  wine,  they  have  been  induced  to  import  a  real  Brut,  known  under  the  name  of 
Pieper-Heidsieck,  Brut  Extra,  which  is  pronounced  the  highest  grade  of  real  Brut  that  is 
known  on  this  market.  During  the  many  years  which  this  firm  has  been  in  existence  it  has 
had  business  relations  with  all  parts  of  Europe,  the  South  American  Republics,  and  the 
West  Indies,  importing  and  exporting  the  products  of  these  countries,  as  well  as  doing  a 
banking  business ;  and  the  reputation  and  high  standing  of  the  house  are  well-known 
throughout  the  world.

THE   CUTLER   PATENT   MAILING   SYSTEM 


Or  U.  S.  Mail  Chute,  has  become  a  necessity  in  office  buildings, 
hotels  and  apartment  houses.  Installed  in  such  buildings  under 
explicit  authorization  and  a  special  order  of  the  Postmaster 
General,  making  the  Mail  Chute  a  part  of  the  receiving  box, 
etc.,  it  is  an  integral  and  most  valuable  part  of  the  postal  system, 

available  not  only  for  correspondence 
but  for  the  service  of  legal  papers 
which  can  be  mailed.  Limited  in  its 
use  to  such  structures  as  are  arranged 
so  as  to  comply  with  the  necessarily 
stringent  regulations  of  the  Post  Office 
Department,  and  in  locations  where 
the  additional  collections  are  possible 
with  the  carriers  available,  the  system 
can  be  offered  only  subject  to  official 
approval.  This  apparatus  may  be  said 
to  have  revolutionized  the  collection 
service,  as  it  is  in  general  use  in  more 
than  one  hundred  cities  of  the  United 
States,  and  in  the  City  of  New  York 
alone  in  about  one  hundred  of  the 
representative  buildings.  Among  these 
are  the  Manhattan,  Equitable,  Mutual 
Life,  Metropolitan  and  others  of  the 
great  insurance  buildings ;  the  Waldorf, 
Holland,  Fifth  Avenue  and  many  others 
of  the  leading  hotels. 

The  Elevator  made  high  buildings 
possible — the  Cutler  Patent  Mailing 
System  has  enabled  the  Post  Office 
Department  to  collect  their  mail.  It  is 
manufactured  under  the  Cutler  series  of  patents  exclusively  by 
The  Cutler  Manufacturing  Company  of  Rochester,  N.  Y.,  to  whom 
those  interested  will  do  well  to  apply  for  further  information.

BoSTOM 


FOR    MORE   THAN    HALF   A    CENTURY, 

TrfE    OLD    UNITED    STATES    HOTEL, 

OF    BOSTON, 

has  maintained  its  RESPECTABILITY  AND  EXCELLENCE. 

Originally  the  largest  Hotel  in  Boston,  it  has  been  twice 
enlarged  years  ago,  by  the  extensive  wings  on  Kingston  and 
Lincoln  Streets,  named  respectively  Oregon  and  Texas. 

During  the  past  five  years  it  has  been  under  the  management  of 
Mr.    TILLY    HAYNES,    of    Springfield,  Mass. 

who  has  completely  renovated,  enlarged  and  improved  the  prop- 
erty, and  last  year  added  still  another  hundred  rooms,  by  building 
across  from  Texas  to  Oregon. 

Think  of  a  Hotel  from  Texas  to  Oregon,  and  you  will  understand 
why  this  notice  is  written,  which  is  to  say  that  the  UNITED 
STATES  recommends  itself  for  its  quiet,  orderly  management,  and 
the  notable  character  of  its  guests,  its  numerous  public  rooms  and 
grand  old  parlors,  broad  halls  and  numerous  stairways,  while  none 
of  its  500  Guest  Rooms  are  above  the  fourth  floor. 

These,    with    its    very    central    location,   its    most    excellent 
\  j  table,  and  moderate  charges,  recommend  it  to  all   who 

fy  have  once  shared  its  hospitality.

A  SUGGESTION 

TO 

EVERY 

NEW  YORKER 

When  a  visitor  from  any  city,  especially  from  abroad,  comes  to  your  office 
or  to  your  residence  present  him,  with  your  compliments  written  in  the  front, 
with  a  copy  of  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY." 

Its  cost  to  you  is  a  mere  trifle,  but  the  recipient  will  appreciate  it  for  a 
lifetime. 

While  your  guest  he  will  look  over  it  and  gain  more  information  and  in- 
terest in  your  city  than  you  can  take  time  to  give  him  in  several  hours. 

When  he  has  gone  home  he  has  an  exhaustive  souvenir  of  everything  that 
he  saw,  and  all  that  he  failed  to  see,  while  on  his  visit. 

Imagine  yourself  in  London,  or  Paris,  or  Yokohama,  and  a  friend  kindly 
gave  a  book  with  1029  pictures  showing  every  important  feature  of  every  kind 
within  its  borders,  embodied  in  1008  pages  of  text  interestingly  and  thoroughly 
describing  every  phase  of  the  city's  life  and  its  institutions,  could  you  fail  to 
be  gratified  ?  All  this  is  found  in  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK,"  and 
besides  its  arrangement  by  topics  in  thirty  chapters,  it  has  at  its  close  an  elab- 
orate detailed  index  of  72  columns  with  about  5000  distinct  references. 

And  besides  the  gratification  and  appreciation  of  your  guest  or  visitor, 
every  New  Yorker  can  find  in  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  "  enough  to  make  him 
feel  proud  of  the  city  within  which  he  resides  and  of  which  he  is  a  part. 

No  other  city  in  America  and  only  a  few  cities  in  the  world  can  make  the 
showing  that  New  York  can. 

No  city  in  the  world  has  ever  been  so  minutely  described  and  so  thoroughly 
illustrated  as  has  New  York  in  this  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK."

"  There  is  nothing  which  has  yet  been  contrived  by  man  by  which  as  much

The  first  section  of  this  book  con- 
tains illustrated  announcements  and 
descriptions  of  400  interesting  and 
famous  hotels,  in  almost  every  country 
of  the  world.  Most  of  these  are  ac- 
companied with  pictures  of  the  hotels. 

The  second  section  of  this  book  is 
made  up  of  a  singularly  interesting 


list  of  3000  notable  hotels  on  all  the 
continents,  adding  also  the  populations 
of  the  cities,  from  latest  censuses,  and 
other  practical  notes,  including  the 
rates  at  the  hotels.  This  is  the  most 
comprehensive,  important  and  valu- 
able list  of  hotels  ever  made,  and  will 
be  of  great  value  to  travelers,  and  of 
peculiar  attractiveness  to  others.

May  sigh  to  think  he  still  has  found

THE  UNITED  STATES  BRANCH  BANK  CORNER-STONE, 

SACREDLY  GUARDED   BY 

THE    NEW   YORK    LIFE    INSURANCE   AND   TRUST  COMPANY, 

NO.    52  WALL  STREET. 

NOTE.— In  the  Directors'  Room  of  the  New  York  Life  Insurance  &amp;  Trust  Co.  in  the  white  marble  building, 
No.  52  Wall  Street,  there  is,  in  an  excellent  state  of  preservation,  the  corner-stone  of  the  once  powerful  United 
States  Branch  Bank,  which  formerly  occupied  this  site.  The  great  institution  which  owns  and  guards  this  corner- 
stone is  virtually  the  oldest  and  strongest  of  the  Life  Insurance  and  Trust  Companies,  so  many  of  which  have  be- 
gun and  prospered  since  this  Company  was  chartered  in  1830.  Its  first  President  was  William  Bard,  an  enthusias- 
tic advocate  of  life  insurance  and  also  of  corporate,  in  place  of  individual  power  of  trusts,  annuities  and  other 
kindred  interests.  This  Company  declines  all  corporation  or  other  public  trusts,  and  accepts  only  private  trusts 
created  by  will  or  otherwise,  grants  annuities,  manages  property  as  agent  for  owners,  allows  interest  on  deposits, 
and  is  a  legal  depository  for  executors,  trustees,  and  money  in  suit.  The  officers  are 

President,  HENRY  PARISH,  Secretary,  HENRY  PARISH,  JR., 

Second  Vice-President,  WALTER  KERR,  Assistant  Secretary,  GEORGE  M.  CORNING.

TEXT  versus  NO  TEXT 


THIS  and  ANOTHER. 


THIS  BOOK,  "KING'S  PHOTOGRAPHIC  VIEWS  OF  NEW  YORK," 
has  no  descriptive  text,  but 

ANOTHER  BOOK,  '•  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY," 
has  1008  pages  of  carefully  prepared  text,  minutely  describ- 
ing the  whole  city,  bringing  before  the  reader,  in  words  and 
pictures,  the  story  of  the  great  Metropolis. 

IF    THIS    BOOK  pleases  you  by  reason  of  its  pictures, 

THEN  THE  OTHER  BOOK  will  also  please  you,  for  in 
"KING'S  HANDBOOK  "you  get  1029  illustrations,  besides  its 
1008  pages  of  text. 

YOU  SEE  THIS  BOOK  is  worthy  of  a  life  long  preservation, 
for  its  pictures  of  to-day  become  of  great  value  as  the 
never-ceasing  changes  are  taking  place,  and  yet  it  is  of  no 
such  value  as  "KING'S  HANDBOOK." 

NOW  SEND  FOR  THE  OTHER,  for  when  you  see  it  you 
will  never  part  with  it  for  anything  like  its  cost.  It  is 
worth  its  cost  at  a  single  evening's  entertainment,  when  you 
are  alone  or  when  you  have  company  to  entertain.  It  has 
a  great  value  for  the  present  and  a  still  greater  value  for 
the  future.

The  Imperial  Insurance  Co.  Limited,  of  London 


The  Imperial  Insurance  Company,  Limited,  of  London,  England,  is  one 
of  those  old  and  staunch  foreign  corporations  which  have  become  an  absolute 
necessity  for  the  protection  of  losses  against  fire  in  this  country.  The  Im- 
perial is  over  ninety  years  old,  having  been  instituted  in  1803.  It  is,  with  a  sin- 
gle exception,  the  largest  purely  fire-insurance  company  in  Great  Britain  ;  and, 
without  any  exception,  it  has  the  larges-t  net  surplus  of  any  English  insurance 
company  doing  a  fire  business.  At  home  it  is  esteemed  as  one  of  the  strongest 
and  most  successful  of  the  insurance  corporations.  In  this  country,  since  its 
establishment  in  1868,  when  it  opened  its  office  in  New  York,  it  has  made  a 
record  which  places  the  United  States  branch  on  an  equal  footing  with  the 
best  American  companies.  In  this  country  its  gross  assets  are  $1,847,271, 
which  includes  the  reserve  of  $905,078  for  unearned  premiums,  $[41,931  for 
unsettled  losses,  and  $37,458  for  all  other  claims,  leaving  a  net  surplus  in  the 
United  States  of  $762,804.  It  has  paid  the  colossal  sum  of  $65,000,000  fcr 
losses. 

The  General  Manager  of  the  company  is  Edward  Cozens-Smith,  who  has 
been  at  the  head  of  the  company's  affairs  for  over  twenty  years.  The 
managers  of  the  Metropolitan  District  are  J.  J.  Courtney  and  John  R. 
McCay,  a  firm  composed  of  two  experienced  and  energetic  underwriters. 
Mr.  Courtney  has  been  connected  with  the  Imperial  for  twenty-nine  years, 
eighteen  of  which  were  spent  at  the  company's  head-offices  in  London.  Mr. 
McCay  has  been  the  representative  of  the  Phoenix  Insurance  Company  of 
Hartford  for  twenty  years. 

Besides  having  the  management  of  the  Metropolitan  District  for  the 
Imperial  they  are  also  managers  of  the  New  England  and  Middle  States 
department  of  this  company.  They  also  have  the  management  for  the 
Metropolitan  District  of  the  old  Phoenix  of  Hartford,  one  of  the  staunchest  of 
the  American  insurance  companies,  and  also  of  the  Lion  Insurance  Company 
of  England,  another  of  the  great  English  fire  corporations.  Their  offices  are 
in  the  Imperial  Building,  at  31  and  33  Pine  Street,  a  six-story,  marble-front 
office-building  owned  by  the  Imperial  Insurance  Company,  and  well  situated 
in  what  is  regarded  now  as  the  insurance  district.  The  trustees  of  the 
Imperial  in  the  United  States  are  Henry  W.  Cannon,  President  of  the  Chase 
National  Bank;  W.  A.  Read  of  the  Banking  House  of  Vermilye  &amp;  Co.,  and 
R.  L.  Edwards,  President  of  the  Bank  of  the  State  of  New  York. 

The  Imperial  has,  besides  those  mentioned  above,  the  following  depart- 
ments, viz.:  Boston,  John  C.  Paige,  Manager;  Chicago,  Daniel  C.  Osmun, 
Manager;  Atlanta,  J.  T.  Dargan,  Manager;  San  Francisco,  W.  J.  Landers, 
Manager,  and  representatives  in  every  nook  and  corner  of  the  United  States, 
and  throughout  the  civilized  world.

The  Northern  Assurance  Co. 

OF  LONDON,  ENGLAND. 


[A  Sketch  from  "KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK."] 

The  Northern  Assurance  Company,  of  London,  England,  whose 
principal  United-States  office  is  at  38  Pine  Street,  New  York,  was  organized 
in  1836,  and  commenced  business  the  same  year.  Its  head-offices  are  in 
London,  England,  and  in  Aberdeen,  Scotland.  One  of  the  largest  and 
strongest  among  the  older  British  companies,  it  does  business  in  all  the 
civilized  portions  of  the  world,  and  is  noted  for  its  careful  and  successful 
management.  The  marvellous  growth  of  the  company  appears  in  the  record 
of  its  fire-premiums,  which  were  $4,500,  in  1836  ;  $14,500,  in  1840  ;  $19,000,  in 
1845  ;  $40,000,  in  1850;  $276,500,  in  1855;  $607,000,  in  1860;  $820,000,  in  1865; 
$1,068,000,  in  1870;  $1,756,500,  in  1875;  $2,223,000,  in  1880;  $2,886,500,  in 
1885  ;  and  $3,581,534,  in  1893.  In  Great  Britain  the  company  does  a  fire  and 
life-insurance  business.  In  the  United  States  its  business  is  restricted  to  fire- 
insurance  only.  Its  United-States  assets,  December  31,  1893,  were  $1,657,090; 
unpaid  losses,  unearned  premiums,  and  all  actual  and  contingent  liabilities, 
$1,216,618.  The  company  has,  specially  deposited  with  the  Insurance 
Departments  of  the  several  States,  and  with  trustees  in  New  York,  securities 
to  the  value  of  $1,350,404,  none  of  which  it  may  withdraw  or  remove  while  it 
has  any  existing  liability  in  the  United  States.  Since  its  organization  the 
company  has  received  in  fire-premiums  alone,  $68,078,200;  and  paid  in  fire- 
losses  alone,  $40,255,246.  It  is  represented  in  nearly  all  the  States,  cities, 
principal  towns  and  villages  of  the  United  States  and  Canada.  Its  territory  in 
the  United  States  is  divided  into  four  departments:  The  New-York,  Middle- 
States  and  Southern  Department,  the  head-office  of  which  is  at  38  Pine  Street. 
New  York,  and  the  Manager,  George  W.  Babb,  Jr.;  the  New-England 
Department,  the  head-office  of  which  is  at  27  Kilby  Street,  Boston,  and  the 
Manager,  Howard  S.  Wheelock  ;  the  Western  Department,  the  head-office  of 
which  is  in  Monadnock  Block,  Chicago,  and  the  Manager,  G.  H.  Lermit ;  and 
the  Pacific-Coast  Department,  the  head-office  of  which  is  in  San  Francisco,  and 
the  Manager,  George  F.  Grant.  The  growth  of  the  company  has  been  steady 
and  uninterrupted.  It  has  established  a  fire  fund  co-extensive  with  its  net 
surplus,  to  meet  extraordinary  conflagrations.  No  conflagration  which  can  be 
considered  possible  could  retard  for  a  single  hour  the  operations  of  the 
Northern  Assurance  Company.  Its  accommodations  to  its  policy-holders,  and 
its  equitable  and  prompt  adjustment  of  losses,  have  made  it  popular  with  its 
customers  and  agents.  Its  vast  resources  furnish  certain  indemnity.  The  cut 
on  opposite  page  represents  the  Northern's  graceful  stone  building,  in  New 
York,  completed  in  1889,  and  entirely  occupied  for  its  own  use.  It  is  at  the 
heart  of  the  "insurance  district."

THIS  grand  work  touches  high-water  mark  in  its  scores  of  maps,  its  hun- 
dreds of  pages,  its  thousands  of  pictures  ;  and  all  of  an  excellence  so  rare 
and  at  a  price  so  low  as  to  astonish  and  delight  everyone.    Its  issue  marks 
an  Era  in  Bookmaking.     You  have  never  seen  a  work  at  all  like  it.    You  may 
have  seen  works  somewhat  like  parts  of  this  ;  but  THIS  is  THE  WHOLE  !     It 
is  the  only  book  in   existence  which  tells  what  our  great  country  is  to-day. 
Indeed,  its  title  might  well  be — 

Our  Country!  Its  Founding,  Growth  and  Glory! 

The  Chapter  on  each  State  and  Territory  was  either  written  or  revised  by  Au- 
thorities, men  most  prominent  in  governmental  or  educational  affairs.  Every- 
thing was  prepared  with  the  greatest  care.  It  has  the  hearty  endorsements  of 
the  chief  men  of  every  State  and  Territory.  It  is  full,  from  cover  to  cover,  of 
interest  and  information.  Every  one  of  its  940  pages  teems  with  glowing  facts 
about  our  wonderful  land.  It  is  at  one  time  and  under  one  cover — 

A  HISTORY  of  the  Discovery,  Settlement,  Growth  and  Present  Grandeur 
of  every  Commonwealth.  Crisp  and  charming. 

AN  ATLAS.  Geographic  gems  of  every  State  and  Territory.  Unsur- 
passed in  accuracy  and  beauty. 

AN  ALBUM.  Over  2600  Pearls  of  Pictures  !  The  Art  of  Printing  at 
this  time  permits  no  finer  presswork. 

A  CYCLOPEDIA  of  Government,  Population,  Finance,  Manufactures, 
Education,  Climate — just  what,  and  only  what,  you  really  need  to  know. 

A  REFERENCE  WORK.  A  marvel  of  System  and  Condensation. 
Arranged  Alphabetically  and  also  Double  Indexed.

A  FEW  OPINIONS. 


"Mr.  Moses  King  deserves  the  undying  gratitude 
of  the  citizens  of  New  York,  and  in  fact  of  all  persons 
who  are  interested  in  the  prosperity  of  the  greal 
metropolis  of  the  United  States."— Illustrated  Lon- 
don News,  London,  England. 

"It  is  without  a  rival."—  The  Evening  Post  New 
York. 

"It  keeps  pace  with  the  march  of  improvement 
even  in  busy  New  York."— Public  Ledger,  Philadel- 
phia. 

"Mr.  Moses  King  is  the  handbook  maker  of  the 
United  States,  and  whatever  he  undertakes  is  sure 
to  be  done  well."—  The  Boston  Herald,  Boston. 

"Not  a  dry  page  in  the  entire  book."— Bujffal*. 
Enquirer,  Buffalo. 

"A  book  that  reflects  credit  on  New  York  as  well 
as  on  its  author  and  publisher."—  Enquirer.  Cincin- 
nati. 

"Illustrated  with  a  thousand  reproductions  of 
photographs,  made  especially  for  it,  in  which  all  the 
mechanical  features  are  irreproachable.  The  thor- 
oughness of  the  information,  the  multiplicity  of  facts 
and  figures,  not  easily  accessible  elsewhere,  and 
the  order  and  minute  accuracy  displayed  in  the  edit- 
ing may  well  amaze  one.'- — Chicago  Herald,Chica.go. 

"It  makes  one  feel  in  touch  with  the  subtle  in- 
fluences which  go  to  make  New  York  the  metropolis 
of  America."— Painting  and  Decorating,  Philadel- 
phia. 

"  A  single  reference  led  to  a  perusal  of  the  book 
which  occupied  fully  two  hours.  We  need  hardly 
say  it  was  time  well  spent."— Insurance  Age.  New 
York. 

"  The  original  text  was  the  painstaking  work  of 
many  well-known  v/rilers."—iratc/i&gt;nan,  Boston. 

"  As  we  advise  every  man  to  read  up  on  physi- 
ology and  •  know  thyself,'  so  we  may  even  say  to  the 
resident  of  New  York,  buy  King's  Handbook  and 
know  thy  city.'  —Dr.  Footers  Health  Monthly,  New 
York. 

"  The  historical  chapter,  containing,  as  it  doe=;, 
reproductions  of  early  maps  and  surveys,  is  in  itself 
worth  the  price.'' — Business,  New  York 

''  Lifted  above  the  level  of  the  directory  or  guide 
book  into  the  literary  region  without  in  any  degree 
impairing  its  practical  value."— Free  Press,  Detroit. 

"  This  is  a  remarkable  and  exhaustive  account  of 
the  great  metropolis.  It  gives  a  history  of  the  past 
and  is  a  minute  guide  book  to  the  present  city,  hav- 
ing over  one  thousand  illustrations  taken  from  pho- 
tographs made  expressly  for  this  work.  No  object 
of  interest  is  passed  by.  It  is  a  wonderful  book,  as 
the  growth  of  the  city  is  itself  a  marvel."— Charles- 
ton (S.  C.)  News,  South  Carolina. 


Co!.  Robert  G.  Ingersoll  says  : 

"Your  Handbook  of  New  York  is  the  best  I   ever 
saw  of  its  kind.    It  is  good  enough  for  anybody  and 
cheap    enough   for  everybody.     Every   New  Yorker 
ought  to  have  a  copy." 
Oliver  Wendell  Holmes  says  : 

"  Tour  remarkable  volume,  '  New  York  City.'  It 
is  remarkable  in  many  ways — for  the  vast  amount  of 
matter  it  contains,  especially  for  the  great  number  of 
excellent  illustrations,  and  for  the  surprising  reve- 
lations of  the  architectural  wonders  of  the  great 
city." 
Chauncey  M.  Depew  says: 

"I  have  looked  over  it  with  great  interest.    It  is 
the  most  valuable  and  comprehensive  publication  of 
the  kind  which  I  know  of." 
President  Eliot,  of  Harvard,  says  : 

"I  have  placed  it  in  the  college  library.    There  is 
a  great  wealth  of  illustration." 
Rev.  Dr.  Francis  G.  Peabody  says  : 

"This    superb  Handbook  of  New    York.     I   am 
amazed  at  the  completeness  and  elaborateness  of  its 
work." 
Artemas  IVard  say  : 

*'  The  greatest  Handbook  of  modern  history." 
Librarian  Saunders,  of  Astor  Library, says  ; 

"A  very  attractive  and  valuable  work,  for  which 
you  deserve  a  gold  medal." 
Rev.  Dr.  George  JV.  Shinn  says  : 

"  What  a  nohle  book  you  have  made  !    It  seems  to 
me  to  be  finer  than  anything  I  have  seen  in  the  way 
of  such  publications." 
Col.  Thos.  Wentworth  Higginson  says  : 

"  It  surely  should  be  appreciated  by  New  Yorkers, 
as  it  is  their  best  bid,  up  to  this  time,  for  the  character 
of  a  metropolis." 
Hon .  John  E.  Russell  says  : 

' 'It  will  be  a  monument  to  your  skill  and  industry 
which  will  remain  when  the  city  has  been  again 
transformed  by  the  inevitable  growth  of  the  country.1' 
Rev.  Dr.  A.  H.  Surlingham  says  : 

"  They  are  immeasurably  ahead,  in  way  of  accurate 
information,  ample  and  beautiful  illustration,  and  in 
fine  execution,  of  any  guide  books  I  have  ever  seen.'' 

Rev.  Dr.  Andrew  P.  Peabody  the  venerable  preacher 
to  the  University,  just  before  his  decease,  wrote  : 
"  I  have  the  greatest  admiration  for  your  ability, 
skill  and  enterprise.    No  man  deserves  success  more 
fully  than  you,  and  if  my  best  wishes  could  put  a 
sreath  of  wind  into  your  sails,  they  would  feel  the

MUTUAL  LIFE  INSURANCE  COMPANY 


OK 


YORK. 


RICHARD  A.  McCURDY,    -  -     PRESIDENT 

Assets  Nearly  $200,000,000 


AN  ATTRACTIVE   INVESTMENT 


The  policies  of  THE  MUTUAL  LIFE 
INSURANCE  COMPANY  of  New  York  are 
regarded  by  prudent  and  far-sighted 
men  of  affairs  as  offering  the  best 
form  of  absolutely  secure  investment 
not  subject  to  the  changes  and  vicissi- 
tudes of  trade  and  commerce,  or  to 
fluctuations  of  market  values  which 
necessarily  pertain  to  stocks  and 
bonds.  When  the  investor  shall  have 
reached  old  age,  or  in  the  event  of  his 
prior  death,  the  sale  of  his  property 
is  not  required  in  order  to  realize  its 
value,  for  the  reason  that  the  contract 
itself  immediately  produces  its  value 
in  cash  at  the  time  it  is  most  needed 
to  benefit  those  for  whom  it  was  ob- 
tained. 

If  a  man  undertakes  the  purchase 
of  property — be  it  houses  and  lands 
or  personal  estate — with  the  intention 
of  gradually  completing  the  purchase 
out  of  his  future  annual  income,  in  the 
event  of  his  death  before  his  intentions 
have  been  carried  out,  he  leaves,  as 
the  result  of  his  efforts,  a  collection  of 
incompleted  assets  burdened  with 
debts  and  obligations,  which  if  liqui- 
dated by  a  forced  sale,  frequently  ne- 
cessitates a  sacrifice  of  a  large  portion 
of  the  interests  of  the  survivors. 

To  an  investment  policy  in  the 
Mutual  Life,  and  to  No  other  form  of 
recognized  investment  belongs  this 


provision  :  the  unpaid  installments — 
which  correspond  to  the  incompleted 
purchases  just  referred  to — are  at 
once  extinguished,  and  the  contract  is 

good  for  its  entire  face 
value  without  deduction. 

It  becomes  at  once  an  unimpaired 
estate  with  a  fixed  future  income  for 
the  family,  without  the  risks  and  ex- 
penses of  a  settlement  sale.  To  this 
form  of  contract,  which  combines  all 
the  best  features  of  modern  Life  In- 
surance, with  the  additional  advan- 
tages of  creating  in  the  future  an 
interest-bearing  capital  as  an  estate 
for  the  maintenance  of  the  family, 
The  Mutual  Life  invites  the  attention 
of  those  who  are  seeking  safe  and 
profitable  investments.  It  invites  in- 
vestment not  merely  by  those  having 
surplus  funds,  but  by  all  who  desire 
for  themselves  and  their  families  per- 
fect and  absolute  protection  against 
the  consequences  of  death  or  unex- 
pected financial  reverses. 

The  interest-bearing  Consols  of  The 
Mutual  Life  Insurance  Company  of 
New  York  are  issued  in  a  variety  of 
forms  to  suit  individual  preferences 
and  circumstances.  The  rates  of  an- 
nual purchase  deposit  are  so  adjusted 
as  to  compensate  for  a  greater  or  less 
amount  of  future  annual  income  as 
may  be  desired  by  the  purchaser.

A  Quaint  and  Valuable  Book. 


WHERE  TO  STOP:   A  GUIDE  TO  THE    BEST    HOTELS.1 


Moses  King,  of  Boston,  has  just  added  to  his  famous  series  of  "  King's 
Handbooks  "  a  charming  booklet  entitled  "  Where  to  Stop  :  A  Guide  to  the  Best 
Hotels  in  the  World."  It  is  the  most  serviceable  guide  to  the  representative 
hotels  of  all  the  continents  that  has  ever  been  published,  for  while  others  have 
published  great  hotel  directories,  or  indiscriminately  grouped  hotels  that  pay 
for  their  notices,  Mr.  King's  selection  of  the  best  hotels  has  been  made 
regardless  of  payment.  It  has  that  practical  and  handsome  makeup,  combined 
with  accuracy  and  trustworthiness,  so  usual  to  Mr.  King's  publications.  It  is 
practically  a  handbook  of  famous  hotels ;  and  as  such  has  a  peculiar  interest 
and  value  for  all  who  travel  by  land  or  water.  The  first  part  of  the  book 
contains  announcements  and  descriptions  of  400  great  hotels,  each  illustrated 
with  a  delicate  half-tone  picture.  These  cuts  show  nearly  400  of  the  foremost 
hostelries  of  the  world,  like  the  Fifth  Avenue  and  Waldorf  of  New  York;  the 
Brunswick  and  Vendome  of  Boston;  the  Hygeia,  the  Ponce  de  Leon;  the 
Auditorium,  the  Coronado,  the  Four  Seasons,  the  Raymond,  and  the  splendid 
houses  at  Las  Vegas,  Colorado  Springs,  Helena,  Lookout  Mountain,  Long 
Branch,  Luray,  Monterey,  the  White  Mountains,  etc.,  etc. 

Here  also  are  the  very  interesting  pictures  of  the  chief  hotels  of  Cuba  and 
Jamaica,  of  Mexico  and  South  America,  of  the  Bermudas  and  the  Azores  ;  and 
a  great  number  of  British  and  French,  German  and  Scandinavian,  Italian  and 
Swiss  taverns,  with  several  in  North  Africa,  Syria,  India  and  Japan. 

The  second  part  of  "Where  to  Stop"  consists  of  a  wonderful  list  of  3000 
notable  hotels  of  the  world,  made  up  from  the  very  latest  authorities,  and  with 
the  rates  of  board  shown  forth.  This  list  includes  every  important  city  in  the 
world,  and  the  populations  of  these  cities  are  given,  as  obtained  from  the 
recent  censuses,  American,  British,  German,  etc.  There  are  also  a  few  words 
of  comment  in  connection  with  each,  giving  the  chief  characteristics  of  the 
place.  This  singularly  interesting  list  includes  the  hotels  in  India  and  Persia, 
Japan  and  China,  South  Africa  and  Egypt,  besides  the  chief  houses  in  Europe 
and  America.  The  contemplation  of  their  titles  alone  is  full  of  varied  sug- 
gestiveness  and  fascination;  and  the  information  conveyed  is  of  practical 
value. 

"  Where  to  Stop"  is  prettily  bound  in  heavy  pebbled,  muslin-lined  paper, 
with  illuminated  designs  of  travel-scenes.  It  will  be  sent,  postpaid,  on  receipt 
of  25  cents,  by  Moses  King,  Boston.

C^AVE    two   colonial    churches,   MILHAU'S  PHARMACY   ALONE  REMAINS   PER- 
MANENT of  thousands  of  concerns  on  Broadway  since  1830. 

JOHN  MILHAU,  the  founder  of  this  house,  was  born  in  Baltimore,  1796,  of  French  refu- 
gees, descended  from  very  old  families,  who  fled  from  the  servile  insurrection  in  St. 
Domingo  at  the  time  of  the  great  French  revolution,  being  robbed  on  the  passage  of  their 
jewelry  and  valuables  by  corsairs  who  overhauled  the  vessel.  On  the  death  of  his  father, 
in  1813,  he  left  college  and  launched  into  the  drug  business.  He  was  too  American  to  settle 
in  France  where  his  widowed  mother  went  with  her  children  on  the  restoration  of  Louis  the 
Eighteenth,  or  to  accept  the  unsolicited  appointment  of  French  Consul-General  at  Baltimore. 
He  returned  from  his  first  trip,  made  for  business  and  study,  on  the  "  Cadmus  "  with  General 
Lafayette,  a  distant  relative,  who  was  making  his  memorable  visit  to  the  United  States. 

In  1830,  on  his  third  trip  to  Paris,  stopping  at  the  mansion  of  his  brother-in-law,  the  dis- 
tinguished Dr.  Sue,  the  physician  of  the  Empress  Josephine  and  the  father  of  Eugene  Sue 
the  novelist,  he  witnessed  the  uprising  of  the  populace  and  the  expulsion  of  Charles  the 
Tenth.  He  at  once  determined  to  come  back  to  his  native  land,  though  General  Lafayette, 
who  had  been  called  to  the  head  of  affairs,  entreated  him  to  remain.  Entrusted  by  the 
General  with  the  government  despatches,  and  with  a  safe  conduct,  he  started  for  the  United 
States  via  London.  There  he  completed  his  purchases  for  this  shop,  which  he  fitted  up  on 
an  unprecedented  scale  of  magnificence,  the  first  to  have  marble  tiling.  The  infusion  pans, 
counter  scales  and  prescription  balances  were  of  solid  silver.  He  had  a  bust  made  of  Dr. 
Rush,  of  Philadelphia,  the  foremost  American  scientist  of  the  day,  to  surmount  the  doorway. 
All  else  was  in  keeping.  The  New  York  College  of  Pharmacy,  to  which  he  was  admitted, 
gave  its  first  course  that  very  year.  He  filled  a  prominent  part,  as  the  records  show,  in  its 
determined,  well-fought  contest,  when,  with  a  backing  of  pharmaceutical  and  medical  bodies, 
it  procured  the  beneficent  law  of  1848  that  prohibits  the  importation  of  adulterated,  deterio- 
rated, inferior  or  spurious  drugs  into  the  United  States.  He  headed  the  suit  in  1854  by  which 
Sharp's  Broadway  railroad,  whose  franchise,  a  fraud  on  the  city,  obtained  through  ques- 
tionable legislation,  was  perpetually  enjoined.  This  injunction  was  shamelessly  circum- 
vented in  1886  through  the  boodle  Board  of  Alderman.  His  eldest  son,  the  late  John  J. 
Milhau,  attained  distinction  as  Surgeon  and  Brevet-Brigadier  General  of  the  United 
States  Army.  His  only  surviving  son  and  partner,  Edward  L.  Milhau,  is  his  successor.

Ninety-nine  times  out  of  a  hundred  a  person 
buying  a  high  class  evening  newspaper  will  ask 
for  the  MAIL  AND  EXPRESS.  It  prints 
the  cream  of  the  news  daily,  and  all  matter  is 
carefully  sifted  by  a  corps  of  experienced  news- 
paper men  before  it  appears  in  its  columns. 

The  MAIL  AND  EXPRESS  has  a  healthy, 
growing  circulation,  and  the  leading  evening 
newspaper  is  a  welcome  guest  in  the  homes  of 
New  York's  best  citizens.  It  prints  daily  more 
interesting  special  features  and  catchy  little 
departments  than  any  newspaper  in  the  metrop- 
olis, morning  or  evening. 

The  advertising  patronage  of  the  MAIL 
AND  EXPRESS  is  the  most  select.  All  the 
leading  merchants  of  Greater  New  York  use  its 
columns  to  make  their  wares  known. 

It  is  the  great  home  newspaper.

Over  a  successful  business  career  of  nearly  forty

changes  made  both  in  this  vicinity  and  through- 
out the  city.  We  have  kept  pace  with  them, 
and  ofttimes  in  advance,  particularly  in  the 
manufacture  of  fine  apparel,  both  made-to- 
measure  and  ready-to-wear. 

Our     products     equal    the    best,    while     our

Designers,  Photo- 
Engravers  &amp;  Electrotypers 


21  &amp;  23  BARCLAY  ST.,  26  &amp;  28  PARK  PLACE,  NEW  YORK. 

F.  A.  RINGLER,  President.  M.  R.  BRINKMAN,  Vice-President  and  Treasurer 

G.  J.  KRAEMER,  Secretary.  JUSTIN  RINGLER,  Manager. 


We  manufacture  plates  for  all  printing  and  embossing  purposes,  from  the 
finest  photo-gravure  down  to  the  outline  newspaper  cut.  Our  prices  are 
low,  compared  with  the  quality  of  work.  Our  processes  are  as  follows : 

HALF-TONE  PATENT  PROCESS. 

The  chief  points  of  this  process  differ  from  all  others,  and  are  as  follows  : 
A  negative  of  the  painting,  engraving,  photograph  or  work  to  be  reproduced  is 
first  obtained.  As  in  any  other  branch  of  Photo-Engraving  a  picture  in  reliet 
is  then  made  by  our  new  method  011  copper.  The  copper  plate,  being  finished, 
is  then  covered  with  an  infinitesimal  coating  of  steel,  by  means  of  an  electric 
current,  so  as  to  enable  it  to  withstand  the  wear  of  printing,  and  keep  up  the 
sharpness  of  the  printing  surface  to  an  unlimited  edition  (patent  applied  for), 
as  we  are  the  only  process  engravers  in  the  country  that  have  applied  the  above 
method  successfully. 

ZINC    ETCHING. 

We  were  the  first  establishment  in  this  country  that  produced  Zinc  Etching 
Engravings  for  newspapers  and  commercial  printing  successfully,  and  by  our 
electric  light  facilities  we  are  in  a  position  to  turn  out  the  work  on  time,  as  we 
do  not  have  to  depend  on  sunlight.  When  necessary  it  is  possible  for  us  to 
produce  a  cut  from  a  pen  and  ink  drawing  inside  of  two  (2)  hours.  The  superi- 
ority as  to  a  clean,  sharp  and  deep  line  of  these  plates  is  generally  acknowledged 
by  the  press.  All  cuts  for  newspaper  printing,  where  stereotype  plates  are 
used,  we  suggest  to  have  mounted  on  a  metal  back. 

PHOTO-ELECTROTYPING. 

This  process  is  best  adapted  for  the  reproduction  of  book  pages  in  all  languages, 
also  for  reproducing  large  catalogues  to  a  small  pocket  edition  size.  We  are 
prepared  to  execute  large  orders  at  the  rate  of  several  hundred  pages  per  day. 
The  advantage  of  this  process  for  this  particular  kind  of  work  is  not  only  that  it 
is  cheaper,  but  also  that  we  furnish  a  sharp  and  deep  electro-plate  ready  to  be 
used  the  same  as  any  other  electrotype  plate  taken  from  a  type  form  (FOR 
PATENT  BLOCKS),  or  mounted  on  wood  blocks  ready  for  the  printer's  use. 

ELECTROTYPING. 

We  assert,  with  a  degree  of  pride,  that  our  facilities  for  the  rapid  and  satisfactory 
execution  of  Electrotyping  cannot  be  equaled  to-day  by  any  other  house.  We 
have  the  largest  baths,  the  best  moulding  facilities,  and  the  only  perfect  metal- 
izing  process  (our  own  invention),  and  the  latest  machines  and  appliances  to  be 
found  in  the  country  for  finishing  plates.  We  are  prepared  to  execute  orders 
of  any  size  or  quantity  with  a  speed,  accuracy  and  finish  such  as  no  other  house 
can  hope  to  rival,  and  at  low  prices. 

STEEL-FACING  PROCESS. 

All  half-tone  plates  etched  on  copper  for  art  reproductions,  book  and  catalogue 


illustrations,  or  duplicate  electrotypes  made  from  wood  cuts  and  other  engraved 
plates,  are  well  known  to  run  longer  on  steel-faced  plates  than  on  the  ordinary 
electrotype.  Jobs  to  be  printed  in  red  ink  (a  color  that  is  injured  in  brilliancy 
by  contact  with  copper),  should  also  be  steel-faced,  this  additional  expense 


„  pi 

ited  in  red  ink  (a  color  that  is  injured  in  brilliancy 
tiould  also  be  steel-faced,  this  additional  expense 

being  only  a  fraction  more  than  the  price  of  ordinary  plates.  We  recommend 
the  facing  of  plates  in  the  above  cases  as  giving  much  more  satisfactior 
Samples  of  our  work  and  estimates  cheerfully  furnished  on  application.

TOPHER G.  TIEDEMAN,  author  of  "  Real  Property,"  "  Legislation  of  Police  Power," 
etc.,  and  Professor  of  Law  in  the  University  of  the  City  of  New  York.      The  present 
volume,  like  the  other  works  of  the  author,  is  designed  to  present,  within  the  confines  of  one 
volume,  a  succinct  and  clear  statement  of  the  law  of  Municipal  Corporations,  by  an  inclusion 
of  everything  material,  and  exclusion  of  everything  immaterial,  to  the  clear  comprehension 
of  the  general  principles  and  rules  of  law  bearing  upon  or  involved  in  the  subject. 


The  Art  of  Winning  Cases ;  or  Modern  Advocacy. 

By  HENRY  HARDWICKE,  of  the  New  York  Bar. 

IN  this  work  the  author  has  given  many  valuable  suggestions  upon  preparation  for  trial 
and  the  conduct  of  cases  in  court.      He  has  net  confined  himself  to  a  bare  statement  of 
the  rules  which  should  guide  the  advocate  in  the  trial  of  cases,  but  he  has  shown  how 
Erskine,  Scarlett,  Daniel  Webster,  Rufus  Choate,  Henry  Clay  and  many  other  great  English 
and  American  advocates  have  put  these  rules  into  practice. 

THE    PROPER   STUDY    OF   AN   ADVOCATE    IS   ADVOCACY. 

It  is  unquestionably  true  that  advocacy  is  a  subject  which  has  been  too  much  neglected 
of  late.  No  matter  how  profound  a  lawyer's  knowledge  of  the  law  may  be,  if  he  is  not 
skilled  in  the  art  of  presenting  his  arguments  upon  the  law  and  the  facts  to  court  and  jury, 
as  well  as  in  the  difficult  art  of  examining  witnesses,  he  can  never  do  his  client  justice. 
Many  mortifying  failures  are  daily  made  in  our  courts,  simply  because  the  lawyers  who  have 
failed  are  ignorant  of  the  methods  of  preparing  and  trying  cases,  followed  by  the  greatest 
and  most  successful  advocates.  These  methods  are  clearly  stated  in  this  work.

and  see  whether  our  claim  that  we  are  doing  by  far  the  BEST  HALF-TONE

that  OUR  PLATES  ARE  THE  BEST,  and  we  are  now  doing  very  much 
more  Magazine  work  than  all  the  other  engravers  of  New  York  combined.

Fabric  Fire  Hose  Co. 

The  Fabric  Kire  Hose  Co.,  13  Park  Row,  are  the  inventors  and  sole  manu- 
facturers of  a  patented  fire  hose,  known  as  the  balanced-woven  fabric,  rubber-lined  fire 
hose,  adapted  for  fire  protection  in  cities  and  for  general  mill  use.  They  are  also  the  originators 
of  a  process  of  rendering  the  fabric  rot  and  mildew-proof  by  waxing  the  yarn,  a  very  valu- 
able feature  in  a  fire  hose.  The  hose  of  this  Company  is  found  in  nearly  all  of  the  fire  de- 
partments of  the  large  cities,  the  sales  up  to  the  present  time  amounting  to  nearly  5,500,000 
feet.  This  company  supplied  the  World's  Fair  with  80,000  feet  of  fire  hose,  the  contract 
having  been  awarded  in  competition  with  the  entire  world. 

Mechanical  Rubber  Co. 

The  Mechanical  Rubber  Co.,  with  offices  at  15  Park  Row,  is  the  largest 
concern  in  the  country  in  the  mechanical  rubber  line.  Its  annual  productions  mount  up  into 
the  millions,  and  embrace  a  very  wide  range  of  articles,  such  as  belting,  hose,  packing  gas- 
kets, mats,  bicycle  tires,  tubing,  valves,  wringer  rolls,  etc.  Factories  located  both  East  and  West 
are  thoroughly  equipped  with  the  most  improved  machinery  and  with  every  other  facility  for 
the  economical  production  and  distribution  of  goods.  The  hose,  belting  and  packing  of  its 
manufacture,  are  made  in  two  grades — "Amazon,"  the  very  best  that  the  finest  materials  and 
workmanship  can  produce,  and  "Brazilian,"  a  high  grade  brand,  equal  to  the  best  produc- 
tions of  most  other  makers.  A  strong  recommendation  in  favor  of  these  goods  is  the 
uniformity  of  excellence,  a  merit  often  lacking  in  the  products  of  other  makers.  No  pains  or 
expense  are  spared  to  keep  up  the  highest  standard  of  quality,  a  task  less  difficult  for  a  com- 
pany so  magnificently  equipped  than  for  others.

THE  NEW  YORK  "PRESS." 

In  the  four  past  issues  of  PRINTERS' 
INK  a  statement  has  been  conspicu- 
ously published  to  the  effect  that  the 
American  Newspaper  Directory  for 
1894  accords  to  the  New  York  Press  a 
larger  circulation  rating  than  any  other 
daily  paper  in  New  York  City  receives. 
Now  the  New  York  Tress  does  not 
claim  to  have  the  largest  circulation  of 
any  daily  paper  in  New  York.  That 
claim  is  put  forth  by  the  Sun,  the  Sftyws, 
the  Herald  and  the'  World.  The  inter- 
esting fact  is  that  the  'Press  is  the  only 
one  of  the  five  that  is  willing  to  allow 
the  public  to  know  just  what  edition  it 
actually  has  printed.  By  the  Directory 
system  of  rating  circulations,  the  letter 
"  A  "  is  the  highest  symbol  accorded  to 
any  publication  that  declines  or  neglects 
to  furnish  information  on  the  subject. 
It  means  exceeding  75,000  copies.  All 
the  four  papers  named  above  are  rated 
"A,"  but  the  "Press  stands  alone  as  the 
one  willing  to  show  the  absolute  facts  ;  it 
therefore  gets  credit  for  its  actual  aver- 
age issue  of  111,812  copies  per  day 
throughout  an  entire  year,  and  it  ought 
to  be  mighty  proud  of  the  success  it 
has  achieved. -Printers'  Ink,  MAY  2,1894.

the  Post-office  and  the  great  newspaper  offices,  together 
with  its  sunny  offices  and  its  exposure  to  the  cool,  south- 
westerly breezes  of  summer,  make  it  a  most  desirable 
office  building.  The  offices  are  subdivided  to  suit 
tenants,  without  charge.  For  particulars  apply  to  .  .

THE    AMERICAN  TRACT  SOCIETY, 

GENERAL  DEPOSITORY,  10  EAST  23d  ST.    NEW  BUILDING,  NASSAU  &amp;  BEEKMAN  STS. 


1.  ITS  OBJECTS.     The  Society  was  organized  seventy  years  ago,  in  1825. 
Such  men   as   Bishop   Griswold,   Drs.   Spring,   Milledoler,    Milnor,   Baldwin, 
Edwards,  and  other  eminent  divines  and  laymen  of  many  evangelical  denom- 
inations,  saw  the  need  of   harmony   in   preparing   and    circulating  a  gospel 
literature  for  the  use  of  all  Christians,  and  by  the  coalescing  of  various  local 
societies  this  National  Institution  was  formed. 

Its  work  has  been  conducted  by  three  committees,  the  Publishing,  Dis- 
tributing and  Finance,  with  their  several  secretaries,  supervised  by  the  three 
united  in  its  Executive  Committee. 

Its  work  is  on  three  main  lines :  sales  of  its  publications  by  its  store,  in 
various  depositories  and  through  the  trade;  sales  and  grants  by  its  colporters; 
and  grants  to  the  destitute  and  to  Christian  workers  at  home,  and  aid  to 
missionaries  in  many  foreign  lands. 

Its  colportage,  carrying  the  gospel  in  the  most  effective  publications  to 
destitute  regions,  largely  at  the  west  and  south,  is  a  work  whose  necessity  and 
usefulness  cannot  well  be  overestimated.  The  colporter  is  a  lay  preacher  as 
well  as  a  salesman,  and  hundreds  of  Sunday-schools  and  churches  have  been 
started  by  them. 

The  foreign  missions  of  many  denominations  most  gratefully  welcome  the 
invaluable  aid  of  the  Society  in  publishing  books  and  tracts  in  151  languages. 

2.  THE  PUBLICATIONS  of  the  Society,    consisting    of   books,  tracts,  wall- 
rolls,  cards,  and   periodicals,  aggregate  many  millions  of  copies.     They  are 
adapted  to  the  use  of  all  ages  and  all  classes  of  people,  and  in  many  languages. 
They   are  of   a  high    standard  of   excellence    in   literary   merit,    engravings, 
material  and  workmanship,  and  are  sold  at  reasonable  rates. 

Some  of  its  issues  have  attained  a  remarkably  large  circulation:  its  Bible 
Dictionary,  220,000  copies;  Pilgrim's  Progress,  453,000;  Baxter's  Call,  460,000; 
Nelson  on  Infidelity,  140,000;  Songs  for  Little  Ones  at  Home,  338,000;  Peep 
of  Day,  155,000;  Dew  Drops,  765,000;  Daily  Food,  511,000;  Come  to  Jesus, 
746,000.  Many  of  its  tracts  have  reached  a  circulation  of  over  a  million  copies 
each.  Its  periodicals  are  seven — four  in  English,  two  in  German,  three  for 
children;  two  weekly, five  monthly,  and  are  as  follows:  American  Messenger, Child's 
Paper,  Morning  Light,  Apples  of  Gold,  Light  and  Life,  Deiitscher  Volks-freund, 
and  Amerikanischer  Botschafter,  In  addition  to  its  circulation  by  colportage 
and  grants,  and  from  its  general  depository  at  10  East  23d  Street,  it  main- 
tains agencies  or  branches  in  Boston,  Philadelphia,  Rochester,  Chicago, 
Cincinnati  and  San  Francisco. 

3.  THE  NEW  BUILDING  is  upon  the  site  occupied  by  the  Society  since  its 
organization.     The  lot  is  nearly  100  feet  square.     The  structure  rises  twenty 
stories  from  Nassau  Street,  with  a  basement  and  cellar  below,  and   a  tower 
three  stories  above  the  main  roof,  covering  about  half  the  area.     The  height  to 
the  top  of  the  tower  is  291  feet,  to  top  of  the  staff  rising  from  the  tower,  307 
feet.     The   depth  of  the  excavation  below  the  pavement  is  thirty-five   feet, 
from  which  piles  were  driven  below  from  ten  to  twenty-five  feet. 

The  frame  is  of  steel  skeleton,  lined  with  brick;  the  front  wall  for  the  first 
six  stories  is  of  granite,  above  which  it  will  be  brick  and  terra-cotta. 

The  money  needed  for  erecting  the  building  has  been  obtained  by  mort- 
gaging the  lot,  so  that  the  current  operations  of  the  Society  will  not^be  inter- 
rupted by  this  undertaking.  There  is  good  reason  to  hope  that  the  gift  of  this 
ground  to  the  Society  by  its  founders  will  become  the  means  of  furnishing  an 
endowment,  which  will  supplement  the  gifts  of  its  members  and  friends  and  be  a 
pledge  for  the  execution  of  any  trusts  committed  to  it  by  legacy  or  otherwise.

CHAS.  A.  SCHIEREN  &amp;  Co. 

LEATHER    BELTING 
AND  LACE  LEATHER  MANUFACTURERS. 


CHARLES  A.  SCHIEREN  &amp;  CO.,  of  Ferry  and  Cliff  Streets, 
New  York,  are  pre-eminent  as  manufacturers  of  leather  belting  and 
lace  leather.  Their  factory  is  considered  a  model  establishment  in 
its  line,  because  of  its  improved  machinery  and  economic  appliances. 
The  firm  owns  a  number  of  patents,  granted  on  inventions  by  Mr. 
Schieren,  and  under  them  manufactures  such  specialties  as  Electric 
and  Perforated  Belting  for  use  on  dynamos  and  swift-running  electric 
light  machinery  ;  leather  Link  Belting,  for  use  in  mines  and  on 
machinery  exposed  to  water  ;  and  Planer  Belting,  suitable  for  wood- 
working machinery.  The  leather  for  Planer  Belting  is  tanned  with  a 
view  to  flexibility  and  durability.  In  order  to  supply  its  factory  with 
materials  the  firm  operates  its  extensive  oak  leather  tanneries  at 
at  Bristol,  Tenn.,  which  are  in  the  heart  of  the  oak  bark  region. 
The  capacity  of  these  tanneries  is  60,000  hides  per  annum.  It  also 
operates  the  tannery  at  Adamsburg,  Pa. ,  and  Lace  Leather  tannery 
in  Brooklyn. 

Charles  A.  Schieren,  the  founder  of  the  firm,  was  born  in 
Rhenish  Prussia,  in  1842,  and  with  his  parents  emigrated  to  this 
country  in  1856.  He  had  received  a  public  school  education  in 
Germany.  In  his  youth  he  assisted  his  father  in  conducting  a  cigar  and 
tobacco  business  in  Brooklyn.  In  1864,  as  clerk  he  entered  the  ser- 
vice of  Philip  F.  Pasquay,  leather  belting  manufacturer  of  New  York. 
By  virtue  of  energy  and  close  application  he  soon  mastered  the  details 
of  the  business,  and  he  became  the  manager  of  the  establishment,  on 
the  death  of  his  employer,  in  1866.  Two  years  later,  with  limited 
means,  he  set  up  his  own  establishment.  In  1887  Mr.  Schieren  admit- 
ted as  partner  F.  A.  M.  Burrell,  who  had  been  in  his  service  as  clerk 
for  ten  years.  The  firm  has  branch  houses  in  Chicago,  Boston  and 
Philadelphia,  and  the  products  of  its  factory  are  shipped  to  all  parts  of 
the  civilized  world.  Mr.  Schieren  was  elected  Mayor  of  Brooklyn  by 
33,000  majority  in  Nov.  '93  for  two  years.  He  was  one  of  the  founders 
of  the  Hide  and  Leather  National  Bank,  and  is  now  its  Vice-President. 

The  Leather  Belting  made  by  this  house  comprises  every  length 
and  width,  and  also  of  heavy  and  light  weights,  as  their  users  may 
require.  Whatever  is  not  carried  in  general  stock  can  readily  be 
produced  by  the  house  of  Charles  A.  Schieren  &amp;  Co.

THE    LAWS    OF    MASSACHUSETTS    PROVIDE    THAT 
EACH  POLICY  ISSUED   BY  THE

OF  PITTSFIELD,  MASS., 


Shall  have  a  DEFINITE  SURREN- 
DER VALUE  IN  CASH,  or  paid-up 
insurance  available  at  the  end  of  every 
year,  after  two  annual  premiums  have 
been  paid. 

The  policy-holders  of  the  BERK- 
SHIRE are,  thus,  absolutely  secured 
against  any  loss. 

Every  policy  issued  by  the  BERK-

ment, with  its  cash  values  available  at 
the  time  of  need.

Why  should  we

Because  •i 

Its  service  is  prompt  and  reliable. 

It  has  new  lines  and  modern  equip-

It  reaches  every  important  commer- 
cial point  in  the  United  States  and  Canada 
and  connects  with  the  i,i&lt;:  A m  xc ;  Atlantic

It  maintains  genuine  and  aggressive 
competition. 

The  present  low  rates  and  good  ser- 
vice have  been  obtained  only  through 
its  competition. 

Public  patronage  is  essential  to  the 
continued  maintenance  of  competition. 

Its  employees  are  intelligent,  diligent,

NO.  280   BROADWAY,  STEWART   BUILDING,  BROADWAY,  EAST  SIDE,  FROM   READE   TO  CHAMBERS   STREET, 


BRADSTREET'S 

A  name  esteemed  throughout  the  commercial  and  financial  world. 

[A  Sketch  reprinted  from  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK."] 

The  Bradstreet  Company  has  achieved  a  wonderful  work  in  relation  to 
mercantile  credit.  Society  studies  into  peoples'  genealogies  and  characters  ; 
the  Church  examines  their  creeds  and  practices  ;  and  the  mercantile  world 
keenly  scrutinizes  their  methods  and  responsibility.  If  these  last  named  are 
worthy  to  establish  credit,  they  must  be  reported  by  human  action  and  personal 
judgment.  The  Bradstreet  Company  is  practically  a  clearing  house  for  all 
classes  of  information  concerning  mercantile  affairs  and  mercantile  credit, 
originated  by  and  intended  for  business  men  throughout  the  world.  Its  infor- 
mation is  obtained  from  a  vast  number  of  sources,  competent,  trustworthy,  and 
ramifying  everywhere,  and  in  such  close  and  confidential  touch  with  The 
Bradstreet  Company  that  the  result  is  an  immense  array  of  digested  facts  as  to 
business  men,  containing  the  detailed  histories  of  more  than  3,000,000  firms 
and  individuals  in  active  trade,  at  home  and  abroad.  The  object  of  search  is 
the  absolute  truth  as  to  each  mercantile  credit,  and  this  is  attained  by  a 
consensus  of  many  impartial  reports  from  honorable  local  observers,  who  also 
note  each  passing  change,  and  the  advance  or  falling  back  of  the  firm  or  the 
individual.  With  these  facts  in  view,  business  may  be  done  with  intelligence, 
and  thereby  with  the  reasonable  assurance  of  success,  and  encouragement  for 
the  enlargement  of  enterprise  and  the  development  of  trade. 

The  massive  quarto  volumes  of  more  than  2300  pages,  which  it  publishes 
four  times  in  every  year,  contain  the  estimated  worth  and  recognized  credit, 
business  and  address  of  more  than  a  million  of  subjects,  besides  much  other 
valuable  information.  Bradstreet's  offices  nearly  compass  the  earth.  That  its 
mighty  mission  has  been  fulfilled  with  fidelity  as  to  facts,  conservatism  as  to 
judgment,  and  conscientiousness  as  to  details,  is  proven  by  a  record  which 
challenges  the  attention  and  commands  the  respect  of  every  person  who  has 
sought  information  through  its  channels  or  availed  himself  of  its  facilities  for 
the  investigation  of  personal  credits.  The  Bradstreet  Company  is  the  oldest, 
and  financially  the  strongest,  organization  of  its  kind  working  in  the  one 
interest  and  under  one  management.  It  has  wider  ramifications,  with  greater 
investment  of  capital,  and  expending  more  money  every  year  for  the  collection 
and  dissemination  of  information  than  any  similar  institution  in  the  world. 
It  has  long  been  recognized  and  practically  endorsed  by  the  various  de- 
partments of  the  government,  as  also  by  the  highest  local  courts  of  the 
United  States. 

This  company  publishes,  under  the  name  of  TSradstrcct's,  a  sixteen-page 
weekly  newspaper,  which  covers  the  condition  of  the  crops  and  markets  ;  and, 
dealing  as  it  does,  with  the  news  of  commerce,  finance  and  manufactures, 
TBradstreet's  occupies  a  unique  place.  It  is  impartial  and  unbiased,  and  is 
quoted  the  world  over  as  an  authority.  An  active  department  of  this  com- 
pany's business  is  the  Bradstreet's  bindery,  which  ranks  with  the  most  famous 
binderies  of  Paris  and  London. 

The  Bradstreet  Company  has  been  an  important  factor  in  the  develop- 
ment of  the  world's  commerce  for  more  than  forty  years,  but  its  pre-eminence 
began  in  1876,  under  the  presidency  of  Charles  F.  Clark.  The  executive  and 
New-York  offices  are  at  279,  281  and  283  Broadway.

The  total  cost  for  the  past  13  years  for 
$10,000  insurance  in  the  MUTUAL  RESERVE 
amounts  to  less  than  Old  System  Companies 
charge  for  $4,500  at  ordinary  life  rates — 
the  saving  in  premiums  being  equal  to  a 
cash  dividend  of  nearly  60  PER  CENT. 


THE  MUTUAL  RESERVE,  by  reducing  the 
rates  to  harmonize  with  the  amount  required 
for  Death  Claims,  and  by  judicious  economy 
in  expenses  of  management,  has  already 
saved  its  policy  holders  over  thirty-five

Tefft,  Weller  &amp;  Co. 

Wholesale    Dry    Goods    Merchants. 


[Reprinted  from  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY."] 

A  ¥  AEFFT,  WELDER  &amp;  CO. .importers  and  jobbers  of  dry  goods,  of  326,  328  and  330 

Broadway,  is  one  of  the  oldest  and  most  widely  esteemed  houses  in  the  wholesale 

-*-        dry-goods  trade.      Its  members  have  been  prominently  identified  with  public 

interests  for  the  past  forty  years.    This  business  was  founded  January  i,  1849,  by 

Erastus  T.  TefFt ;  and  the  firm  name  has  been  successively,  E.  T.  Tefft  &amp;  Co  ;  Teffts,  Gris- 

wold  &amp;  Kellogg;  TefFt,  Griswold  &amp;  Co.;  and  Tefft,  Weller  &amp;  Co.      Through  all  these 

changes  the  house  has  been  steadily  advancing,  enlarging  its  trade  in  all  directions,  and 

increasing  its  capital,  facilities  and  force,  as  well  as  its  experience.     Its  founder  was  a  rare 

man.    He  was  a  man  of  quick  perceptions  and  sound  judgment.     He  was  eminently  just 

in  all  his  ways.     He  was  of  a  conservative  disposition,  yet  was  bold,  courageous  and  daring 

when  the  occasion  demanded  these  qualities.      He  was  uniformly  courteous,  kind  and 

gentle,  and  commanded  the  confidence  and  respect  of  all  who  knew  him.     Mr.  Tefft  died 

November  10,  1888,  at  the  venerable  age  of  78  years. 

The  present  firm  is  composed  of  his  two  sons,  William  E.  Tefft  and  Frank  Griswold 
Tefft,  George  C.  Clarke,  John  N.  Beach  and  Morton  D.  Bogue.  The  firm  name  of  Tefft, 
Weller  &amp;  Co.  is  retained  as  a  trade-mark  ;  there  having  been  no  Weller  interests  in  the 
house  since  the  death  of  Joseph  H.  Weller  in  1886,  two  years  previous  to  the  death  of  E.  T. 
Tefft.  The  firm  occupies  the  entire  seven  floors  of  the  spacious  iron  and  granite-front 
building  at  326,  328  and  330  Broadway,  and  three  floors  of  No.  324,  together  with  two  floors 
of  Nos.  320  and  322,  making  in  the  aggregate  166,250  square  feet  of  floor  space.  These  vast 
areas  are  occupied  by  very  full  lines  of  the  goods  in  which  the  house  deals,  admirably 
arranged  and  ordered.  The  location  of  Tefft,  Weller  &amp;  Co.'s  buildings,  on  the  east  side  of 
Broadway,  between  Pearl  and  Worth  Streets,  is  in  the  midst  of  the  great  wholesale  dry- 
goods  trade. 

The  business  of  the  house  is  thoroughly  systematized,  each  partner  giving  to  it  his 
personal  attention,  in  some  special  direction.  The  employees  in  all  the  departments 
number  about  four  hundred  and  fifty. 

A  large  and  well-assorted  stock  is  kept  at  all  seasons,  comprising  foreign  and  domestic 
dress  goods,  silks,  velvets,  hosiery,  notions,  white  goods,  linens,  laces,  shawls,  cloaks, 
woolens,  flannels,  blankets,  prints,  ginghams,  domestics,  and  an  unusually  large  variety 
of  carpets  and  mattings,  floor  oilcloths  and  upholstery  goods. 

Acting  not  as  commission  merchants,  but  as  direct  traders,  dealing  with  the  chief  man- 
ufacturers both  at  home  and  abroad,  Tefft,  Weller  &amp;  Co.  have  peculiar  advantages  for  the 
safe  and  favorable  conduct  of  their  business,  and  for  its  indefinite  expansion,  whenever 
occasion  arises  therefor.  The  choicest  products  of  the  European  looms  and  workshops  are 
found  in  their  vast  stocks,  as  well  as  the  output  of  hundreds  of  American  factories,  favored 
by  the  new  birth  of  industrial  activity  in  the  United  States. 

Tefft,  Weller  &amp;  Co.  enjoy  facilities  for  securing  every  possible  advantage  in  the  pur- 
chase of  goods,  both  in  home  and  foreign  markets, 'and  are  always  in  a  position  to  take 
excellent  care  of  their  customers — a  fact  which,  judging  from  their  constantly  growing 
business,  the  trade  appreciate.

That  is  the  number  of  copies  already  published,  and  that  is,  indeed, 
a  great  quantity  of  a  book.  But  that  is  the  number  now  published 
of  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY."  It  has 
gone  into  every  country  on  the  globe.  It  is  worth  its  cost  to  every 
New  Yorker  and  all  who  live  around  New  York.  Anyone  wanting 
to  know  anything  about  the  Metropolis  of  America  can  find  more 
text  and  a  greater  number  of  illustrations  in  this  one  book  than  in 
any  other  ten  combined.  It  has  1008  handsomely  printed  pages, 
with  1029  photographic  illustrations.  It  is  substantially  and  beauti- 
fully bound.  And  yet  it  costs  only  Two  Dollars.  As  Robert  G. 
Ingersoll  says  :  "  It  is  good  enough  for  anybody,  and  cheap  enough 
for  everybody."  MOSES  KING,  Publisher,

F.  A.  FERRIS  &amp;  COMPANY. 

AMERICA'S   WORLD-FAMOUS   PACKING    ESTABLISHMENT. 

[From  "KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK."] 

F.  A.  Ferris  &amp;  Company,  whose  name  is  a  household  word  in  the  homes  of  this 
nation,  are  conducting  a  gigantic  business  that  was  begun  three-quarters  of  a  century  ago. 
In  1818,  a  stout  German  lad  of  nineteen  years  landed  from  a  sailing  vessel,  and  walked  up 
Broadway  without  a  penny  in  his  pocket.  Industry,  integrity  and  economy  soon  enabled 
this  newcomer,  John  J.  Cape,  to  start  a  little  provision  shop,  and  so  well  did  he  prosper  that 
when  he  was  fifty  years  of  age  he  retired  from  active  business  with  a  comfortable  fortune. 
He  took  pride,  however,  in  having  his  name  remain  in  the  succeeding  firm  of  F.  A.  Ferris  &amp; 
Company  until  the  day  of  his  death.  Through  all  the  exacting  war  times  and  wonderful 
commercial  changes  since  that  day,  the  firm  has  steadily  kept  on  its  way,  extending  its 
business  to  every  part  of  the  world  that  imports  fine  provisions  from  the  United  States,  at  all 
times  laying  as  the  foundation  of  further  success  the  crowding  of  their  product  towards 
absolute  perfection.  One  of  their  maxims  which  has  a  popular  ring,  has  become  known  to 

all  Americans — 
"A  little  higher 

in  price,  but !" 

Their  establish- 
ment, 262,  264, 
266,  268,  270  and 
272  Mott  Street, 
a  plain,  but  sub- 
stantial brick, 
stone-t  rimmed 
business  building 
without,  shows 
within  a  most  in- 
teresting combi- 
nation of  all  that 
science  and  expe- 
rience  have 
taught  concern- 
ing the  fine  cur- 
ing and  smoking 
of  hams  and 
bacon.  The  in- 
tricate processes 
of  changing  the 
fresh  meats  by 
what  is  known  as 
"curing"  into 

the  smoked  hams  and  bacon  which  can  stand  shipment  to  any  ordinary  climate,  now  depend 
fundamentally  upon  the  production  of  cold  by  artificial  means.  One  of  the  most  charming 
machinery  rooms  of  the  country  is  found  in  their  fire-proof  building,  where  they  have  in 
duplicate  the  Pontifex  Refrigerating  Plant.  The  March,  1893,  number  of  Scribner's  Maga- 
zine, in  an  article  entitled  "  Some  Notable  Food  Products,"  gives  a  lucid  description  of  the 
wonderful  work  accomplished  by  this  mechanical  system.  The  Ferris  Building,  standing 
on  the  back-bone  of  the  lower  part  of  New-York  island,  has  three  stones  of  cellars  (excava- 
tions having  been  made  thirty  feet  below  the  curb  through  a  bed  of  fine  cut  sand  and  gravel), 
thus  adding  immensely  to  the  storage  capacity  of  the  firm.  It  can  justly  be  said  that  in  the 
preparation  of  meat-foods  this  is  a  model  establishment.  The  opposite  page  shows  the 
Mott  Street  front  of  the  packing  establishment  of  F.  A.  Ferris  &amp;  Company.

PUBLISHERS. 

The  Churchman's  Building,  opposite  Astor  Library, 

No.  -47    LAKAYKTTE    PLACE, 
NE\V    YORK:. 

TO  READERS. 

The  aim  is  to  make  The  Churchman  an  extremely  acceptable  paper  at 
the  fireside  of  every  home  in  the  land.  Although  it  is  the  acknowledged  rep- 
resentative of  the  Episcopal  Church,  its  general  news,  literature,  illustrations, 
stories,  history,  travels,  discussions,  editorials  and  other  text,  aside  from  its 
distinctive  Church  matters,  make  it  one  of  the  most  voluminous  and  most 
valuable  of  all  the  weekly  periodicals.  As  a  Church  paper  it  furnishes,  aside 
from  its  general  matters,  an  exhaustive  report  and  review  of  everything  of 
importance  that  transpires  in  connection  with  the  Church  in  any  part  of  the 
world.  Its  typography  is  excellent.  It  is  published  in  magazine  form  once  a 
week,  and  makes  an  annual  issue  of  2500  large  quarto  pages.  Its  writers  are 
not  amateurs,  but  scholars  of  the  ripest  and  sincerest  class.  In  quality  and 
quantity  it  furnishes  the  greatest  value  possible  for  its  subscription  price  of 
$3.50  a  year. 

TO  ADVERTISERS. 

The  Churchman,  aside  from  its  general  constituency,  is  the  leading, 
largest,  and  most  widely  circulated  weekly  paper  in  the  Protestant  Episcopal 
Church,  which  has  over  590,000  communicants,  340,000  of  whom  reside  in  the 
New  England  and  Middle  States.  Moreover,  these  communicants  are  the 
wealthy  and  intelligent  people  in  their  communities.  There  are  many  papers 
that  boast  of  huge  circulations,  but  it  is  difficult  to  find  one  the  average  intelli- 
gence of  whose  readers  will  compare  with  that  of  The  Churchman's  regular 
subscribers.  The  advertising  columns  are  constantly  under  the  same  super- 
vision as  the  text  of  the  paper,  to  avoid,  as  far  as  possible,  the  misleading  of 
its  readers.  Experienced  advertisers  know  full  well  the  value  of  its  columns. 
As  its  rates  are  exceedingly  moderate,  considering  the  character  of  the  paper, 
the  extent  and  quality  of  its  circulation,  it  may  be  well  to  give  its  columns  a  trial.

UNION  SQUARE  HOTEL, 

NEW  YORK. 


When  visiting  New  York,  you  will  find  the  UNION  SQUARE 
HOTEL  a  very  desirable  location,  fronting  on  Union  Square  Park, 
corner  i5th  street,  near  Broadway,  in  the  very  center  of  the  fashion- 
able shopping  district,  and  convenient  to  all  theatres  and  principal 
attractions  of  the  city.  This  well  known  Hotel  is  patronized  by  the 
best  people  from  all  parts  of  the  world,  and  having  recently  been 
newly  furnished  and  decorated  throughout,  and  equipped  with  all 
modern  conveniences,  makes  it  one  of  the  most  comfortable  and 
home-like  Hotels  in  the  Metropolis. 

The  UNION  SQUARE  HOTEL  is  run  on  the  European  plan  and 
charges  are  moderate.  For  rates  and  full  particulars,  address,

THE  WESTMINSTER  HOTEL, 

At    Irving    Place    and    Sixteenth    Street— In    One    of    the    Quietest 
and    Most    Aristocratic    Localities    of    New    York. 


^T^HE  WESTMINSTER  HOTEL,  a  picture  of  which  is  present- 
ed on  the  opposite  page,  is  situated  at  the  corner  of  Irving 
Place  and  Sixteenth  Street,  one  of  the  quietest  and  most 
aristocratic  localities  of  New  York.  While  this  is  the  very  centre  of 
the  Metropolis,  being  within  a  block  of  Union  Square,  where  all  the 
great  retail  stores,  the  fashionable  promenades,  the  theatres  and  all 
the  direct  lines  of  transit  by  elevated  and  surface  roads  find  a 
nucleus,  the  immediate  surroundings  of  Irving  Place  are  as  peaceful 
as  a  suburban  resort.  The  advantages  of  such  a  location  are  obvi- 
ous. To  escape  the  bustle,  din  and  confusion  that  characterize  the 
great  thoroughfares  of  New  York  and  yet  be  in  the  midst  of  the 
shopping  and  amusement  centres,  constitute  an  attraction  which  no 
visitor  can  afford  to  ignore. 

The  Westminster,  by  reason  of  its  quiet  elegance,  superior 
cuisine  and  liberal  management,  has  always  enjoyed  a  high  rep- 
utation among  the  old  established  first-class  New  York  hotels.  Its 
many  points  of  superiority  are  often  quoted  by  the  press  of  the  coun- 
try. The  house  has  always  been  distinguished  for  its  exclusiveness  and 
homelike  atmosphere.  A  notable  feature  are  its  arrangements  for  the 
accommodation  of  families  with  children  and  attendants  in  the  West- 
minster apartment  house  which  adjoins  and  connects  with  the  hotel. 

Although  one  of  the  oldest  hostelries  in  New  York,  The  West- 
minster, under  the  progressive  spirit  and  liberal  management  of  Mr. 
E.  N.  Anable,  the  proprietor,  has  always  kept  apace  with  the  trend  of 
modern  innovation,  improvements  and  luxuries.  One  of  its  latest 
attractions  is  an  exquisitely  furnished  coffee  and  smoking  room  fitted 
up  in  Oriental  style  and  illuminated  at  night  by  tiny  electric  lights 
covered  by  red  shades,  where  guests  of  both  sexes  may  retire,  and 
while  the  women  sip  their  after-dinner  coffee  the  men  may  indulge 
in  post-prandial  cigars  or  cigarettes. 

The  Westminster  is  one  of  the  few  remaining  first-class  hotels  con- 
ducted on  the  American  plan,  with  rates  that  are  exceptionally  reason- 
able in  proportion  to  themany  attractions  and  the  excellence  of  the  table. 

The  advantages  of  living  on  the  American  plan  while  in  a 
strange  city  are  many,  chief  among  them  being  the  ability  to  bring 
one's  living  expenses  down  to  a  lower  figure  than  the  European  plan 
will  permit,  and  to  know  in  advance  the  daily  living  expenses.

Churches 


New  York. 


-*- 


The  chapter  on  the  churches 
of  New  York  in  "King's  Hand- 
book" contains  more  than  one 
hundred  pictures  of  the  repre- 
sentative churches  of  every 
denomination.  And  besides 
giving  a  condensed  history  of 
all  the  various  denominations, 
it  gives  a  brief  history  and 
description  of  about  one  hun-

The  Fowler  &amp;  Wells  Co. 

SCIENTISTS   AND   PUBLISHERS. 

[Reprinted  from  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY."] 

The  Fowler  &amp;  Wells  Company  is  a  scientific  institution  that  has  a 
world-wide  reputation.  For  nearly  sixty  years  its  founders  and  owners  have 
maintained  an  office  in  the  city  of  New  York,  and  have  been  the  recognized 
leaders  in  the  phrenological,  physiological  and  hygenic  sciences,  and  for  half 
a  century  they  have  been  the  main  educators  in  these  branches  of  useful  study. 
They  are  classed  in  a  business  way  as  phrenologists  and  publishers,  but  they 
might  well  be  called  a  scientific  and  educational  institution.  They  occupy  the 
building  at  27  East  2ist  Street,  near  Broadway,  where  is  carried  on  the  work 
inaugurated  by  Orson  S.  Fowler  and  Lorenzo  N.  Fowler  in  1835.  These  men 
were  the  first  in  America  to  give  the  science  of  phrenology  a  practical  value 
by  making  special  delineations  of  character.  They  began  work  in  a  small 
way,  but  steadily  increased  its  scope.  In  1843  they  were  joined  by  Samuel  R. 
Wells,  who  subsequently  married  Charlotte  Fowler,  the  sister  of  his  partners. 
In  course  of  time  both  the  Fowlers  withdrew  from  the  house.  Orson,  who 
was  one  of  the  most  famous  phrenologists  of  the  world,  died  in  1887. 
Lorenzo  still  practices  his  profession  in  London.  Mr.  Wells  conducted  the 
business  of  the  original  house  until  his  death,  in  1875,  and  his  widow,  Charlotte 
F.  Wells,  assumed  the  management  until  1884.  Then  the  Fowler  &amp;  Wells 
Company  was  incorporated  which  now  has  as  officers  Charlotte  Fowler  Wells, 
President;  Nelson  Sizer,  Vice-President  and  phrenological  examiner;  Dr.  H. 
S.  Drayton,  Secretary;  Dr.  Edgar  C.  Beall,  general  editor  of  the  company's 
publications  ;  and  W.  L.  Baner,  Treasurer  and  business  manager.  The  Com- 
pany publishes  The  Phrenological  Journal,  of  which  the  ninety-eighth 
volume  has  just  been  completed,  a  number  of  serial  publications,  and  a 
large  list  of  standard  works  on  phrenology,  physiognomy,  ethnology,  physi- 
ology, psychology  and  hygiene. 

It  has  handsome  business  offices  and  spacious  editorial  rooms,  lecture- 
rooms  and  phrenological  parlors,  where  examinations  are  made,  and  charts 
given  daily,  indicating  choice  of  pursuit,  means  of  culture,  etc.  An  outgrowth 
of  the  business  of  the  concern  is  the  American  Institute  of  Phrenology,  which 
was  incorporated  as  an  educational  institution  in  1866.  Among  the  original 
incorporators  were  Horace  Greeley,  Rev.  Dr.  Samuel  Osgood,  Judge  Amos 
Dean,  Henry  Dexter,  Samuel  R.  Wells,  Lester  A.  Roberts,  Edward  P.  Fowler, 
M.  D.,  and  Nelson  Sizer.  Each  year,  beginning  on  the  first  Tuesday  in 
September,  a  course  of  instruction  in  practical  phrenology  is  given  by  a  corps 
of  experts  under  the  direction  of  Prof.  Sizer,  the  President  of  the  Institute. 
An  interesting  feature  in  the  lecture-room  of  the  Fowler  &amp;  Wells  Company's 
building  is  a  large  collection  of  casts  of  the  heads  of  people  who  have  been 
prominent  in  various  ways  in  past  years  ;  also,  skulls  from  many  nations  and 
tribes,  as  well  as  animal  crania,  illustrative  of  phrenology,  and  constituting 
a  free  public  museum,  and  material  for  instruction  in  the  Institute.

[PHOTOGRAVURES    IN    COLORS.] 

PHOTOGRAVURERS  are  of  all  classes  of 
subjects.  An  important  modification  of  this 
process  has  recently  been  perfected  (patent 
applied  for),  by  which  the  delicacy  of  the 
Gelatine  print  is  maintained,  at  the  same 
time  that  great  strength  and  color  is  pro- 
duced in  the  shadows.  The  plates  thus 
made  are  very  durable,  and  show  but  little 
wear  after  many  thousands  of  impressions 
have  been  produced.  Moreover,  they  re- 
quire no  finishing  or  handling  after  having 
been  etched,  and  are  quite  easily  printed. 

AQUARELLES  are  printed  from  Photo- 
gravure plates,  inked  up  locally  in  a  variety 
of  colors.  When  the  whole  of  the  plate  has 
been  so  inked,  the  impression  is  pulled. 
The  results  are  beautiful,  but  the  process  of 
printing  is  exceedingly  slow,  three  or  four 
impressions  a  day,  only,  being  obtainable 
from  a  moderate  sized  plate.

CHROME-GELATINE  is  a  perfected  modifi-

It  is  so  named  from  the  Gelatine  process  of

from  originals  in  color.  The  results,  in  all

RST    FACT 

No  beauty  of  design  or  ornamentation  in  the  furniture  of  any  country 
or  any  century  but  that  finds  its  artistic  reproduction  in  our  furniture. 

(gECOND   FACT 


No  material,  either  wood  or  metal,  that  the  markets  of  the  whole  world 
can  supply,  but  that  is  found  in  our  furniture  in  utmost  perfection. 

HIRD    FACT 


No  skill  of  cabinet  making  to  be  found  on  either  hemisphere  sur-

The  Fifth  Avenue  Hotel, 

The   Largest,   Best  Appointed   and   Most   Liberally    Managed    Hotel   in   New 
York,  with  the  Most  Central  and  Delightful  Location. 

[From  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY."] 

NO  other  hotel  in  the  world  has  ever  entertained  so  many  distinguished  people  as  have 
been  received  at  THE  FIFTH  AVENUE.  Beginning  with  the  Prince  of  Wales 
in  1860,  a  never-ending  procession  of  the  great  men  of  this  and  other  countries  has 
marched  through  its  corridors.  Presidents  of  the  United  States,  United  States  Senators, 
Congressmen,  Governors,  Judges,  Generals,  Admirals,  Emperors,  Princes,  foreign  Ambas- 
sadors, untitled  men  and  women  of  renown  ;  the  list  would  fill  a  volume.  During  the  war 
period  the  Fifth  Avenue  was  aflame  with  patriotism.  At  every  moment  of  popular  excite- 
ment its  corridors  were  thronged.  Army  and  navy  officers  and  the  civil  leaders  congregated 
there,  and  troops  to  and  from  the  front  were  entertained.  More  peaceful  times  witnessed 
other  scenes.  At  the  famous  Peabody  dinner  there,  in  1867,  the  movement  for  the  nomina- 
tion of  Grant  was  started.  The  Emperor  Dom  Pedro,  of  Brazil,  held  court  there.  Prince 
Nareo,  Crown  Prince  of  Siam,  was  entertained  in  1884;  and  in  1881  Prince  Napoleon,  son  of 
"  Plon  Plon,"  and  heir-apparent  to  the  throne  of  France.  President  Arthur  there  received 
the  Corean  Embassy  in  1883.  The  Arcadian  Club  gave  its  great  reception  to  Charlotte 
Cushman  on  the  occasion  of  the  tragedienne's  retirement  from  the  stage.  In  1883  Prince 
Augustine  de  Iturbide  of  Mexico,  the  Marquis  of  Lome  and  the  Malagasy  Envoys  from 
Madagascar  were  there.  In  the  previous  year  came  the  Chinese  Embassy  ;  and  in  1887  the 
Prince  Devowongse  of  the  Siamese  royal  family  and  four  sons  of  the  King  were  entertained. 
These  are  but  a  few  names  picked  from  hundreds  equally  distinguished.  At  the  time  of 
the  Yorktown  celebration,  the  French  and  the  German  delegations  to  this  country  fraternized 
there.  At  the  Centennial  of  1876,  the  Brooklyn  Bridge  opening,  the  one  hundredth  anni- 
versary of  the  institution  of  the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  the  Washington  Centennial 
in  1889,  the  funeral  days  of  Grant,  Arthur  and  Sherman,  the  laying  of  the  corner  stone  of 
the  Grant  monument— the  story  is  always  the  same,  of  the  concentration  at  the  Fifth  Avenue 
of  the  most  distinguished  participants  in  the  event,  from  the  President  and  his  Cabinet 
down.  The  London  Times,  in  speaking  of  the  gathering  at  Grant's  funeral  in  1885,  said  that 
it  was  the  most  noted  assembly  of  distinguished  Americans  ever  brought  together,  and  the 
same  description  would  apply  to  many  another  occasion  there.  From  all  this  it  has  come 
that  the  Fifth  Avenue  is  a  sort  of  clearing-house  for  the  city,  the  nation  and  the  world. 
Everybody  who  wishes  to  keep  in  touch  with  the  men  of  the  day  must  frequent  its  corri- 
dors, and  on  occasions  of  political  excitement,  financial  crises  and  startling  events,  it  is  the 
center  of  information  and  interest.  There  are  other  kinds  of  patronage  to  the  house. 
Bankers  and  men  of  affairs  congregate  there  to  evolve  and  develop  financial  enterprises,  and 
associations  in  many  branches  of  production  and  trade  hold  their  meetings  there.  And  such 
is  the  size  and  arrangement  of  the  house  that  the  quiet  home-like  character  is  always  main- 
tained, removed  from  and  undisturbed  by  its  more  public  functions,  and  particularly  agree- 
able to  the  many  ladies  and  families  who  come  there.  Both  location  and  management  have 
contributed  to  this  prosperity.  The  house  fronts  upon  Madison  Square,  the  most  charming 
of  the  smaller  parks  of  the  city,  at  the  junction  of  Broadway  and  Fifth  Avenue,  the  two 
great  thoroughfares.  It  covers  eighteen  city  lots,  more  ground  than  any  other  metropolitan 
hotel,  and  is  unequalled  in  the  number  and  spaciousness  of  its  corridors,  halls  and  public 
rooms  and  the  commodious  character  of  its  guest-rooms.  Spread  out  over  so  much  ground, 
there  is  an  agreeable  air  of  roominess  in  the  Fifth  Avenue.  The  second  floor,  with  its  mag- 
nificent arrangement  of  parlors,  foyer  and  grand  dining-room,  is  unequalled  elsewhere. 
The  management  of  the  hotel  (Hitchcock,  Darling  &amp;  Co.)  has  not  changed  since  it  was 
opened  in  1859.  The  house  abundantly  deserves  the  praise  which  James  T.  Fields  once 
recorded  as  having  been  unanimously  bestowed  upon  it  by  a  party  of  veteran  travelers,  of 
being  "  the  best  hotel  in  the  world."

Hoffman  HOUSP, 

MADISON    SQUARE, 
NEW  YORK. 

©pening,  $wst  Day  of  January,  J895. 


'ST'HIS  well-known  Hostelry  was  reopened  the  first  day  of 
•*•  January,  1895.  During  the  preceding  six  months  the  es- 
tablishment was  rebuilt  and  modernized,  so  that  in  all  its  nu- 
merous appointments  it  compares  favorably  with  any  hotel  in 
the  world. 

^PHE  Hoffman  House  fronts  on  Broadway  and  Madison 
Square,  enjoying  the  most  delightful  and  important  location 
in  this  city,  in  the  midst  of  the  great  shopping  and  amusement 
district.  Its  location  is  unsurpassed,  and  the  management  feel 
that  they  can  extend  to  ladies  and  families  many  conveniences 
and  comforts  not  found  elsewhere. 


'ST'HE  New  Addition  to  the  Hoffman  is  ten  stories  in  height, 
•*•  and  of  steel  and  marble,  and  in  all  respects  in  keeping  with 
the  rest  of  the  property.  In  re-building  it  was  designed  that 
guests  should  have  perfect  security  from  fire,  and  with  that  in 
view,  the  laundry,  boilers,  steam  engines  and  dynamos  were  re- 
moved from  the  Hotel  to  premises  on  Twenty-fourth  Street  pur- 
chased expressly  for  that  purpose. 


®lpHE  Refrigerating  Plant  is  of  the  most  approved  order,  and 
•*•      capable  of  making  twenty  tons  of  pure  ice  daily.    The  entire 
plumbing  system  was  newly  constructed  according  to  the  latest 
sanitary  requirements.    

"CLECTRIC  LIGHTS  are  used  exclusively,  and  generated  by 
a  plant  of  capacity  of  six  thousand  lights.  Telephones  for 
convenience  of  guests  connect  the  main  Hotel  office  with  every 
hallway  throughout  the  Hotel.  Turkish  and  Russian  baths  on 
the  premises.

Grand  Union  Hotel, 

OPPOSITE  THE  GRAND  CENTRAL  STATION,  NEW  YORK. 


[Reprinted  from  "  KING'S  HANDBOOK  OF  NEW  YORK  CITY."] 

The  Grand  Union  Hotel  (European  Plan)  is  located  at  Fourth  Avenue 
and  42d  Street,  just  across  the  street  from  the  Grand  Central  Station.  It  is 
architecturally  unassuming,  but  it  is  very  large,  its  dimensions  being  200  by 
135  feet.  It  contains  over  500  sleeping-rooms,  and  does  the  largest  business 
of  any  hotel  in  New  York  in  respect  to  the  number  of  guests  entertained. 
The  features  which  first  strike  the  visitor  to  the  hotel  are  its  cleanliness  and 
quaintness,  and  an  air  of  home  comfort  which  is  lacking  in  many  hotels. 
The  walls  of  the  public  rooms  are  covered  with  paintings,  mostly  by 
American  artists,  of  a  high  order  of  excellence.  There  are  also  a  number 
of  examples  of  foreign  schools,  purchased  by  the  proprietors  at  the  Paris 
Salon.  One  of  the  cafes  is  devoted  to  curious  old  colored  prints,  and  another 
to  prints  relating  to  the  early  history  of  New  York.  Several  large  rooms 
on  the  ground  floor  are  set  apart  for  reading  and  writing,  and  are  abun- 
dantly supplied  with  stationery,  books,  papers  and  illustrated  periodicals. 
This  is  a  popular  feature  with  the  traveling  public,  who  appreciate  having 
a  comfortable  place  in  which  to  lounge,  read  and  write.  The  hotel  has  the 
reputation  of  being  one  of  the  most  profitable  in  the  country. 

Simeon  Ford,  the  senior  proprietor,  having  been  asked  to  account  for 
the  continued  and  growing  success  of  the  Grand  Union,  in  spite  of  the 
building  of  many  new  and  elegant  hotels,  said  :  "In  the  first  place,  we  have 
a  location  which,  for  transient  business,  is  unique.  We  are  just  across  the 
street  from  the  Grand  Central  Station,  and  travelers,  instead  of  having  to 
struggle  with  hackmen  and  expressmen,  can  step  across  to  our  house,  and 
we  deliver  their  baggage  in  their  rooms  in  a  few  minutes  without  charge. 
Then,  again,  we  have  a  moderate-priced  house.  We  give  a  nice  room  for  a 
dollar  a  day,  but,  if  people  want  to  pay  more,  we  have  handsome  suites 
which  cost  four  or  five  dollars  a  day.  Our  food  is  of  the  best  quality 
obtainable,  and  well-cooked  ;  and  we  don't  ask  enough  for  it  to  bankrupt 
a  man.  We  are  cranks  on  the  subject  of  cleanliness.  We  are  eternally 
scrubbing  and  mopping.  Then  again  we  are  within  easy  distance  of  all 
the  best  shops  and  theatres.  But,  above  all,  we  attribute  our  success  to 
the  fact  that  we  try  to  take  good  care  of  our  guests  and  make  them  feel 
at  home,  and  we  try  our  best  to  impress  upon  our  employees  that  we  get 
our  living  out  of  the  traveling  public,  and  that  they  are  entitled  to  some 
consideration,  and  when  our  employees  do  not  agree  with  us  on  this  point 
we  ask  them  to  'seek  fresh  fields  and  pastures  new'."

POTTIER   &amp;   STYMUS   CO. 

High   Art   Furniture,   Furnishings  and    Decorations. 

Pettier  &amp;  Stymus  Company  is  one  of  the  best  known  houses  in  their 
line.  Their  reputation  is  world  renowned,  their  business  extending  from  New 
York  to  California,  and  they  have  also  had  extensive  dealings  with  patrons  in 
Europe.  The  superior  grades  of  furniture  and  woodwork  which  they  manu- 
facture have  made  them  famous.  The  articles  which  they  manufacture  are 
made  from  designs  of  their  own,  the  production  of  the  most  skilled  artists  and 
artisans,  or  from  designs  of  architects. 

Their  factory  and  warerooms  are  situated  at  the  northeast  corner  of  Forty- 
first  Street  and  Lexington  Avenue,  and  are  the  most  complete  of  their  kind  in 
the  United  States.  The  buildings  are  of  brick  and  iron  and  completely  fire- 
proof, well-lighted  and  equipped  with  facilities  that  are  unsurpassed  for  the 
manufacture  of  their  high  grade  work.  One  of  the  chief  advantages  of  having 
the  warerooms  and  factory  combined  is  that  a  personal  supervision  can  be 
given  by  the  different  heads  of  the  company  to  all  work  during  its  progress, 
from  inception  to  finish,  and  they  are  also  enabled  to  reduce  the  cost  of  their 
manufacturing  to  a  minimum. 

Among  many  of  the  richest  and  finest  private  residences  in  America  that 
have  been  furnished  by  this  company  can  be  mentioned  those  of  Henry  M, 
Flagler,  William  Rockefeller,  J.  A.  Bostwick,  John  D.  Archbold,  Wallace  C. 
Andrews,  Fred.  T.  Steinway,  and  M.  C.  D.  Borden,  of  New  York  ;  George 
Westinghouse,  Jr.,  of  Pittsburgh  and  Lenox;  Robert  Pitcairn,  of  Pittsburgh; 
William  Williams,  Myron  P.  Brush  and  William  G.  Fargo,  of  Buffalo  ;  Mark 
Hopkins,  Leland  Stanford,  James  Flood,  Charles  Crocker  and  Henry  J. 
Crocker,  of  San  Francisco;  Mrs.  C.  H.  Strong,  of  Erie,  Pa.,  and  Mrs.  N. 
Willis,  of  Galveston,  Tex. 

They  have  also  contributed  greatly  to  the  furnishing  and  decorating  of  the 
large  hotels  of  New  York  and  other  cities — the  Fifth  Avenue,  Savoy,  Plaza, 
and  Astor's  magnificent  new  Hotel  Waldorf.  In  the  latter  they  furnished  the 
celebrated  State  Apartments  which  were  occupied  by  the  Duke  of  Veragua  in 
1893  ;  also  the  Renaissance,  Colonial,  Empire  and  other  suites,  which  are 
regarded  as  the  most  sumptuously  furnished  and  decorated  hotel  rooms  on 
either  continent.  The  principal  part  of  the  celebrated  Ponce  de  Leon  Hotel 
at  St.  Augustine  was  furnished  by  them,  and  also  the  grand  staircase  in  the 
Royal  Poinciania  Hotel,  Lakeworth,  Florida. 

The  principal  rooms  in  the  President's  Palace,  at  Chepultepec,  Mexico, 
were  furnished  by  this  company,  against  competition  from  France  and  England. 

The  business  was  founded  in  1856  by  Auguste  Pottier  and  William  P. 
Stymus,  and  in  1871  it  was  merged  into  a  corporation.  The  present  officers 
are  William  P.  Stymus,  Jr.,  President,  son  of  William  P.  Stymus,  one  of  the 
founders  of  the  original  house  ;  Frank  R.  Pentz,  Vice-President  and  Treasurer  ; 
and  William  P.  Stymus,  Secretary. 

There  is  a  growing  desire  for  individuality  and  distinction  in  decoration 
and  furniture.  A  wide  scope  for  originality  and  beauty  in  such  things  is 
offered  by  such  a  concern  as  Pottier  &amp;  Stymus  Co.  It  gives  a  much  needed 
relief  from  the  stereotyped  designs  of  ready-made  furniture,  which  is  of 
necessity  designed  and  made  to  please  the  great  number  of  people.  In  such  a 
case  the're  can  be  no  other  distinct  style  adopted,  and  the  result  is  the  mongrel 
and  commonplace  production. 

Just  as  essential  as  an  architect  in  the  placing  and  construction  of  the  structu  re 
is  the  artist  in  the  designing  and  manufacturing  of  the  furnishing  and  decora- 
tions. In  this  latter  field  stands  pre-eminent  the  house  of  Pottier  &amp;  Stymus  Co,

It  is  conducted  by  Miss  Annie  Brown,  a  graduate  of  Vassar,  and  one  of 
the  most  capable  educators  in  this  field  of  work.  In  all  the  improved  methods 
of  education  and  the  demands  of  a  progressive  period,  this  school  stands  in  the 
front  rank.  Its  aim  is  to  provide  thorough  systematic  training.  There  may 
be  differences  of  opinion  as  to  what  subjects  should  be  taught  ;  there  can  be 
little  question  as  to  the  requirements  for  good  teaching  in  any  line.  Parents 
have  the  right  to  expect  that  a  school  should  give  habits  of  intelligent  study, 
promptness,  and  accuracy  of  thought  and  speech.  Every  department  is 
provided  with  a  competent  and  experienced  teacher,  possessing  the  highest 
grade  of  qualifications.  In  that  of  modern  languages  six  native  instructors 
are  employed  and  five  in  the  college  preparatory  course.  There  are  twenty- 
five  instructors  in  all,  at  the  head  of  whom  presides  Miss  Brown. 

Three  courses  of  study  are  open  :  the  regular  course  to  graduation,  the 
preparatory  course  to  Vassar,  Radcliffe,  Barnard,  Wellesley,  Bryn  Mawr  and 
Smith,  and  the  special  course  for  those  who  have  graduated  elsewhere,  or  who 
desire  to  study  special  branches.  Careful  attention  is  given  each  student, 
and  her  peculiar  aptitudes  and  tastes  are  studied  and  developed.  No  strict 
rules  are  made  to  hamper  the  pupil's  advancement — no  marks  or  awards  given 
or  punishments  inflicted — but  each  is  made  to  feel  that  the  good  name  of  the 
school  rests  with  her  to  maintain.  About  150  pupils  are  annually  enrolled. 
They  are  drawn  not  only  from  New  York  City  and  its  environments  but  from 
every  quarter  of  the  United  States.  At  frequent  intervals  the  boarders  visit 
the  Lenox  Library,  the  Art  Museum,  Museum  of  Natural  History,  die 
Academy  of  Design  and  other  museums  and  galleries. 

Thorough  work  is  done  in  the  primary  and  preparatory  departments 
where  the  pupils  are  day  scholars  who  expect  to  complete  the  course. 
Through  their  consistent  development  Miss  Brown  aims  at  a  high  standard 
in  all  the  advanced  classes,  for  the  strength  of  the  school  lies  in  the  unity  of 
the  day-school.

What  is  Home  without 

"King's  Handbook  of  New  York  City?" 


A  T  its  small  cost  you  can  find  no  article  of  ornament  or  pleasure 
**  which  gives  to  the  whole  household  so  much  information,  grati- 
fication and  relaxation  as  is  afforded  by  a  copy  of  "  King's  Handbook 
of  New  York  City."  Not  only  the  folks  at  home,  but  your  guests  and 
your  visitors  will  heartily  enjoy  it.  It  costs  only  two  dollars,  and 
after  it  has  been  in  the  house  awhile  each  member  of  the  family  will 
know  more  about  the  city  in  which  you  live  and  of  which  you  are  a 
part  than  the  whole  combined  family  knew  before.  It  is  not  a  mere 
glimpse  at  the  city;  it  is  a  thorough  and  accurate  description  of  the 
whole  metropolis  arranged  into  chapters  by  topics,  which  are  subdi- 
vided into  paragraphs  by  institutions  or  subjects,  and  at  the  close  is 
an  elaborate  alphabetically  arranged  index,  giving  instant  access  to 
any  bit  of  desired  information.  Embodied  in  these  1008  pages  of 
information,  historical  and  descriptive,  are  1029  photographic  illus- 
trations, which  never  fail  to  interest  old  and  young  people,  for  it 
instantly  makes  known  to  them  buildings,  views  and  institutions  which 
they  would  otherwise  pass  by  unnoticed.  Just  as  one  who  is  unable 
to  distinguish  between  the  thousands  of  shades,  colors,  shapes  and 
varieties  of  the  foliage  or  flowerage  and  other  bits  of  nature,  fails  to 
find  delight  in  the  country,  so,  too,  the  resident  or  visitor  who  does 
not  know  the  thousands  of  objects  of  interest  of  every  conceivable 
character,  is  not  likely  to  find  delight  in  the  city.  Know  your  city 
and  its  wonders,  and  you  must  surely  take  pride  in  being  a  citizen. 
Get  "  King's  Handbook  "  and  you  will  soon  know  your  city.

New  York's  Newest,  Daintiest  and  most   Charming   Hotel

GRAND   BOULEVARD  AND  SIXTY-SIXTH  STREET, 
NEW   YORK. 


AMERICAN  AND  EUROPEAN  PLANS. 


ABSOLUTELY  FIRE-PROOF. 


A.   EUGENE   KIRBY,  Proprietor. 


NOTE. —  The  New  York  Tribune  recently 
gave  a  two- column  description  of  the  new- 
est of  the  grand  New  York  Hotels — THE 
MARIE  ANTOINETTE.  Here  it  is  only  pos- 
sible to  reprint  the  headlines  and  a  few 
extracts  of  the  Tribune's  description  : 


HOTEL    MARIE    ANTOINETTE. 


The  Charm  and  Refinement  of  Versailles 
Translated  to  Manhattan  Island. 


A  New  White  Palace  which  at  least  realizes 
the  Ideals  of  Discriminating  New  Yorkers. 


An  inadequate  description  of  a  Beautiful 
Structure. 


'A  new  structure  has  recently  been  com- 
pleted in  New  Vork  which  has  benefited 
by  a  happy  inspiration.  Marie  Antoinette 
was  a  brilliant,  beautiful  woman,  but  she 
was  a  home-loving  queen.  The  hotel, 
which  has  been  so  fittingly  named  after 
her,  and  in  illustration  of  all  that  is  most 
exquisite  in  life,  realizes  the  best  ideas  of 
art  and  comfort. 

"Approaching  the  Hotel  Marie  Antoi- 
nette from  the  Sixty-sixth  Street  station  of 
the  Elevated  Road,  the  effect  produced 
upon  the  observer  is  that  of  some  beau- 
tiful building  from  the  White  City  of  the 
World's  Fair.  The  proportions  of  the 
building  are  such  as  to  give  the  effect  of 
height,  without  appearing  to  scrape  the 
sky,  and  standing  on  the  corner  with  ample 
frontage,  both  on  the  Boulevard  and  Sixty- 
sixth  Street,  it  is  massive  and  substantial. 

"  The  Tribune  man,  as  he  passed  through 
the  beautiful  wrought-iron  gates  into  the 
main  hall  which  led  to  the  restaurant  and 
dining-room  on  the  right,  and  the  private 
dining-room,  ante-chamber  and  drawing- 
room  on  the  left,  was  fairly  at  a  loss  where 
to  begin  his  description  of  a  unique  edifice. 
It  is  obvious  at  a  glance  that  the  most 
lavish  expenditure  had  been  made  to  bring 


about  a  consistent  application  of  the  best 
art  principles  adapted  to  the  conveniences 
and  requirements  of  modern  life. 

"Take,  for  instance,  the  main  dining- 
room.  Is  there  just  such  a  room  in  all  New 
York,  and,  indeed,  anywhere?  A  room 
neither  too  square  nor  too  long,  supported 
by  columns  of  colored  alabaster,  heightened 
with  gold  Corinthian  capitals.  The  color 
scale  of  the  walls,  modulating  through  suc- 
cessive tints  of  rose  and  crush  strawberry, 
suitably  harmonized  from  ceiling  to  floor, 
diffuses  the  brightest  kind  of  rose-colored 
light  suddenly  relieved  by  the  rich  dark 
green  of  the  portieres  which  shut  off  the 
street.  These  portieres,  serving  in  them- 
selves an  eminently  useful  purpose,  also 
suggest  and  introduce  the  contrast  between 
the  dining-room  and  the  drawing-room, 
which  has  already  been  given  a  name — the 
Oak  Room. 

"  The  Oak  Room  of  the  Hotel  Antoinette 
will  long  be  one  of  the  things  to  see  in 
New  York.  Every  piece  is  an  heirloom. 
What  would  not  Henry  Irving  give  for 
even  two  or  three  of  these  old  "pieces," 
some  of  them  costing  a  small  fortune,  with 
which  to  stage  the  palace  of  the  king  in 
some  play  of  Shakespeare  ?  But,  beautiful 
as  they  are,  they  serve  a  fundamental  pur- 
pose. The  oak  room  suggests  the  repose 
of  home,  just  as  the  dining-room,  in  rose 
and  gold,  suggests  the  gayety  of  social  life 
in  this  great  commercial  city  of  ours,  fast 
becoming  the  greatest  commercial  city  of 
the  world. 

"  What  should  be  said  of  the  restaurant, 
which  is  only  second  to  the  dining-room  in 
importance  because  of  being  somewhat 
smaller  in  size?  Here  the  same  charm  of 
color  and  of  light.  You  feel  that  this  room 
is  a  little  cosier,  perhaps,  than  the  dining- 
hall,  but  it  is  quite  up  to  the  standard,  and 
that  is  saying  a  good  deal.  A  unique  fea- 
ture of  the  restaurant,  and  one  which  gives 
its  own  character  to  the  total  effect,  is  the 
introduction  of  shaded  electric  lamps,  com- 
ing up  through  the  middle  of  each  table, 
like  flowers  of  light.  The  value  of  light, 
and  as  much  light  as  possible,  has  been 
fully  appreciated  by  the  experienced  men 
who  have  planned  and  carried  out  the 
Hotel  Marie  Antoinette."

(OLD  BUILDING,  OCCUPIED  UNTIL  1894). 


68th    STREET, 

BET.    9TH    AVE.    AND   THE    BOULEVARD. 

IS  useful  institution  is  of  interest  not 
only  for  its  prominence  among  scientific 
schools,  but  as  the  incentive  to  essential 
reforms  in  the  practice  of  pharmacy,  and  in  the 
thorough  education  of  men  to  compound  and 
dispense  medicines  throughout  the  land.  The 
College  of  Pharmacy  was  founded  in  1829  and 
incorporated  in  1831.  For  many  years  it  occupied 
a  building  in  23d  Street,  but  in  1894  it  began 
to  occupy  its  present  commodious,  well-equipped, 
modern  fire-proof  edifice  on  68th  Street,  near  the 
Boulevard.  It  originated  in  modest  beginnings 
and  slowly  developed  through  the  unaided  efforts 
of  a  small  group  of  earnest  New  York  druggists, 
many  of  whom  have  now  passed  away.  It  was 
maintained  in  spite  of  many  difficulties  and  dis- 
couragements, and  stands  to-day  as  an  enduring 
monument  of  the  patience  and  perseverance  of 
the  founders  and  the  liberality  and  ability  of  their 
successors.  Years  ago  the  application  of  tests  in 
due  course  by  a  student,  who  has  since  filled  the 
president's  chair,  led  to  the  discovery  ol  the  most 


audacious  frauds  by  some  unprincipled  importers  and  wholesalers,  who  supplied  the  western 
and  southern  druggists.  The  members,  espousing  the  cause  of  pure  drugs,  promoted  to  the 
presidency  the  one  who,  from  purely  philanthropic  motives,  had  been  most  active  in  ferret- 
ing out  these  frauds,  and  against  whom  the  guilty  parties  instituted  suits  for  his  action, 
although  he  waged  war  sdlely  against  a  flagrant  abuse  and  not  at  all  against  individuals. 
During  his  presidency  the  College  was  actively  instrumental  in  bringing  about  the  benefi- 
cent law  of  1848,  prohibiting  the  importation  of  adulterated,  deteriorated,  inferior  or 
spurious  drugs.  To  enforce  these  he  called  the  committees  in  1851  that  initiated  the 
American  Pharmaceutical  Association,  which  now  has  1600  members. 

The  principles  enunciated  by  this  College  in  its  requirements  for  graduation,  and  in 
its  code  of  ethics,  have  been  generally  adopted  by  other  pharmaceutical  bodies.  It  partici- 
pates regularly  in  the  decennial  revision  of  the  U.  S.  Pharmacopoeia.  In  1883  it  promulgated 
the  N.  Y.  and  Brooklyn  Formulary,  which  has  been  further  elaborated  to  form  the  "  National 
Formulary,"  published  by  the  American  Pharmaceutical  Association.  A  brilliant  record, 
especially  for  so  modest  an  institution  that  few  except  those  concerned  know  of  its  existence. 

The  officers  for  the  current  year  are  as  follows:  President,  Samuel  W.  Fairchild  ;  Vice- 
Presidents,  Prof.  Charles  F.  Chandler,  George  Massey  and  John  Caswell ;  Treasurer, 
Horatio  N.  Fraser  ;  Secretary,  J.  Niven  Hegeman  ;  and  Trustees,  Charles  Holzhauer,  Wm. 
M.  Massey,  Wm.  Jay  Schieffelin,  Charles  F.  Schleussner,  Henry  Schmid,  Samuel  J.  Bendiner, 
Theodore  Louis,  Thomas  F.  Main,  Domingo  Peraza,  Reuben  R.  Smith,  Hermon  W.  Atwood, 
Thomas  J.  Macmahan,  Gustavus  Ramsperger,  Charles  Rice,  George  B.  Wray.  The  faculty 
comprises  ten  members,  including  four  professors— Charles  F.  Chandler,  Arthur  H.  Elliott, 
Henry  H.  Rusby,  Virgil  Coblentz— and  six  instructors,  besides  whom  there  are  many  special 
lecturers.  The  institution  covers  a  complete  course,  theoretical  and  practical,  and  the  lec- 
tures, quizzes  and  laboratory  work  include  all  the  important  subjects  necessary  or  desirable 
for  the  pharmacist.

ADVANTAGES    OF 

Warren's  Anchor  Brand 
Natural  Asphalt  Roofing 

OVER 

COAL  TAR  ROOFING. 

FIRST  :— Very  much  greater  durability,  caused  principally  by  the  fact  that  the  oils  in  the 
Asphalt  are  non-volatile  at  any  natural  temperature,  and  the  Anchor  Brand  Cement,  there- 
fore, does  not  dry  up  and  become  brittle  under  exposure  to  sun  and  air,  as  Coal  Tar  Pitch  does, 
in  which  the  oils  are  very  volatile. 

SECOND  : — The  Anchor  Brand  Cement  will  not  run,  it  being  less  affected  by  the  heat  of  the 
sun  than  Coal  Tar  Pitch. 

THIRD  : — The  Anchor  Brand  Cement  has  more  body  than  Coal  Tar  Pitch,  and  is  a  very 
much  stronger  and  more  tenacious  cement. 

FOURTH  : — An  Anchor  Brand  roof  emits  no  disagreeable  odor,  and  does  not  injure  rain 
water. 

Advantages  of  Warren's  Anchor  Brand  Natural  Asphalt  Roofing 

OVER    TIN    ROOFING. 

CHKAFXKSS. 

FIRST: — The  first  cost  of  the  Anchor  Brand  roof  is  less.  While  tin  roofs  are  offered  in  all 
parts  of  the  country  at  from  $4.00  to  $9.00  per  square,  the  best  grades  of  tin  plate  cannot  be  laid 
for  less  than  the  latter  figure. 

SECOND  : — The  Anchor  Brand  Roof  requires  no  expense  for  its  continued  preservation, 
while  tin  must  be  frequently  painted. 

THIRD  : — The  cost  of  painting  a  tin  roof  during  its  lifetime,  added  to  the  already  greater 
first  cost,  makes  it  far  more  expensive  than  an  Anchor  Brand  roof  for  the  same  length  of  time. 

DURABILITY. 

FIRST  :— An  Anchor  Brand  roof  is  not  injuriously  affected  by  the  changes  in  temperature , 
while  the  contraction  and  expansion  of  a  tin  roof  under  similar  circumstances  are  often  sufficient 
to  cause  it  to  buckle,  and  leak  at  the  seams. 

SECOND  : — An  Anchor  Brand  roof  requires  no  attention  to  insure  its  durability.  A  tin  roof, 
on  the  contrary,  should  the  painting  be  neglected,  rapidly  deteriorates. 

THIRD  : — An  Anchor  Brand  roof,  where  subjected  to  gases,  acids  or  moisture  from  beneath, 
is  far  more  durable  than  a  tin  roof,  which,  under  these  conditions,  is  almost  worthless. 

FOURTH  : — An  Anchor  Brand  roof  is  more  substantial  than  a  tin  roof,  and  less  easily  injured 
by  being  walked  upon,  and  by  other  external  causes. 

FIFTH  :— An  Anchor  Brand  roof  offers  a  much  more  thorough  protection  from  fire  either 
from  within  or  without  the  building  than  does  a  tin  roof,  as  the  latter  quickly  unsolders,  admit- 
ting a  draft  of  air,  while  the  former  remains  perfectly  air  tight.

Warren  Chemical  &amp;  M'F'G  Co. 

81-83  Fulton  Street.  New  Vork  City. 
Gentlemen:  -- 

This  is  to  certify  that  this  piece  of  roof  was 
cut  from  the  roof  of  the  West  Shore  Railroad  freight  house,  Pier 
2,  Weehawken,  N.  J.,  on  April  4th,  1893.  This  building  was  covered 
in  the  Summer  of  1882  with  Warren's  Anchor  Brand  Natural  Asphalt 
Roofing;  it  has  thus  stood  the  wear  of  eleven  years,  has  given 
perfect  satisfaction,  and  is  now  in  excellent  condition. 

Two  Pier  Sheds  were  covered  with  this  material,  one  is  200 
by  775  and  the  other  is  200  x  1350. 

Both  roofs  are  in  good  condition,  and  to  all  appearances  are 
likely  to  last  from  ten,  to  fifteen  years  longer.  The  asphalt  roof- 
ing cement  retains  its  elastic  qualities  to  a  remarkable  extent. 

Yours  truly,

COMMISSIONERS'    CERTIFICATE. 

NEW  YORK  CITY,  November  28,  1894. 

We,  the  Insurance  Commissioners  and  Superintendents  of  the  States  of  Massachusetts,  Illinois, 
Kansas,  Kentucky,  Missouri,  Ohio  and  Texas,  pursuant  to  the  invitation  of  the  President  of  the  Company, 
dated  June  1,  1894,  do  hereby  certify  that  we  have  been  for  the  past  four  months  engaged  in  a  thorough 
and  searching  official  investigation  into  the  affairs  of  the  New  York  Life  Insurance  Company  of  the  City 
of  New  York. 

We  further  certify  that  each  Stock  and  Bond  owned,  each  Collateral  Loan,  each  Bond  and  Mort- 
gage Loan  made,  the  Cash  and  each  Bank  Certificate  of  Deposit,  was  carefully  examined,  checked  and 
verified;  that  the  Policy  Loans  and  Premium  Notes  were  examined  and  checked  with  the  Reserve  on 
each  Policy  ;  that  Interest  and  Rents  due  and  accrued,  unreported  and  Deferred  Premiums,  were  also  verified  ; 
that  the  values  of  Stocks  and  Bonds  owned,  and  Real  Estate  owned,  were  individually  and  closely 
scrutinized  and  conservatively  made  ;  that  the  title  to  each  piece  of  property  secured,  and  Bond  and 
Mortgage  Loan  made  since  the  1891  New  York  State  Insurance  Department  Investigation,  was  examined 
and  found  satisfactory.  That  the  Policy  Reserve  was  checked  and  verified  by  the  Actuaries  of  our 
several  State  Insurance  Departments,  and  that  every  Policy  and  its  Reserve,  on  the  books  of  the  Com- 
pany, was  checked  individually  with  the  Valuation  Policy  Registers  of  the  Massachusetts  Department  ; 
that  all  Sundry  Liabilities  were  also  verified  ;  that  each  debit  and  credit  entry  in  the  Company's  books 
was  checked  from  the  date  of  the  said  New  York  State  Investigation;  and  that  as  a  result,  on  the 
most  conservative  basis  of  valuation,  we  found  tbe  Company  possessed  of  ASSETS  satisfactory 


And  that,  after  providing  for  all  possible  Liabilities,  including  $135.058,291.00  for  outstanding 
Policy  Reserve,  as  per  the  "Combined  Experience  Table  of  Mortality."  with  four  per  cent,  interest,  the 
total  of  the  same  amounted  to  $138,124,363.81. 

We  further  certify   that,  by  the   severest   test,  the   **BT  SURPLUS   to   policy-holders, 
after  providing  for  every  liability,  and  deducting  Agents'  Balances,  was,  on  June  30,  1894, 

$17,339,064.92
