But now the ministry has informed the PHF that the government has given the clearance," the source said.<br /><br />He said given the current tension between the two countries, the PHF had genuine concerns whether they would get clearance to play in India.<br /><br />"The PHF has already set up camp for the junior team in Lahore under the supervision of Olympian Tahir Zaman and they have high hopes that the team would do well in India," the source said.<br /><br />There was more good news for Pakistan hockey as a cheque of 20 million rupees was also released as a special grant by the government for the cash strapped PHF during of a meeting PHF secretary Shahbaz Ahmed had with Pakistan Sports Board officials in Islamabad.<br /><br />The PHF is confident of a good show from its junior team in Lucknow as the under-21 players recently played in the final of a top ranking tournament in Malaysia. They lost 1-3 to Australia but did well overall.<br /><br />Pakistan has in the past taken part in the senior World Cup, Commonwealth Games hockey tournament and Champions Trophy on Indian soil in the last few years. <br /><br /><strong><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/" target="new">The Times of India</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>Hockey India announces men's team for Junior World Cup</strong><br /><br />NEW DELHI: Hockey India on Friday announced an 18-member Indian junior men's team for the Uttar Pradesh Junior World Cup scheduled to be held at Lucknow from December 8 to 18.<br /><br />The team includes drag flicker and defender Harmanpreet Singh, who has been nominated for the 2016 Rising Star of the Year award from the FIH. He was also part of the Indian team that participated in the 2016 Rio Olympics.<br /><br />Known for his abilities as a striker, Mandeep Singh too finds himself in the squad. He was part of India's forward line in the FIH Champions Trophy in London earlier this year where he rose to the occasion scoring three field goals in crucial matches.<br /><br />He will be joined in the forward line by Armaan Qureshi, Parvinder Singh, Gurjant Singh, Ajit Kumar Pandey and Simranjeet Singh.<br /><br />Defender and dragflicker Varun Kumar who scored the maximum goals in India's successful campaign in Valencia will be joined by Vikramjit Singh and Gurinder Singh in the defence structure, while the midfield will be formed by Santa Singh, Nilakanta Sharma, Manpreet, Sumit along with Harjeet Singh.<br /><br />India's custodian in goal will be Vikas Dahiya who was also part of the Indian team at the Rio Olympics as a stand-by goalkeeper for PR Sreejesh. Krishan B Pathak will be the second goalkeeper for India.<br /><br />"The final combination has been formed keeping in mind the recent results. I believe this team combination is the best we have in junior hockey and the boys are ready both mentally and physically to do everything it takes to stand on the podium," said Roelant Oltmans.<br /><br />"Though our goal is to win the gold medal, we will be taking it match-by-match and the best part is that this group knows how to keep their emotions in check," he added.<br /><br />India will begin their campaign against Canada on December 8th and will face England on December 10th and play South Africa on December 12th as part of their Pool D league matches.<br /><br />The matches can be seen live on Star Sports 4 and Star Sports HD 4.<br /><br /><strong>Team:</strong><br /><br />GOALKEEPERS: Vikas Dahiya, Krishan B Pathak<br /><br />DEFENDERS: Dipsan Tirkey, Harmanpreet Singh, Varun Kumar, Vikramjit Singh, Gurinder Singh.<br /><br />MIDFIELDERS: Harjeet Singh, Santa Singh, Nilakanta Sharma Manpreet, Sumit<br /><br />FORWARDS: Parvinder Singh, Gurjant Singh, Armaan Qureshi, Mandeep Singh, Ajit Kumar Pandey, Simranjeet Singh. <br /><br /><strong><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/" target="new">The Times of India</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>We will take it match by match in Junior World Cup: Oltmans</strong><br /><br />BENGALURU: Indian senior hockey team's chief coach Roelant Oltmans said the focus of the junior team is on its opening match in what he thinks will be an unpredictable World Cup beginning in Lucknow next month.<br /><br />"Every tournament we go into we wish for the best possible results. Our focus is that of winning the first match. If we did that we go to the next round. Every team in the last 16 years wanted to win the junior world cup, there is no doubt. We will take game by game and that's what I have always done," Oltmans said on Friday.<br /><br />Asked who would be the tougher side to beat in the tournament, Oltmans said, "It is difficult to say which team is tougher than others, because no team is consistent, now a days. Take for instance, England which lost all their junior players because they crossed the age".<br /><br />The Dutchman is also not worried the possible showdown against Pakistan.<br /><br />"Pakistan is not in our group. We are in Group B and they are in Group D. We might face them, but not before semifinals. For me, it doesn't make any sense to talk about a game between India and Pakistan.<br /><br />"But we will have a long chat a day about it before the match against Pakistan when you all come to Lucknow," he said in a lighter vein.<br /><br />Asked it has been long since Indian junior team has won the World Cup, Harendra said the team can take pride in history, but that alone does not give anything on platter.<br /><br />"Yes, we take pride in history that we once won the world cup (in 2001), but that does not give anything on the plate. We instead have to live in present," he said.<br /><br />Oltmans said the team has two practice games to play against Netherlands and Argentina ahead of the World Cup in Lucknow.<br /><br />Junior coach Harendra Singh said the probables for senior team will be selected from the pool of junior players after the World Cup.<br /><br />"These are a bunch of highly talented players. After the world cup, we will decide on the probables for the senior team from the pool of junior players. For now, we are focusing on the upcoming tournament," he said.<br /><br />Replying to another query, Harendra said both the senior and junior teams practice together and the latter get to learn many things from the former.<br /><br />"For sometime now, the senior and junior teams are playing together or practising together, which helps. It is paying dividends too," he said. <br /><br /><strong><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/" target="new">The Times of India</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>India banking on team of all-rounders</strong><br /><br /><strong>Manuja Veerappa</strong><br /><br />BENGALURU: The Punjabi music on the loudspeaker, which is an integral part of the Indian junior hockey team, played as usual in the background at the SAI, South Centre on Friday.<br /><br />There were a few crestfallen faces among the jubilant ones as Hockey India's High Performance director Roelant Oltmans announced the 18-member squad for the Junior World Cup beginning in Lucknow on December 8.<br /><br />As the core group has been quite set over the past few months, there were no surprises in the squad coached by Harendra Singh. The team's captain and his deputy are yet to be named.<br /><br />The squad has a healthy sprinkling of players who have sparkled in international tournaments both with the senior and junior teams. But the test that awaits them is the pressure of playing a World Cup at home. <br /><br /><strong><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/" target="new">The Times of India</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>Junior Pan Am experience colours approach to World Cup for Canadian youth</strong><br /><br /><strong>Shaheed Devji</strong><br /><br /><img src="http://www.fieldhockey.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/jamiewallace_2016_u21_panam.jpg" width="600" border="0" /><br /><em><strong>Jamie Wallace carries the ball in Canada’s first game at the 2016 Junior Pan American Games in Toronto in May 2016 (By Yan Huckendubler)</strong></em><br /><br />With less than one month to go before the 2016 Men’s Junior World Cup in India, the anticipation is building.<br /><br />Canada’s Under-21 Men’s National Team will be one of sixteen teams looking to claim the title of best junior nation in the world, and with that can come some pressure.<br /><br />But for a group of young athletes who are headed to their first Junior World Cup, the experience of the World Cup qualifier last summer in Toronto has helped calm the nerves.<br /><br />“You really have to play your best each game to get the result,” says 17 year-old Jamie Wallace, who – at 16 – was the youngest player on the Canadian roster at the 2016 Junior Men’s Pan American Championship in Toronto in May.<br /><br />“I didn’t expect the game to be as fast, especially against the lower ranked teams,” he adds. “I was really surprised how good the Mexicans were, how good Trinidad was. It just shows that at the international level, if you have a bad game any team can win.”<br /><br />Canada got off to a less than ideal start at the Pan Ams, losing its first two games.<br /><br />But it was that adversity that helped the likes of Wallace, and teammate Fin Boothroyd, and others like Thomson Harris get their international bearings quickly.<br /><br />“We learned to battle the adversity,” says Boothroyd, who was also playing in his first major international competition at the Pan Ams. “Coming out and losing our first two games was pretty difficult – we were expected to win those ones – and just dealing with the expectations and pushing through it and being cohesive as a team.”<br /><br />It brought the team together. Canada went on to win its next three games and finish with a silver medal and a spot in the Junior World Cup.<br /><br />“The feeling that we were going to go to a Junior World Cup and the excitement around the guys and the coaching staff was just electric,” Boothroyd adds.<br /><br />What’s more, it gave many players a taste of what a top-flight international competition is like and has prepared them for what’s to come in India in December.<br /><br />“I’m excited again. I’m excited to face this new competition and see how we can do,” says Boothroyd. “I sort of have a little bit of experience under my belt internationally now but definitely not at the level we are going to be experiencing in India.”<br /><br />The World Cup will be another step up.<br /><br />And despite it being unknown for all but two of the Canadian men (after playing in 2013, Brandon Pereira and Balraj Panesar will be competing in their second Junior World Cup), the Junior Pan American Games experience will inform how players – especially those who have nothing bigger to compare it to – approach the upcoming competition.<br /><br />“Mentality wise, you can’t really underestimate anyone, especially at the World Cup. All the teams are going to be really good, they’re all going to be really prepared,” says Wallace, who – as a part of Canadian tradition afforded to the youngest player on the team – wore the captain’s arm band in the Gold Medal match in Toronto.<br /><br />Wallace is no longer the youngest on the team – although he is not far off in age. But what he and his teammates have gained in experience will not only help them, but others, who in India, will be in the same boat they were in just months ago.<br /><br />“I definitely feel a bit more ready and experienced,” he says. “I can give some advice to the new guys because I think when they step on the field they’re going to be shocked at how good those guys are.”<br /><br />Canada opens the Junior World Cup against host India on December 8th at 7:00pm local time.<br /><br />Help Canada’s Under-21 along the road to the Junior World Cup.

<p><br /><strong>Bennett "ready for the next chapter."</strong><br /><br /><img src="http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/image-cache/image-15281-orig.jpg" border="0" /><br /><em><strong>Bennett Keegan and Booth celebrate</strong></em><br /><br />This week one of England Hockey’s most well known and well loved team managers stood down from her duties. Melissa Bennett, who was most recently the Women’s U21 Team Manager has taken the decision to move away from her management role in order to spend more time with her family.<br /><br />A popular member of the “team behind the team” at U21 level, Melissa started out as a Futures Cup manager nine years ago when the tournament was still in its infancy. She could not have known then that the path she would take would lead her all the way up to becoming a vital cog in the machine for the U21s.<br /><br />Craig Keegan, the Head Coach of the Women’s U21s who has worked with Melissa said:<br /><br />"Mel significantly contributed to implementing the Single System and managed that process through its first few years. As an England team manager, I have worked with Mel for the past 4 years at U21 level. She is someone that players and staff valued greatly. Mel managed the U21 team that qualified for the 2013 Junior World Cup, where the team finished 4th. She will be greatly missed."<br /><br /><img src="http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/core/core_picker/loadimg.asp?id=15282" width="450" height="338" border="0" /><br /><em><strong>Bennett centre with the rest of the U21 coaching staff</strong></em><br /><br />With the U21s on their way out to Chile right now to compete in the Junior World Cup it will perhaps seem strange to many not to see the familiar face of Bennett out there with the squad, but despite the obvious fear of missing out for the first time in years, she is now ready to move onto the next chapter. She told England Hockey:<br /><br />“When I got involved with team managing I didn't really know what to expect. My first role at Futures Cup turned out to be the start of a nine year journey, ending in managing the U21 England and GB women's teams.”<br /><br />“For me the role was about being a part of a team where my task was to support players and staff to perform at their best. I have worked with very talented players over the years and most importantly watched them all develop from junior players into senior internationals or those starting their careers as professionals. It has been fun, challenging and rewarding and I would like to say thank you to everyone I have worked with. And of course i want to say good luck to the women and men at the Junior World Cups over the next few weeks.”<br /><br />All at England and Great Britain Hockey would like to wish Melissa well and thank her for her superb efforts over the years.<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://www.englandhockey.co.uk/" target="new">England Hockey Board Media release</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>HC Oranje-Rood set for massive Dutch derby</strong><br /><br />The EHL KO16 draw served up a series of potential fireworks with some of the world’s best club sides learning who their opposition will be at Eindhoven’s HC Oranje-Rood from April 14-17, 2017.<br /> <br />The home club HC Orange-Rood have been paired with AH&amp;BC Amsterdam in one of the marquee games of the competition. The Eindhoven club recently beat Amsterdam 3-1 in the Hoofdklasse and so the latter will be keen on a measure of revenge.<br /> <br />The winner of this tie will go on to meet the victor from the meeting of Irish champions Lisnagarvey and Atlètic Terrassa.<br /> <br />German champions Rot Weiss Köln will meet the reigning EHL holders SV Kampong in the KO16 in a repeat of last year’s KO8 meeting. The German side will be looking for a completely different outcome having lost that tie 5-1.<br /> <br />The winner of that game will meet either Polish champions WKS Grunwald Poznan or Real Club de Polo.<br /> <br />It’s an all-Belgian battle for KHC Dragons and Racing Club de Bruxelles. They are another couple of sides who know each other well with this match-up between the two teams who met in their national grand final in the spring.<br /> <br />Their KO8 opponent is guaranteed to be contesting that phase of the competition for the first time. Racing Club de France and Ireland’s Banbridge have both never made it to the last eight of the EHL and so will be eyeing a special piece of history.<br /> <br />English champions Wimbledon have once again been handed a tough draw as they look to get the better of three-time EHL winners UHC Hamburg.<br /> <br />Their section of the draw features Mannheimer HC and Spanish winners Club Egara in what looks another well-matched tussle.<br /> <br />The fixture schedule and ticketing details will be finalised in the coming weeks.<br /> <br /><strong>EHL KO16 draw, April 14 to 17, 2017 – HC Oranje-Rood, Eindhoven:</strong><br /> <br />HC Oranje-Rood vs AH&amp;BC Amsterdam<br />Lisnagarvey vs Atlètic Terrassa<br />Wimbledon vs UHC Hamburg<br />Mannheimer HC vs Club Egara<br />KHC Dragons vs Racing Club de Bruxelles<br />Banbridge vs Racing Club de France<br />WKS Grunwald Poznan vs Real Club de Polo de Barcelona<br />SV Kampong vs Rot-Weiss Köln<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://ehlhockey.tv/" target="new">Euro Hockey League media release</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>Vikki Bunce retires from international hockey</strong><br /><br /><img src="http://www.scottish-hockey.org.uk/media/719810/078_500x243.jpg" width="500" height="243" border="0" /><br /><em><strong>Vikki Bunce</strong></em><br /><br />After 206 caps for Scotland and 14 for Great Britain, Vikki Bunce has announced her retirement from International hockey.<br /><br />One of Scotland’s most exciting players since she burst onto the scene, Vikki has played in three Commonwealth Games; played in two World Cups (outdoor 2002 &amp; indoor 2007); won Gold in the 2011 EuroHockey Nations Championship II; won bronze in Champions Challenge I in 2011; and was captain of the women’s national team.<br /><br />The decision to retire has not been an easy one for Bunce and she wrestled with the decision for many months, being extremely proud to have been part of the Scotland team. However, now that the decision has been reached she is grateful to everyone she has played with or been coached by in the past.<br /><br />Bunce said, “There are so many people I’d like to thank. I’ve been playing international hockey since the age of 13 so there have been so many people that have made a significant contribution to my career. I’ve tried to contact many of these people personally but it’s been so hard when you’ve been at it for so long!<br /><br />“Both my clubs, Dundee Wanderers and Bonagrass Grove, have played such an important role in my development. From an early age I was fortunate to play with so many fantastic players, like mixed hockey at Wanderers with the likes of Niall Stott then moving to Grove to play with players like Pauline Stott, Sue Fraser and Ali Ramsay. It was incredible and I learnt so much from just being around them.<br /><br />“The effort from all coaches involved at both clubs made me the player I am today, of that I have no doubt. Laterally the opportunity to coach Dundee Wanderers Ladies team as given me a whole different perspective to hockey, and doing it while playing has been a challenge - but one that I have loved.”<br /><br /><img src="http://www.scottish-hockey.org.uk/media/719815/bunce.jpg" width="500" height="333" border="0" /><br /><em><strong>Vikki Bunce</strong></em><br /><br />Vikki will continue to play club hockey with Dundee Wanderers but ultimately it’s the challenge of balancing international hockey with work, family and club hockey that has led to Bunce’s decision to retire.<br /><br />Since the Europeans last summer she has started a new job with sportscotland institute of sport as East &amp; Central Assistant Regional Performance Manager and it has become a main focus for Vikki.<br /><br />Scotland Senior Women Head Coach Gordon Shepherd paid his own tribute, he said: “Vikki has been an extra special player throughout her career for Scotland. She has been an asset to the senior women’s team, and was exciting to watch on the pitch whether outdoor or indoor. Vikki is without doubt one of the best indoor hockey players Scotland has ever produced. She will be missed by the players, coaches and spectators.”<br /><br />Of her many achievements playing for her country, the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow is a special memory for Bunce. She added: “I’ve had so many great experiences in a Scotland shirt that it’s tough to pin it down to just one. Walking out at the Opening Ceremony at Glasgow was amazing, it still gives me goose bumps thinking about it – the noise was like nothing I had ever experienced and it all completely surpassed what I had imagined. Captaining Scotland in the Indoor programme was also very special to me.”<br /><br />She was involved in the full time GB programme in the lead up to London 2012, the first time she had ever experienced being a full time athlete. Bunce felt that she learnt a lot about herself and hockey during this time. Progressing through age group hockey was also something that Bunce looks back on with fond memories.<br /><br />The journey into senior hockey has been the focal point of her adult life and she has centred everything on the senior programme, from family life to work and everything in between. Bunce continued: “Hockey has defined many of my decisions in life and there have been lots of people involved along the way. My family have supported me through thick and thin - my mum has always been so supportive and never pushy, she’s allowed me to make my own decisions and learn from my own mistakes. To Iain and Oscar who have had to deal with life without me around a lot of the time, a massive thank you for the unconditional love and support. You make it all worthwhile.”<br /><br /><img src="http://www.scottish-hockey.org.uk/media/719820/vikki_500x329.jpg" width="500" height="329" border="0" /><br /><em><strong>Vikki Bunce</strong></em><br /><br /><strong><a href="http://www.scottish-hockey.org.uk/" target="new">Scottish Hockey Union media release</a></strong><br /><br /></p>

Hill Complex at Old Dominion.<br /><br />Delaware (22-2) scored a 3-2 victory over Princeton in Friday’s semifinals to advance, while North Carolina (20-5) needed overtime for a 2-1 victory over Connecticut.<br /><br />Delaware’s victory came in the most exciting match of the afternoon.<br /><br />Esmee Peet, the Blue Hens’ fifth-leading scorer all-time, put her team up 1-0 15 minutes into the first half when she blasted in Maura Zarkoski’s penalty corner set up off Kayla Devlin’s injection pass. But Princeton tied it 51 seconds later when Ryan McCarthy accepted Sophia Tornetta’s pass off a loose ball in the Delaware scoring circle. McCarthy appeared to have given her team a 2-1 advantage with four minutes left, but the goal was reviewed and called too high off the initial strike.<br /><br />Delaware took charge in the second half after coach Rolf van de Kerkhof ordered his team to play more direct. The Blue Hens responded by earning four quick penalty corners. But all four attempts – big hits from the top of the circle by Meghan Winesett – were denied. On a fifth corner, and after some player input to Kerkhof, Delaware tried a “dump left” corner and went up 2-1 on Kiki Bink’s big sweeping shot with 15 minutes left to play.<br /><br />Cat Caro tied it on a penalty corner blast with four minutes left, leaving everyone thinking there would be another overtime. But Peet took a short feed from Winesett on a quick counter with 1:30 left to give Delaware its 18th straight win.<br /><br />North Carolina found itself in a sluggish match with Connecticut (22-2). After a scoreless first half, the Huskies went up 1-0 on Barbara Hoogen’s unassisted shot, only to have the Tar Heels tie it six minutes later when Sam Night deflected Emma Bozek’s slant into the circle.<br /><br />Lauren Moyer finished an overtime that saw North Carolina take total control by sending in a pass from Malin Evert, who had stolen the ball at the 16-yard line.<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://pilotonline.com">The Virginian Pilot </a></strong><br /><br /></p>

Photo by Mark Campbell</strong></em><br /><br />The University of Delaware field hockey team defeated Princeton University 3-2 in an NCAA championship tournament semifinal game played Friday evening at Old Dominion University's L.R. Hill Sports Complex in Norfolk, Virginia.<br /><br />The Blue Hens will face the University of North Carolina at 1 p.m., Sunday, also in Norfolk, for the national championship. It will be UD's first appearance in the national championship game.<br /><br />North Carolina earned its spot in the finale with a 2-1 win in overtime against the University of Connecticut.<br /><br />UD took the early lead 1-0 on a first-half goal by senior Esmee Peete at 15:05 off a penalty corner, with assists by Maura Zarkoski and Kayla Devlin. Princeton tied the score on a goal by Ryan McCarthy less than one minute later. The teams went into the half tied 1-1.<br /><br />The Hens took a 2-1 second half lead on a goal by sophomore Kiki Bink in the 55th minute as the defender redirected the shot from Greta Nauck.<br /><br />Again Princeton came back to tie on a goal by Cat Caro on a penalty corner with a little over three minutes to play.<br /><br />A man down due to a yellow card, UD took the lead for good on a second goal as senior Meghan Winesett sent the ball to a wide open Peet with just a minute and a half left to play.<br /><br />UD junior goalie Emmeline Oltmans had three saves, and Bink was credited with a defensive save. Princeton goalie Grace Baylis had two saves.<br /><br />With the win, UD improves to 22-2. The Hens have won 18 straight games since losing at Princeton on Sept. 11.<br /><br />“This is unreal. To have the opportunity to set and reach our goals is simply amazing," said Peet, a senior tri-captain. "This group is so connected this year. We all want to work for each other and play for each other, so we feel like we can face any opponent at any time. We’ll do anything for this program because we love to play the game and we love to play for each other.”  <br /><br />“It’s just amazing. I can’t really believe it," Nauck said. "To be competing for a championship is just a feeling I can’t really describe. You have to believe in yourself and fight the entire 70 minutes. The game isn’t over until the clock says zero and we fought every minute today. Anything is possible.”<br /><br />“This is what we’ve worked for the entire year," UD head coach Rolf van de Kerkhof said. "We’ve gotten better throughout every game we’ve played. Princeton is a great team with a great tradition of hockey and we had to dig deep to do what we had to do, but we got it done. At the end of the day, there’s only one tournament in the country that you want to be dancing in, and I love 'November Madness' as it relates to field hockey. For us to compete for a NCAA tournament championship, of course it’s exciting, but with this group we celebrate until midnight and then we go back about our business. This group has taken ownership of that approach and they’re level-headed and ready to go.”<br /><br /><a href="http://www.udel.edu/udaily"><strong>UD Daily</strong> </a><br /><br /></p>
