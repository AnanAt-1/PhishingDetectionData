GAME : Greatly Abbreviated Mechanics, Etc.
<p>
Copyright 1992 by E. Chris Garrison (chris@homebrew.net)

<p>
The idea of GAME is to provide an ultra-compact, flexible system that can
be fit onto a single 8.5" x 11" piece of paper, front and back.  GAME
serves only as the barest guideline for roleplaying and leaves all details
to the GM's judgement, and is meant to ease on-the-fly additions.

<p>
A character consists of Attributes, Skills and Abilities.  There are three
Basic Attributes (Strength, Will and Dexterity) with three Calculated
Attributes (Body, Stun, Power) which define a character's natural qualities.
Skills are learned expertise, and are based on one of the Basic Attributes.
Abilities are extra-normal capabilities such as magic, super-powers, cyber-
netic enhancements, mutations, alien powers and so on.  Abilities are modeled 
as Skills with Power levels that reflect the influence the powers have on 
other characters and the game world.  Attributes, Skills and abilities all 
cost points, which are assigned by the GM before a character is created, and 
added as experience is gained.
 
<UL>
<LI> Basic Attributes:  Each is base 0, buying each +1 at 5pts.
	Strength, Will, Dexterity<BR>
<LI> Calculated Attributes:  Body (5 + 2 * Str), Stun (Body + Str + Will),
Power (10 + 2 * (Will or Str))
 
</UL>
Skills:  The cost for a base 10 or less on a 3d6 roll is as follows:<BR>
Combat: 5, Non-Combat: 3, Color: 1

<p>
Where Combat is any skill whose purpose is solely for combat, Non-Combat
is any useful (scientific, professional, language, etc) skill not for combat,
and Color is any background skill that is not likely to actually affect
the game, except as a quirk or curiosity.

<p>
Skill Levels:  Every skill is based on a Basic Attribute, and each +1 is 
bought at the base cost for the skill.  So if a character takes Acrobatics,
the GM could determine that it is a Dex based skill, and if the character
has a 3 Dex, he or she gains that Skill at base 3.  If the character 
spends enough points to gain a +1, the skill is said to be Dex+1, or 4.
So, if the character makes an Acrobatics Skill Roll, he or she would 
add the Skill Level to the 10 base to roll under to succeed.
 
<p>
Skills have a Difficulty Rating (DR) based on:
Simple=0, Easy=-2, Average=-4, Challenging=-6, Difficult=-8, Daunting=-10, 
Near Impossible=-12, Extra Time=+2, Frequent task=+2, ...
 
<p>
Near skills no charge, but follow penalties as follows: Related Skill -2,
Familiar Skill -4, Unfamiliar -6.

<p>
Skill vs. Skill:  If two characters pit their skills against each other,
the "winner" is determined by whoever makes his or her skill roll by
the greatest number.  If any one character fails his or her skill roll,
then the other character is said to have "won".  If both characters
fail, the result is a draw.  (See "Combat" for a practical example).
<p>

Abilities:  As Skills, with added trait of Power Rating (PR), which must be
less than character's Will, using PR Power.  PRs cost N points per 
level, where N is a variable defined by the GM, taking into account such 
things as area of effect, range, interchangeability, and so on.  The GM
does make the PR up arbitrarily, based on how powerful he or she thinks
the ability is, and how much it will affect the game.  Skills are 
zero-power Abilities.  Remember, Skill Rolls must be made for Abilities
like Skills unless a higher cost is assigned in exchange by the GM.  
Examples of Abilities might include Flight, Invisibility, Force Fields 
and the like, things which are beyond normal abilities and skills.
Sample Abilities and Ability Frameworks will appear in GAME supplements.<p>

Combat: Combat is handled like any other skill, though there is no one
"combat" skill.  Any character in a combat-oriented game is assumed
to be able to treat combat as a "Familiar Skill".  Any character who
buys a specific combat skill (Swordsmanship, Laser Gun, Brawling, you 
get the idea...) can treat any other non-purchased combat skill as
a "Related Skill".  

<p>
Combat Skills are applied for attempts to hit another character, and
to avoid being hit.  Unless a special Ability is bought, only one
Combat Skill may be used in a round of combat.  Any character may
attempt to dodge a single attack, but he or she must declare this 
before the attack is rolled, and must forfeit any attacks for that
round.

<p>
A combat round lasts as for an interval of time the GM defines.  The
GM may rule that combat rounds take but a second, or that they last
as long as a minute, the GAME mechanics do not attempt to impose 
realism:  realism is up to the GM to add (or not).  During a combat
round, however, the following things occur:

<UL>
<LI> In descending Dex order, breaking ties with die rolls, attacks are called.
  A character may opt to hold his or her action, but loses it if he or she
  waits past the end of the round.  Abilities being used must be declared
  here, even if in secret to the GM.<BR>
<LI> Characters may dodge one and only one attack instead of attacking.  All 
  others are applied against the character's Dex.  
<LI> Attacks are made.  A hit is scored if a character rolls 10 - the opponent's
  Dex + character's Combat Skill levels or less.  
<LI> Damage is applied.  GMs should define how much damage weapons used in their
  campaign do.  Hit locations are not defined here either, for simplicity,
  though such systems may be used with these rules.  In some games, armor or
  other protection subtracts from damage applied.

</UL>
Disclaimer:  The GAME is obviously only a bare skeleton of mechanics, and leaves
most of the fleshing out to the GM and players.  It is meant to be a tool
to be used for improvisation and impromptu gaming.  More detail may evolve,
but it is not meant to be provided here.<p>

Copying:  These rules may be copied electronically or photostatically freely,
so long as the author is given credit, but may not be sold or used for 
profit by anyone but the author.
