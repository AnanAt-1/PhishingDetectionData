During the summer of 1775 he attempted to raise substantial additional militia forces from the population. These attempts met with limited success, in part because of successful American propaganda and agitation by Patriot sympathizers, especially Thomas Walker, James Price, and James Livingston. By July, Carleton was apparently satisfied with the level of militia support near Montreal, but he did little to stop the activities of the agitators, who also sent reports detailing British military preparations to the Americans.<br />

<H2>Prelude</H2>
When Montgomery finally began the siege of Fort Saint-Jean, he ordered Allen and about 30 Americans to join with Livingston's Canadians to secure the south bank of the St. Lawrence River&nbsp;against attempts by Carleton in Montreal to relieve the siege.  He also ordered a larger force under Brown's command to secure the area north of the fort, and to cover the road between Saint-Jean and Montreal.<br />
<br />
Allen traveled along the southeastern banks of the Richelieu River, up to Sorel, where he crossed that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("34299",this,"longueuil,_quebec.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("34299")' href="/topics/Longueuil,_Quebec">Longueuil</a><span class="hp" id="m34299"><div class="hpHeader">Longueuil, Quebec</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i34299"></div>Longueuil  is a city in the province of Quebec, Canada.

The population as of the Canada 2006 Census totaled 229,330, making it the third largest city in...</div><br></span>. According to Allen's account, he met Brown there, and the two of them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal. Brown would cross the river with 200 men at <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("83670",this,"la_prairie,_quebec.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("83670")' href="/topics/La_Prairie,_Quebec">La Prairie</a><span class="hp" id="m83670"><div class="hpHeader">La Prairie, Quebec</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i83670"></div>La Prairie is an off-island suburb  of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada at the confluence of the Saint-Jacques River and the Saint Lawrence River in the Regional County Municipality of Roussillon...</div><br></span>, upriver from Montreal, and Allen, with his Americans and 80 Canadians under the command of Loiseau and Duggan, two of Livingston's captains, would cross the river at Longueuil, below the city, and the two forces would, after a prearranged signal, converge on the city itself.<br />
<H2>Action</H2>
Allen and his men crossed the St. Lawrence on the night of the 24th, landing at Longue-Pointe. The inhabitants he met there were friendly, but he posted guards on the road to Montreal to prevent news of their crossing from reaching the city. However, one man they detained managed to escape to the city and inform Carleton of Allen's presence on the island.  Brown did not cross the river. While no sources indicate why Brown failed to act, historian Justin Smith suggests that Allen in fact acted alone, and only later sought to blame Brown for the endeavour's failure.  This left Allen's force alone and vulnerable, as it had taken three round trips with the available boats to ferry his men across the river.<br />
<br />
Realizing he would not be able ferry everyone back across the river before troops arrived from the city, Allen chose a wooded area near the Ruisseau-des-Sœurs (labelled on the map above as <i>Ruisseau de la G<sup>de</sup> Prairie</i>), between Longue-Pointe and Montreal, to make a stand.  He also sent word to Thomas Walker, a British merchant and known <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("58356",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("58356")' href="/topics/Patriot_(American_Revolution)">Patriot</a><span class="hp" id="m58356"><div class="hpHeader">Patriot (American Revolution)</div><div class="hpContent">Patriots  is a name often used to describe the colonists of the British Thirteen United Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution.

Walker was able to muster some men, but Allen was captured before they could lend any assistance.<br />
<br />
When General Carleton received word that the notorious Ethan Allen was at the gates of the city, he raised the alarm. As the news spread, large numbers of people turned out. Captain John Campbell assembled a force of 34 regulars from the 26th Foot&nbsp;(the entire garrison in Montreal), 120 Canadien&nbsp;and 80 English militia, 20 British Indian agents, and a few Indians, and led them out to face Allen's force.  As Campbell's force approached, Allen instructed 10 Canadians to cover his left flank, while Duggan and another 50 Canadians were placed on the right flank. Both of these detachments fled instead of holding their positions, leaving Allen with about 50 men.  Over the course of the next 90 minutes, fire was exchanged between the forces. Allen's remaining forces were eventually broken, and, after trying to outrun the enemy, he surrendered.<br />

<H2>Aftermath</H2>
The abortive attack on Montreal led to the full mobilization of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.<br />
<br />
Allen and the other captives were brought to the city. Allen, in his account of the encounter, claims that Colonel Richard Prescott was intent on killing the captured Canadiens, but Allen interceded on their behalf, saying "I am the sole cause of their taking up arms."  Allen was imprisoned in a ship's hold, and eventually sent to England. He spent about a year, mostly on prison ships, before he was released on parole in British-occupied New York City in November 1776, as the British authorities feared hanging him would create a martyr. He was eventually exchanged in May 1778 for <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("30528",this,"archibald_campbell_(british_army_officer).gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("30528")' href="/topics/Archibald_Campbell_(British_Army_officer)">Archibald Campbell</a><span class="hp" id="m30528"><div class="hpHeader">Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i30528"></div>General Sir Archibald Campbell KB  served as Governor of Jamaica and Madras.

<br />
Thomas Walker, the merchant to whom Allen had applied for assistance, was arrested in early October 1775 when twenty regulars and a dozen militia came from Montreal to his house in L'Assomption. Walker's house was destroyed, and he was imprisoned with the intent of sending him to England for trial.  Walker was eventually freed when the Americans captured Montreal and most of the British fleet trying to escape the city.<br />
<H2>Legacy</H2>
Ethan Allen wrote a memoir recounting his version of the circumstances of his capture, and the time of his imprisonment. This work, along with Allen's other memoirs, were quite popular in the 19th century, going through numerous printings.  A city park in the Montreal borough of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, where the action took place, is called <i>Parc de la Capture d'Ethan Allen</i>.
