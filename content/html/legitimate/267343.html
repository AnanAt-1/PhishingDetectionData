<i><font size=-1>Note: In the time since this essay was written, JSP has gone through two
updates and can now be considered better (although yet more complicated) than
it was when this article was written.  However, JSPs competitors have not been
idle and in addition to WebMacro we now have Apache Velocity and my personal
favorite, Tea, from the Walt Disney Internet Group (WDIG).  For an in-depth
discussion of JSP and its competitors, see the 2nd Edition of my book <a
href="../jservlet2">Java Servlet Programming</a>.</font></i>

            <P> By now almost everyone using servlets has heard about JavaServer 
              Pages (JSP), a Sun-invented technology built on top of servlets. 
              Sun has done a marvelous job promoting JSP as a way to get HTML 
              out of servlet code, speeding web application development and improving 
              web page maintenance. In fact, the official "Application Programming 
              Model" document published by Sun has gone so far as to say, "JSP 
              technology should be viewed as the norm while the use of servlets 
              will most likely be the exception." (Section 1.9, December 15, 1999, 
              Draft Release) This paper evaluates whether that claim is valid 
              -- by comparing JSP to another technology built on servlets: template 
              engines. 
            <h3>The Problem with Straight-up Servlets</h3>
            In the beginning, servlets were invented, and the world saw that they 
            were good. Dynamic web pages based on servlets executed quickly, could 
            be moved between servers easily, and integrated well with back-end 
            data sources. Servlets became widely accepted as a premiere platform 
            for server-side web development. 
            <p> However, the commonly-used simple approach to generating HTML 
              content, having the programer write an <tt>out.println()</tt> call 
              per HTML line, became a serious problem for real servlet use. HTML 
              content had to be created within code, an onerous and time consuming 
              task for long HTML pages. In addition, content creators had to ask 
              developers to make all content changes. People searched for a better 
              way. 
            <h3>Along Comes JSP</h3>
            Around this time JSP 0.90 came along. With this new technology you 
            could put snippets of Java code inside your HTML, and the server would 
            automatically create a servlet from the page. This helped quite a 
            lot. There was no attempt to hide the Servlet API; JSP was considered 
            a "cheap" way for a Java programmer to write a servlet. All the HTML 
            code could be included directly without <tt>out.println()</tt> calls 
            and page creators could make changes to the HTML without serious risk 
            of breaking the Java code. 
            <p> But having artists and developers working on the same file wasn't 
              ideal, and having Java inside HTML proved almost as awkward as having 
              HTML inside Java. It could easily create a hard to read mess. 
            <p> So people matured in their use of JSP and started to rely more 
              on JavaBeans. Beans were written to contain business logic code 
              needed by the JSP page. Much of the code inside the JSP page could 
              be moved out of the page into the bean with only minimal hooks left 
              behind where the page would access the bean. 
            <p> More recently, people have started to note that JSP pages used 
              this way are really a "view". They're a component used to display 
              the results of a client request. So people thought, Why submit a 
              request directly to a "view"? What if the targetted "view" isn't 
              the proper view for that request? After all, many requests have 
              several possible resulting views. For example, the same request 
              might generate a success page, a database exception error report, 
              or a required parameter missing error report. The same request might 
              also generate a page in English or a page in Spanish, depending 
              on the client's locale. Why must a client directly submit its request 
              to a view? Shouldn't the client make a request to some general server 
              component and let the server determine the JSP view to return? 
            <p> This belief caused many people to adopt what has been called the 
              "Model 2" design, named after an architecture laid out in the JSP 
              0.92 specification and based on the model-view-controller pattern. 
              With this design, requests are submitted to a servlet "controller" 
              that performs business logic and generates an appropriate data "model" 
              to be displayed. This data is then passed internally to a JSP page 
              "view" for rendering, where it appears to the JSP page like a normal 
              embedded JavaBean. The appropriate JSP page can be selected to do 
              the display, depending on the logic inside the controlling servlet. 
              The JSP page becomes a nice template view. This was another improvement 
              -- and where many serious developers stand today. 
            <h3>Enter Template Engines</h3>
            But why suffer the complexity of JSP just to do templating? Might 
            it not be better to use a dedicated template engine? By using a template 
            engine intended for this exact use instead of the general-purpose 
            JSP, the underlying design can be cleaner, the syntax clearer, the 
            error messages more meaningful, and the tool more customizable. Several 
            companies have built such engines, the most popular probably being 
            WebMacro (<a
href="http://webmacro.org">http://webmacro.org</a>, from Semiotek) whose engine 
            is free. 
            <p> Using a dedicated template engine instead of JSP offers several 
              technical advantages that developers should be aware of: 
            <p> 
            <h3>Problem #1: Java Code Too Tempting</h3>
            JSP makes it tempting to put Java code in the web page, even though 
            that's considered bad design. Just as Java improves on C++ by removing 
            the ability to use global variables and multiple inheritance, so do 
            template engines improve on JSP by removing the ability to put raw 
            code in the page. Template engines enforce good design. 
            <h3>Problem #2: Java Code Required</h3>
            Doing mundane things in JSP can actually demand putting Java code 
            in the page. For example, assume the page needs to determine the context 
            root of the current web application to create a link to the web app 
            home page: 
            <p> In JSP this is best done using Java code: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;a href="&lt;%= request.getContextPath() %&gt;/index.html"&gt;Home page&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
            <p> You can try to avoid Java code using the <tt>&lt;jsp:getProperty&gt;</tt> 
              tag but that leaves you with the following hard-to-read string: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;a href="&lt;jsp:getProperty name="request"
property="contextPath"/&gt;/index.html"&gt;HomePage&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
            <p> Using a template engine there's no Java code and no ugly syntax. 
              Here's the same command written in WebMacro: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;a href="$Request.ContextPath;/index.html"&gt;Home page&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
            <p> In WebMacro, <tt>ContextPath</tt> is seen as a property of the 
              <tt>$Request</tt> variable, accessed using a Perl-like syntax. Other 
              template engines use other syntax styles. 
            <p> An another example where JSP requires Java code in the page, assume 
              an advanced "view" needs to set a cookie to record the user's default 
              color scheme -- a task that presumably should be done by the view 
              and not the servlet controller. In JSP it requires Java code: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;% Cookie c = new Cookie("colorscheme", "blue"); response.addCookie(c); %&gt;
</pre>
            <p> In WebMacro there's no Java code: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
#set $Cookie.colorscheme = "blue"
</pre>
            <p> As a last example, assume it's time to retrieve the color scheme 
              cookie. For the benefit of JSP, we can presume also there's a utility 
              class available to help since doing this raw with <tt>getCookies()</tt> 
              is ridiculously difficult. In JSP: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
&lt;% String colorscheme = ServletUtils.getCookie(request, "colorscheme"); %&gt;
</pre>
            <p> In WebMacro there's no need for a utility class and it's always: 
            <p> 
            <pre>
$Cookie.colorscheme.Value
</pre>
            <p> For graphics artists writing JSP pages, which syntax would be 
              simpler to learn? 
            <p> JSP 1.1 introduced custom tags (allowing arbitrary HTML-like tags 
              to appear in JSP pages executing Java code on the backend) which 
              may help with tasks like this, assuming there becomes a widely known, 
              fully featured, freely available, standardized tag library. So far 
              that has yet to occur. 
            <h3>Problem #3: Simple Tasks are Hard</h3>
            Doing even a simple task such as header and footer includes is overly 
            difficult with JSP. Assume there's a "header" template and a "footer" 
            template to be included on all pages, and each template includes in 
            its content the current page title. 
            <p> In JSP the best way to do this is as follows: 
            <pre>
&lt;% String title = "The Page Title"; %&gt;
&lt;%@ include file="/header.jsp" %&gt;
  Your content here
&lt;%@ include file="/footer.jsp" %&gt;
</pre>
            Page creators must not forget the semi-colon in the first line and 
            must make sure to declare title as a Java String. Plus, the <tt>/header.jsp</tt> 
            and <tt>/footer.jsp</tt> must be made publicly accessible somewhere 
            under the document root even though they aren't full pages themselves. 
            <p> In WebMacro including headers and footers is done easily: 
            <pre>
#set $title = "The Page Title"
#parse "header.wm"
  Your content here
#parse "footer.wm"
</pre>
            There are no semi-colons or String types for designers to remember, 
            and the .wm files are found in a customizable search path, not under 
            the document root. 
            <h3>Problem #4: Lousy Looping</h3>
            Looping is overly difficult in JSP. Here's the JSP code to iterate 
            over a vector of ISP objects printing the name of each. 
            <pre>
&lt;%
  Enumeration e = list.elements();
  while (e.hasMoreElements()) {
    out.print("The next name is ");
    out.println(((ISP)e.nextElement()).getName());
    out.print("&lt;br&gt;");
  }
%&gt;
</pre>
            Someday there will be custom tags for doing these loops. And custom 
            tags for "if" checks too. And JSP pages may look like a grotesque 
            Java reimplemented with tags. But meanwhile, the webmacro loop is 
            already quite nice: 
            <pre>
#foreach $isp in $isps {
  The next name is $isp.Name &lt;br&gt;
}
</pre>
            The <tt>#foreach</tt> directive could be replaced by a custom <tt>#foreach-backwards</tt> 
            directive fairly easily as well if such a thing were necessary. 
            <p> Will custom tags really solve this problem? Probably not. Here's 
              a possible <tt>&lt;foreach&gt;</tt> tag. 
            <pre>
&lt;foreach item="isp" list="isps"&gt;
  The next name is &lt;jsp:getProperty name="isp" property="name"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/foreach&gt;
</pre>
            Which would a graphics artist prefer? 
            <h3>Problem #5: Useless Error Messages</h3>
            JSP page syntax errors can cause surprisingly odd and useless error 
            messages. This is due to the fact the page is transformed into a servlet 
            and then compiled. Good JSP tools can help narrow down errors to likely 
            syntax error locations, but even the best of tools will probably have 
            problems making all error messages meaningful. Some errors will just 
            be impossible for tools to diagnose, due to the transformation. 
            <p> For example, assume a JSP page needs to set a title common across 
              all pages. What's wrong with the following? 
            <pre>
&lt;% static String title = "Global title"; %&gt;
</pre>
            Well, the Tomcat reference implementation for JSP says this is wrong: 
            <pre>
work/%3A8080%2F/JC_0002ejspJC_jsp_1.java:70: Statement expected.
                static int count = 0;
                ^
</pre>
            This cryptic error is trying to say that scriptlets like the above 
            are placed inside the <tt>_jspService()</tt> method and static variables 
            aren't allowed inside methods. The syntax should be <tt>&lt;%! %&gt;</tt>. 
            Page designers won't recognize this error, and programmers likely 
            won't either without looking at the generated source. Even the best 
            tools probably won't be much help with errors such as these. 
            <p> Assuming all the Java code could be moved out of the page, that 
              still doesn't solve this problem. What's wrong with this expression 
              that prints the value of <tt>count</tt>? 
            <pre>
&lt;% count %&gt;
</pre>
            The Tomcat engine says: 
            <pre>
work/8080/_0002ftest_0002ejsptest_jsp_0.java:56: Class count not found in
type declaration.
                 count 
                 ^
work/8080/_0002ftest_0002ejsptest_jsp_0.java:59: Invalid declaration.
                out.write("\r\n");
                         ^
</pre>
            In other words, there's an equal sign missing. It should be <tt>&lt;%= 
            count %&gt;</tt>. 
            <p> Because a template engine can operate directly on the template 
              file without any "magical" translation to code, it's far easier 
              to properly report errors. To use an analogy: When commands are 
              typed into a command line Unix shell written in C, you don't want 
              the shell to create a C program to execute the command. You want 
              the shell to simply interpret the command and behave accordingly, 
              with direct error messages when necessary. 
            <h3>Problem #6: Need a Compiler</h3>
            JSP requires a compiler be shipped with the webserver. That's problematic, 
            especially since Sun doesn't give away the tools.jar library containing 
            their javac compiler. Web servers can package an outside vendor's 
            compiler such as IBM's jikes; however such compilers generally don't 
            work on all platforms and (being written in C++) aren't much help 
            to a pure-Java web server. JSP has a pre-compile option that can help 
            some here, although that's a less than elegant solution. 
            <h3>Problem #7: Wasted Space</h3>
            JSP consumes extra hard drive space and extra memory space. For every 
            30K JSP file on the server there must be a corresponding larger-than-30K 
            class file created. This essentially doubles the hard drive requirements 
            to store JSP pages. Considering how easily a JSP file can <tt>&lt;%@ 
            include&gt;</tt> a large data file for display, this becomes a real 
            concern. Also, each JSP's class file data must be loaded into the 
            server's memory, meaning the server may eventually store the entire 
            JSP document tree in memory. A few JVMs have the ability to remove 
            class file data from memory; however, the programmer generally has 
            no control over the rules for reclaiming and for large sites the reclaiming 
            probably won't be aggressive enough. With template engines there's 
            no need to duplicate the page data into a second file, so hard drive 
            space is spared. Template engines also give the programmer full control 
            over how templates are cached in memory. 
            <p> There are also some downsides to using a template engine: 
            <h3>Template Problem #1: No Specification</h3>
            No specification exists for how a template engine should behave. However, 
            it's interesting to note that this is far less important than with 
            JSP because, unlike JSP, template engines demand nothing special of 
            the web server -- any server supporting servlets supports template 
            engines (including API 2.0 servers like Apache/JServ which can't fully 
            support JSP)! Healthy competition for the best template engine design 
            could actually spark innovation, especially assuming open source implementations 
            that can leverage each other's ideas and code. As it stands now, WebMacro 
            exists like Perl, a tool where the open source implementation is the 
            specification. 
            <h3>Template Problem #2: Not Widely Known</h3>
            Template engines aren't widely known. JSP has had a tremendous amount 
            of marketing and has gained terrific mind share. Using template engines 
            is a relatively unknown alternative technique. 
            <h3>Template Problem #3: Not Yet Tuned</h3>
            Template engines have yet to be highly tuned. No performance numbers 
            have been taken comparing template engine and JSP performance. Theoretically 
            a well tuned implementations of a template engine should match a tuned 
            implementation of JSP; however in the world today, considering the 
            effort third party vendors have given to JSP so far, the odds are 
            good that JSP implementations are better tuned. 
            <h3>The Role of JSP</h3>
            So is there a place for JSP in the future? Certainly. JSP is entirely 
            relevant if what you're trying to do is wean people off of ASP. There's 
            an extremely strong argument for providing something familiar looking 
            in a new environment. This was one of the big motivations behind the 
            creation of JSP, and that shows from the name -- it's no coincidence 
            "JSP" is just one letter off from "ASP". 
            <p> Yet there's a difference between what's suitable to someone who 
              is new to an environment, and what's actually the best way to use 
              that environment. 
            <p> JSP is going to turn out to be one of the most important Java 
              technologies for convincing people to leave the ASP world in favor 
              of Java -- and hence there's a strong business case for Sun supporting 
              it, and for any Java booster to support it. 
            <p> However, that doesn't make it the best solution for the Java platform. 
              That makes it the Java solution that is most like the non-Java solution.
