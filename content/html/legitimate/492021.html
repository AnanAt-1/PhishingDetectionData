While most bands undergo a number of changes over the course of their career, few groups experienced such radical stylistic changes as Fleetwood Mac. Initially conceived as a hard-edged British Blues combo in the late '60s, the band gradually evolved into a polished Pop/Rock act over the course of a decade. Throughout all of their incarnations, the only consistent members of Fleetwood Mac were drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, the rhythm section who provided the band with its name. 
<p>
The roots of Fleetwood Mac lie in John Mayall's legendary British Blues outfit, The Bluesbreakers. John McVie (bass) was one of the charter members of The Bluesbreakers, joining the group in 1963. In 1966 Peter Green replaced Eric Clapton and a year later, Mick Fleetwood (drums) joined. Inspired by the success of Cream, The Yardbirds and Jimi Hendrix, the trio decided to break away from Mayall in 1967. At their debut at the British Jazz And Blues Festival that August, Bob Brunning was playing bass in the group, since McVie was still under contract to Mayall. He joined the band a few weeks after their debut. By that time, slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer had joined the band. Fleetwood Mac soon signed with Blue Horizon, releasing their eponymous debut the following year. "Fleetwood Mac" was an enormous hit in the UK, spending over a year in the Top 10. Despite its British success, the album was virtually ignored in America. During 1968, the band added guitarist Danny Kirwan. The following year, they recorded in Chicago with a variety of bluesmen, including Willie Dixon and Otis Spann. The set was released later that year, after the band had left Blue Horizon for a one-album deal with Immediate Records. In the US, they signed with Reprise/Warner Brothers and by 1970, Warner began releasing the band's British records as well. 
<p>
Fleetwood Mac released "English Rose" and "Then Play On" during 1969, which both indicated that the band members were expanding their music, moving away from their Blues-purists roots. That year, Green's "Man of the World" and "Oh Well" were number two hits. Though his music was providing the backbone of the group, Peter Green was growing increasingly disturbed due to his alleged large ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs. After announcing that he was planning to give all of his earnings away, Green suddenly left the band in the Spring of 1970. He released two solo albums over the course of the '70s, but he rarely performed after leaving Fleetwood Mac. The band replaced him with Christine Perfect, a vocalist/pianist who had earned a small but loyal following in the UK by singing with Spencer Davis and the Chicken Shack. She had already performed unaccredited on "Then Play On". Contractual difficulties prevented her from becoming a full-fledged member of Fleetwood Mac until 1971. By that time she had married John McVie. 
<p>
Christine McVie didn't appear on 1970's "Kiln House", the first album the band recorded without Peter Green. For that LP Jeremy Spencer dominated the band's musical direction, but he had also been having problems due to alleged drug use. During the band's American tour in early 1971, Spencer disappeared. It was later discovered that he left the band to join the religious cult, the Children of God. Fleetwood Mac had already been trying to determine the direction of their music, but Spencer's departure sent the band into disarray. Christine McVie and Danny Kirwan began to move the band towards Mainstream Rock on 1971's "Future Games", but new guitarist Bob Welch exerted a heavy influence on 1972's "Bare Trees". Kirwan was fired after "Bare Trees" and was replaced by guitarists Bob Weston and Dave Walker, who appeared on 1973's "Penguin". Walker left after that album, and Weston departed after making its follow-up, "Mystery to Me" (1973).
<p>
 In 1974, the group's manager Clifford Davis formed a bogus Fleetwood Mac, and had the band tour the US. The real Fleetwood Mac filed and won a lawsuit against the impostors, who, after losing, began performing under the name Stretch, but the lawsuit kept the real band off the road for most of the year. In the interim, they released "Heroes Are Hard To Find". Late in 1974, Fleetwood Mac moved to California with hopes of re-starting their career. Welch left the band shortly after the move to form a group called Paris and later enjoyed solo hits with "Sentimental Lady" (#8 in 1988), "Ebony Eyes" (#14 in 1978), "Hot Love, Cold World" (#31 in 1978) and "Precious Love" (#18 in 1979).
<p>
Early in 1975, Fleetwood and McVie were auditioning engineers for the band's new album when they heard "Buckingham-Nicks", an album recorded by the Soft-Rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The two were asked to join the group and their addition revived the band's musical and commercial fortunes. Not only did the pair write songs, but they brought the distinctive talents the band had been lacking. Buckingham was skilled Pop craftsman, capable of arranging a commercial song while keeping it musically adventurous. Nicks had a husky voice and a sexy, hippie gypsy stage persona which gave the band a charismatic front woman. The new line-up of Fleetwood Mac released their eponymous debut in 1975 and it slowly became a huge hit, reaching number one in 1976 on the strength of the singles "Over My Head" (#20 in 1975), "Rhiannon" (#11 in 1976) and "Say You Love Me" (#11 in 1976). The album would eventually sell over five million copies in the US alone.
<p> 
While Fleetwood Mac had finally attained their long-desired commercial success, the band was fraying apart behind the scenes. The McVies divorced in 1976, and Buckingham and Nicks' romance ended shortly afterward. The internal tensions formed the basis for the songs on their next album, "Rumours. Released in the Spring of 1977, "Rumours" became a blockbuster success, topping the American and British charts and generating the hit singles "Go Your Own Way" (#10) "Dreams" (#1), "Don't Stop" (#3) and "You Make Loving Fun" (#9), all in 1977. It would eventually sell over 17 million copies in the US alone, making it the second biggest-selling album of all-time. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with an exhaustive, lucrative tour and then retired to the studio to record their follow-up to "Rumours". A wildly experimental double-album conceived largely by Buckingham, "Tusk" (1979) didn't duplicate the enormous success of "Rumours", yet it did go multi-Platinum and featured the singles "Tusk" (#8)  and "Sara" (#7).
<p>
In 1980, they released the double-album, "Live". Following the Tusk tour, Fleetwood, Buckingham and Nicks all recorded solo albums. Of the solo projects, Stevie Nicks' "Bella Donna" (1981) was the most successful, peaking at number one and featuring the hit singles "Stop Draggin' My Heart Around" (#3 in 1981) "Leather and Lace" (#6 in 1981), with The Eagles' Don Henley) and "Edge of Seventeen" (#11 in 1982). Buckingham's "Law and Order" (1981) was a moderate success, spawning the #9 hit, "Trouble". Fleetwood, for his part, made a world music album called "The Visitor". Fleetwood Mac reconvened in 1982 for "Mirage". More conventional and accessible than "Tusk", "Mirage" reached number one and featured the 1982 hit singles "Hold Me" (#4) and "Gypsy" (#12). 
<p>
After "Mirage", Buckingham, Nicks and Christine McVie all worked on solo albums. The hiatus was due to a variety of reasons. Each member had their own manager, Nicks was becoming the group's breakaway star, Buckingham was obsessive in the studio and each member was allegedly suffering from various substance addictions. Nicks was able to maintain her popularity with  the albums "The Wild Heart" (1983) and "Rock A Little" (1985), both of which reached the Top 15. Christine McVie also had a Top 10 hit with "Got A Hold On Me" in 1984. Buckingham received the strongest reviews of all, but his 1984 album "Go Insane" failed to generate a hit single. Fleetwood Mac reunited to record a new album in 1985. Buckingham, who had grown increasingly frustrated with the musical limitations of the band, decided to make it his last project with the band. When the resulting album, "Tango In The Night", was finally released in 1987, it was greeted with mixed reviews but strong sales, reaching the Top 10 and generating the Top 20 hits "Little Lies" (#4) and "Everywhere" (#14).
<p> 
Buckingham decided to leave Fleetwood Mac after completing "Tango In The Night" and the group replaced him with guitarists Billy Burnette and Rick Vito. The new line-up of the band recorded their first album, "Behind the Mask", in 1990. It became the band's first album since 1975 to not go Gold. Following a supporting tour, Nicks and Christine McVie announced they would continue to record with the group, but not tour. Vito left the band in 1991, and the group released the box set "25 Years -- The Chain" the following year.
<p>
The classic Fleetwood Mac line-up of Fleetwood, the McVies, Buckingham and Nicks reunited to play President Bill Clinton's inauguration in early 1993, but the concert did not lead to a full-fledged reunion. Later that year, Nicks left the band and was replaced by Bekka Bramlett and Dave Mason. Christine McVie left the group shortly afterward. The new line-up of Fleetwood Mac began touring in 1994, releasing "Time" the following year to little attention. 
<p>
While the new version of Fleetwood Mac wasn't commercially successful, neither were the solo careers of Buckingham, Nicks and McVie, prompting speculation of a full-fledged reunion in 1997. The live album "Shrine 69" was released in 1999, but no reunion took place. The Fleetwood Mac saga continued with the Reprise Records release of "The Dance", a new Fleetwood Mac album that gave fresh meaning to the term "long-awaited." Recorded live for an MTV special, "The Dance" highlights new renditions of thirteen Mac classics, from "Dreams" to "Rhiannon", "Don't Stop" to "Tusk", as well as the such key tracks as "The Chain" and "Silver Springs". Proving the Mac magic was as potent as ever, "The Dance", produced by Lindsey Buckingham and Elliot Schiener, also featured four new songs, including the Christine McVie composition "Temporary One", "Sweet Girl" by Stevie Nicks and two new Buckingham tracks, "Bleed To Love Her" and "My Little Demon". Catapulting straight from the studio to the stage, Fleetwood Mac embarked on an extensive U.S. tour that Fall, bringing the Mac magic to audiences coast to coast. "My only condition for coming back together was that we could have some fun," said  Christine. "The rehearsals proved that we could, and that we were tighter and better than we'd ever been. It was tremendously gratifying." "I think a lot of the creativity we were feeling had come from the healing we'd all experienced," said Stevie Nicks. "We were friends who had been away for a long time and this reunion was not just musical, it was personal." Questions of repertoire were resolved almost before they came up. "Naturally we did the material we were familiar with," explained John. "It was like our fingers were just flying to the notes. We worked up some new arrangements, but we also wanted to try out some fresh stuff. Luckily, we had no shortage of new material to try." Christine added, "Each one of us brought in a new song and hearing them played by this particular combination of musicians is like no other experience I know. We understand each other, where to go, and how to get there even before it's spoken." What was also left almost unspoken was the fact that, from various paths both personal and professional, Fleetwood Mac had at last found themselves together again. "Of course there's a business aspect to all this," says Mick, "but anyone who's been around this process can tell you that it really is the music that's brought us back." "I care about these people," is how Lindsey puts it. "And I enjoy being around them, now more than ever. Fleetwood Mac is a complicated scheme, a careful balancing act and when we get it right, there's nothing quite like it." "Even after we decided to formalize what we'd been doing as 'a reunion,'" added John, "there was still an attitude of taking things one day at a time. Today is wonderful. Tomorrow will take care of itself."  
<p>
The band, (minus Christine McVie) played at a farewell party for President Clinton on the south lawn of the White House, on January 6, 2001. The group played "Don't Stop" (Thinking About Tomorrow), the theme of Clinton's campaigns. Said Lindsey Buckingham, "We were there to usher in his administration, and it was an emotional experience to help see it off". Buckingham said that McVie had moved back to her native England and therefore did not attend. "This is all very exciting, but at the same time very familiar," mused Stevie Nicks. "When we get together something amazing happens. It takes on a life of its own." McVie's departure left Nicks and Buckingham to sing lead vocals for the band's 2003 album, "Say You Will", although Christine did contribute some background vocals and keyboards. The LP debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 chart and produced the singles, "Peacekeeper" and the title track. The recording was supported by a world tour which lasted through 2004. In September, 2004, Christine McVie released her first solo album in nearly twenty years. "In The Meantime" was recorded at a studio at her home in Kent, England, along with her nephew Dan Perfect, former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Billy Burnette and drummer Steve Ferrone of The Average White Band.
<p>
Solo projects kept Fleetwood Mac apart for the next five years. Rumors that Sheryl Crow would take Christine's place were proven untrue and the band reformed without either of them on March 1st, 2009 for a brief U.S. tour. In October of that year, the band began a series of shows in Europe which lasted into early November, followed by a tour of Australia and New Zealand in December. That same Autumn, "The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac" was re-released in an extended two-disc format, premiering at #6 on the UK album chart. The band appeared infrequently in 2010, but in May, 2011, an episode of the TV show <i>Glee</i> featured six songs from the "Rumours" album, sparking new interest in Fleetwood Mac's music. Amazingly, that 1977 LP re-entered the Billboard 200 chart at #11, the same week that Stevie Nicks' new solo album "In Your Dreams" debuted at #6.
<p>
Original Fleetwood Mac bassist Bob Brunning died on October 18th, 2011, at the age of 68. On May 13th, 2011, Stevie Nicks announced that Fleetwood Mac would go out on tour again in 2012, but there was no mention of a new album. Former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Bob Weston was found dead on January 3rd, 2012, at the age of 64. Former guitarist Bob Welch committed suicide on June 7th, 2012. He was 66.
<p>
The news that fans had been hoping for finally came in early December of 2012 when Stevie Nicks told <i>Billboard</i> that the band had recorded three new songs that would be released before they hit the road again on April 4, 2013. The songs, which would be issued as digital downloads, were recorded in November at Lindsay Buckingham's home studio while the group was gathered to discuss its tour plans. In September of that year, more exciting news came when Nicks announced that Christine McVie was slated to re-join the group for one song only at two shows on their forthcoming European tour, scheduled to kick off on September 20th. Sadly, after completing the Euopean leg of the tour, bassist John McVie was diagnosed with cancer and fourteen dates in Australia and New Zealand were canceled so that he could undergo treatment. The bassist was well enough to appear with his Fleetwood Mac band mates for their New Year's shows in Las Vegas. <i>Billboard Boxscore</i> reported that the group's 2013 tour was the 17th most profitable of the year, grossing $62 million from forty-five shows.
<p>
In mid-January, 2014, the band's publicist confirmed that Christine McVie had rejoined the band after departing the group in 1998. She wrote some of the act's biggest Billboard Hot 100 chart hits, including "Say You Love Me" (#11 in 1976), "Don't Stop" (#3 in 1977), "You Make Loving Fun" (#9 in 1977), "Hold Me" (#4 in 1982), "Little Lies" (#4 1987) and "Everywhere" (#14 1988). McVie was slated to be with the band for their thirty-four show Fall 2014 tour, which kicked off in Minneapolis on September 30th and wound up in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida on December 19th. In July, Stevie Nicks revealed that she would be joining the TV talent show <i>The Voice</i> as an advisor for the upcoming season. She also announced her new CD, "24 Karat Gold: Songs From the Vault", would be released on October 7th. 
<p>
In June, 2015, Mick Fleetwood told the UK newspaper <i>The Mirror</i> that he'd love to make another album because the band has a "shit load of new songs." Stevie Nicks on the other hand said that the group's current tour is so exhausting that she just couldn't think about new material at the moment. For 2016, the only show on the band's schedule was a July 28th appearance at the Los Angeles Dodgers second annual Blue Diamond Gala, where the band's classic lineup of Christine McVie , Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie were slated to appear. In January, 2017, Christine McVie told <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine that the band was planning on releasing a new album later in the year that would include songs already in the bank and some that they planned to record next October. She also confirmed that she and Lindsey Buckingham were  working on a duet album together that they'll release under the moniker Buckingham / McVie. In March of that same year, Stevie Nicks told <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine that she didn't think that Fleetwood Mac would ever record another album of new material, saying that it was too expensive to make a new recording that, in her words, "Isn't going to sell." 
<p>
In January, 2018, the members of the band received MusiCares annual Person Of The Year Award at New York's Radio City Music Hall. MusiCares is a non-profit health care organization, established by The Recording Academy, to provide health and medical assistance to needy musicians. In early April, their 1977 single "Dreams" shot to #16 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart thanks to a viral tweet that claimed, "Fleetwood Mac's music is so boring, you can't even dance to it." After being retweeted over 130,000 times, the posting was thought to be the reason that "Rumours" went from #21 to #13 on the Top Rock Albums chart.
<p>
April 9th of that same year brought the somewhat surprising announcement that the rest of Fleetwood Mac had fired guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and replaced him with Mike Campbell of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers and Neil Finn of Crowded House. The decision was reached after a disagreement over the band's upcoming tour. The group issued a statement that read in part,  "With Mike and Neil, we'll be performing all the hits that the fans love, plus we'll be surprising our audiences with some tracks from our historic catalogue of songs. Fleetwood Mac has always been a creative evolution. We look forward to honoring that spirit on this upcoming tour." A disappointed Lindsey Buckingham responded by saying, "I think what you would say is that there were factions within the band that had lost their perspective. The point is that they'd lost their perspective. What that did was to harm, and this is the only thing I'm really sad about, the rest of it becomes an opportunity, it harmed the forty-three year legacy that we had worked so hard to build, and that legacy was really about rising above difficulties in order to fulfill one's higher truth and one's higher destiny."
<p>
On June 8, 2018, Mick Fleetwood announced the passing of the band's former guitarist, Danny Kirwan. Paying tribute to the 68-year-old musician, Mick Fleetwood said that Kirwan's legacy "Will forever live on in the music he wrote and played so beautifully as a part of the foundation of Fleetwood Mac." The only good news that month came when the band's "Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac" surpassed the two million mark. The album had peaked at #12 on the Billboard chart in 2002. Mid-November brought yet another re-hash in the form of a fifty-song, triple CD and five LP collection called "50 Years – Don't Stop". The set covers all of the incarnations of Fleetwood Mac, from the band's earliest days with Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan, through the Bob Welch period, into the classic ’70s line-up with Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. By January, 2019 faithful fans had gobbled up enough copies to push it to #4 on the Billboard 200 chart.
<p>
As he continued to focus on his solo tour, Lindsey Buckingham responded to a fan's question on Twitter that asked if he missed being in the band: "I can't say that I 'miss' being in Fleetwood Mac, as I've been concentrating on fulfilling my own plans that were already in the works before the split happened. So, in a sense, the situation is still too new to miss, especially since I don't have much regard for the way the band is presenting itself now." He confirmed that, as of January, 2019, the only one of his former mates that he had heard from was Christine McVie. "Christine said she missed me very much, that FM wasn't complete without me," Buckingham wrote. "[She] said she felt that Stevie was very likely regretting having given the rest of the band the ultimatum that forced my departure. Perhaps wishful thinking on Christine's part. In any case, it was great to hear from her, and I do hope we work together again down the line." Unfortunately, Buckingham's plans were interrupted when he was forced to have emergency open heart surgery in early February, 2019. Although the operation was successful, his vocal chords were damaged by the operation. His former band mates responded with kindness when they tweeted, "We are saddened by this news. Our thoughts and love go out to Lindsey and his entire family. We are hopeful for his speedy recovery."
<p>
A brighter day came on March 29th, 2019 when Stevie Nicks was inducted into Cleveland's Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame as a solo artist. She became the first woman to have been honored twice by the Rock Hall for the different stages of their career. During the evening Don Henley joined her to sing "Leather and Lace", while Harry Styles filled in for the late Tom Petty on "Stop Draggin' My Heart Around".
<p>
In mid-November, 2019, Mick Fleetwood announced that he would host a concert honoring the early years of Fleetwood Mac and its co-founder Peter Green on February 25th, 2020 at the London Palladium. Other acts scheduled to join him included Billy Gibbons, David Gilmour, Jonny Lang, John Mayall, Christine McVie, Zak Starkey, Steven Tyler and Bill Wyman. December of that same year brought good news from Lindsey Buckingham when he announced that he had recovered from his surgery and would resume performing on May 1st when he was slated to appear at the Beale Street Music Festival, in Memphis' Tom Lee Park. He later added twelve more shows that were set to run from April 25th at the Smith Center in Las Vegas and wrap up May 13th at the Magnolia Performing Arts Center in El Cajon, California. As with most touring acts, those plans were scuttled by the COVID-19 outbreak.
<p>
Some sad news came on July 25th, 2020 when it was learned that founding guitarist Peter Green had died in his sleep at the age of 73. Ironically, that announcement came just after the band had revealed plans to release a massive box set documenting their early years, on September 4th. Titled "Fleetwood Mac 1969-1974", the collection is made up of eight CDs, beginning with their third album, 1969's "Then Play On". Also included are  the studio albums "Kiln House" (1970), "Future Games" (1971), "Bare Trees" (1972), "Penguin" (1973), "Mystery to Me" (1973) and "Heroes Are Hard to Find" (1974) — all with bonus tracks. The eighth CD, "Live From the Record Plant 12-15-74", was recorded shortly before Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the band.
<p>
In mid-September, Stevie Nicks announced that a special concert film called <i>Stevie Nicks 24 Karat Gold the Concert</i>, would screen in theaters on October 21 and 25 at select cinemas, drive-ins and exhibition spaces around the world. A month later, Fleetwood Mac found themselves back in the Top 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time since Ronald Reagan was President. Thanks to a viral TikTok video, the band's only chart topper, "Dreams" climbed to #21. As for Lindsey Buckingham, he kept busy by planning a home studio concert scheduled to go online December 5th.
<p>
In a BBC Radio 2 interview in early 2021, a now 77-year-old Christine McVie said she felt she was "too old" to tour with Fleetwood Mac again. She also expressed doubt that Stevie Nicks and John McVie would be interested in taking part in any post-coronavirus road trip, although she was sure drummer Mick Fleetwood would. She added, "We're certainly not touring this year either." In a February, 2021 interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i>, Mick did indeed say that he would like to go out one last time to say goodbye to the fans. He also revealed that he was back on speaking terms with Lindsey Buckingham and that he would love to make music with him again, either with Fleedwood Mac or outside of the band. Meanwhile, Buckingham announced a new, self-titled, solo album, his first since 2011's "Seeds We Sow", would be released on September, 17th. The lead single, "I Don't Mind", was issued on June 8th. In an odd twist of fate, on the exact same day that Buckingham announced his new album, <i>TMZ</i> reported that his wife of more than twenty years, Kristen Messner, had filed for divorce. As August drew to a close, Lindsay announced his first ever solo tour of Europe would kick off on May 17th, 2022. That was to be followed by a trek through the southern U.S. starting October 26th.
<p>
As for Stevie Nicks, she had planned a series of shows in Colorado, California and Texas in the closing months of 2021, but canceled all of them due to a rise in COVID-19 cases in America. The 73-year-old vocalist was quoted as saying, "My primary goal is to keep healthy so I can continue singing for the next decade or longer." 
<p>
To fill the void left by COVID-19, Mick Fleetwood was slated to serve as executive producer for a music drama TV series called <i>13 Songs</i>. The story follows a fictional Rock legend named Jasper Jones who is given just months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a love letter to his fans, Jones reconnects with his band, The Grift, to write and record thirteen final songs and leave a lasting mark on the world.
<p>
Christine McVie kept busy by working on a solo album called "Songbird" that contains new arrangements of some of her biggest hits. The LP was scheduled for release in June, 2022. Lindsey Buckingham was in the midst of a European tour in early September, 2022 when he abruptly canceled all the remaining dates due to continued health issues. His team did not disclose the details of his current health concerns.
<p>
Fans were shocked and saddened to learn that Christine McVie had passed away on November 30th, 2022 after suffering a massive stroke brought on by an aggressive form of cancer. She was 79. The band confirmed her death with a note shared on social media that said, "There are no words to describe our sadness at the passing of Christine McVie. She was truly one-of-a-kind, special and talented beyond measure. She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life. We were so lucky to have a life with her. Individually and together, we cherished Christine deeply and are thankful for the amazing memories we have. She will be so very missed." Predictably, sales of Fleetwood Mac's album "Rumours" saw a 200% jump in sales following McVie's death. 
<p>
For the new year, Lindsey Buckingham took to social media and expressed his sorrow over the loss of Christine McVie. He also noted that his health had improved to the point where he was looking forward to working on a new album. As for the rest of Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood told an <i>L.A. Times</i> reporter at the Grammy Awards on January 5th, 2023, "I think right now, I truly think the line in the sand has been drawn with the loss of Chris. I'd say we're done, but then we've all said that before. It's sort of unthinkable right now."
<p>
With no new music in sight, a July 28th, 2023 date was set for the release of a Stevie Nicks' career spanning, 10-CD collection called "Complete Studio Albums & Rarities". That assemblage would set consumers back $100, or they could opt for the 16-LP crystal-clear vinyl version for $300.
<p>
The following August brought tough times for Mick Fleetwood, as he lost his restaurant in the Maui fire disaster. The drummer took to Instagram to say "Maui and The Lahaina community have been my home for several decades. This is a devastating moment for Maui and many are suffering unimaginable loss. Fleetwood's on Front Street has been lost and while we are heartbroken our main priority is the safety of our dear staff and team members."
<p> 
As a testament to Fleetwood Mac's continuing popularity, the UK Official Charts Company announced in October, 2023, that the band's albums "50 Years – Don't Stop" sat at #6 and "Rumours" was at #23. 
<p>
Stevie Nicks planned about two dozen shows across America in 2024. Meanwhile, Lindsey Buckingham announced a new 4LP and 4CD collection of his solo material called "20th Century Lindsey" would be released in August. A compilation album titled "Best Of Fleetwood Mac (1969-1974)" was slated for release on CD and 2LP on July 26th, 2022. Rhino Records also got into the act when they revealed that a three-LP, two-CD collection titled "Mirage Tour '82 would be available starting September 20th. That set consists of live recordings from Fleetwood Mac's two sold-out shows at The Forum in 1982.

In late September, 2024, Stevie Nicks released a new single titled "The Lighthouse", which she was inspired to write because of the overturning of Roe Vs Wade. "I have often said to myself, this may be the most important thing I ever do. To stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters, and the men that love them. This is an anthem." Her upcoming tour schedule included appearing on NBC's <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and select dates in Pennsylvania and Detroit.

In January, 2025, Rhino.com announced that five Fleetwood Mac albums, "Fleetwood Mac" (1975), "Rumours" (1977), "Tusk" (1979), "Mirage" (1982), and "Tango In The Night" (1987) would be re-released as a 6 LP, crystal-clear vinyl, boxed set or 5 CD set on March 28th. As good as that was, even better news came in late March when Mick Fleetwood revealed that he and Lindsey Buckingham had reunited in the studio for his new solo album.

At her induction into the Pollstar Hall of Fame on April 16th, 2025, Stevie Nicks revealed that she was working on her first new solo album in fourteen years. The 76-year-old singer had been biding her time until a run of summer and fall shows were to kick off on August 12th in Boston before wrapping up in Oklahoma City on October 15th.
