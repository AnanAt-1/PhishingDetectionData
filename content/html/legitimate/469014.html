PUBLISHERS'  NOTICE. 


The  Subscribers,  in  offering  to  the  public  this  work, 
would  recommend  it  to  their  patronage  from  its  intrinsic 
value  as  a  complete  guide  for  strangers  and  others  to  all 
places  of  interest  and  attraction  in  the  city,  as  well  as 
an  advertising  medium  of  rare  advantage — the  benefits 
of  which  are  incalculable,  except  to  those  who  have  paid 
attention  to  the  " Philosophy  of  Advertising,"  and  found 
the  rich  harvest  gathered  from  the  many  seeds  sown  in 
this  way  ;  while  others,  from  being  "  penny  wise  and 
pound  foolish,"  have  found,  alas,  when  too  late,  the 
fatal  error  they  have  fallen  into  by  saying  that  "no- 
body reads  advertisements."  This  remark  may  apply 
to  some  works,  but  certainly  not  to  this,  in  which  the 
attractive  qualities  of  their  offices  and  merchandise  are 
served  up  in  so  peculiar  and  inviting  a  form. 


iv  publishers'    notice. 


This  work  will  be  published  annually,  with  additions 
and  improvements,  embracing  descriptions  of  private  I 
mansions,  country-seats,  &amp;c,  &amp;c,  in  the  vicinity  of 
Philadelphia,  with  an  account  of  the  principal  events 
of  the  previous  year,  making  it  in  fact  "Philadelphia 
AS  it  is,"  in  each  and  every  year.

A    WORD    TO    THE    READER. 

Some  may  think  it  unnecessary  to  make  any  prefatory  re- 
marks, by  way  of  introduction,  to  a  work  of  this  character  ;  but 
when  the  number  of  "  Hand-books/'  "  Guides/'  &amp;c,  already  pub- 
lished, is  considered,  we  may  surely  be  justified  in  giving  the 
"  wherefore"  which  has  induced  us  to  add  another  to  the  cata- 
logue, and  thus  make  good  our  claim  for  a  share  of  the  public 
patronage  and  support,  which  we  venture  to  believe  ourselves 
entitled  to. 

To  the  descriptions  of  Philadelphia  and  its  vicinity,  which 
have  already  been  published,  it  has  been  justly  objected  that 
they  contain  mere  descriptions  of  buildings,  &amp;c.,  which,  how- 
ever correctly  written,  necessarily  fail  to  'arrest  the  attention, 
or  impart  that  information  and  instruction,  which  books  of 
this  character  are  expected  to  afford.  To  remedy  these  and 
similar  objections,  the  present  work  has  been  compiled,  which, 
while  it  claims  to  be  equal  to  any  of  its  predecessors  in  general 
information,  will,  we  hope,  be  considered  superior,  on  account 
of  its  illustrations  and  descriptive  detail.  The  map  and  en- 
gravings have  been  executed  with  great  care.  The  illustra- 
tions comprehend  some  of  the  most  interesting  views  and  ob- 
jects in  this  city  and  its  vicinity.  If  the  work  meet  the 
requirements  of  the  public,  our  object  will  be  attained.

14  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 


A    TALK   ABOUT    THE    PAST   AND   THE    PRESENT 
HISTORY   OF   THE    CITY. 

One  hundred  and  seventy-one  years  ago,  the  site  of  Phila- 
delphia was  a  wilderness.  Our  beautiful  streets,  now  alive 
with  the  ceaseless  hum  of  industry  and  the  turmoil  of  com- 
merce, was  the  hunting-ground  of  the  Indian.  Behold  the 
change ! 

In  the  year  1681,  the  first  settlers  arrived  from  London,  in 
the  ship  "  Sarah  and  John,"  Captain  Smith.  The  following 
year,  William  Penn,  its  great  proprietor  and  founder,  landed 
at  the  "  Blue  Anchor,"  near  the  mouth  of  Dock  Creek. 

The  object  this  celebrated  man  had  in  establishing  "  the 
new  Colony"  was,  using  his  own  words,  "  to  afford  an  asylum 
to  the  good  and  oppressed  of  all  nations,  to  frame  a  govern- 
ment which  might  be  an  example,  to  show  men  as  free  and  as 
happy  as  they  could  be."  "I  am,"  he  writes,  " spending  my 
life  and  my  money  without  being  a  sixpence  enriched  by  my 
greatness.  Had  I  sought  greatness  only,  I  had  stayed  at  home, 
where  the  difference  between  what  I  am,  and  was  offered  and 
could  have  been  there,  in  power  and  wealth,  is  as  wide  as  the 
places  are  apart." 

Everything  connected  with  the  settlement  and  early  history 
of  Philadelphia,  indicates  the  enlarged  and  religious  mind  of 
this  Pater  Patriae.  The  very  name  he  chose  is  impressive,  as 
importing  in  its  original  Greek  sense — "  brotherly  love."  The 
plan  and  limits  were  on  the  most  magnificent  scale.  Had  those 
original  plans  been  carried  out,  Philadelphia  would  now  have 
been  the  most  splendid  city  in  the  world.  They  were  feared, 
however,  to  be  too  extensive,  and  the  contemplated  city  was 
reduced  to  one-fourth  of  the  original  plan. 

The  first  house  erected  was  the   "Blue  Anchor"  tavern, 


THE  PAST  AND  THE  PRESENT.  15 

situated  near  the  mouth  of  Dock  Creek,  on  the  spot  which  is 
now  the  northwest  corner  of  Dock  and  Front  Streets.  In  1684, 
the  population  was  2500  inhabitants.  In  the  year  1701,  Phila- 
delphia was  incorporated  into  a  city.  It  increased  rapidly  at 
that  early  day.  In  1739,  a  resident  writes,  that  it  was  the 
admiration  of  all  people  who  saw  or  heard  of  its  flourishing 
condition  in  lands,  in  building  houses,  and  shipping,  in  manu- 
factures, and  increase  of  population. 

At  present,  Philadelphia  extends  from  Southwark  to  Rich- 
mond, a  distance  of  nearly  five  miles ;  and  from  the  Delaware 
to  the  Schuylkill.  Innumerable  steamboats,  sailboats,  &amp;c, 
travel  along  her  shores — merchantmen  and  packets  bring  her 
the  wealth  of  the  most  distant  climes.  Still  her  progress  is  on- 
ward. 

The  enterprise  of  her  citizens  was  never  more  displayed 
than  at  present.  Railroads  and  canals  pour  into  her  lap  the 
treasures  alike  of  our  own  mountains  and  the  great  valley  of 
the  glorious  West.  The  city  is  extending  with  wondrous 
strides ;  year  by  year  streets  are  being  laid  out,  and  houses, 
extending  away  for  squares,  arise,  as  by  the  hand  of  magic,  on 
ground  that  lately  "  waved  in  golden  harvest."  Spring  Garden 
and  Penn,  twelve  years  ago,  were  rural  districts.  Now  look 
at  them  !  We  remember  rambling,  five  years  since,  through 
fields  immediately  north  of  Poplar  Street,  where  are  now 
beautiful  streets,  adorned  with  tasty,  and,  in  many  instances, 
magnificent  houses.  In  the  "  west  end,"  the  change  is  no  less 
extraordinary.  Who  does  not  remember  the  "duck  ponds" 
and  " commons  out  Broad  Street?"  They  are  gone,  and 
houses  unrivalled,  in  any  city,  for  architectural  taste  and  ele- 
gance, now  line  Vine,  Race,  Arch,  Chestnut,  Walnut,  Locust, 
Spruce,  and  the  intermediate  streets. 

The  Schuylkill  no  longer  bounds  us.     Improvement  is  now 
in  rapid  march  through  the  beautiful  District  of  West  Phila- 


16  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

delphia.  And  no  less  marvellous  are  the  changes  taking  place 
in  Southwark,  Moyaniensing,  &amp;c.  &amp;c.  Those  of  our  citizens 
whose  business  or  inclinations  keep  them  from  "  rambling 
around,"  will  be  astonished  and  bewildered  on  visiting  what 
they  are  apt  to  term  the  "  outskirts  of  the  city."  A  worthy 
gentleman,  residing  in  Chestnut  by  Delaware  Eighth  Street, 
remarked  to  us  the  other  day,  that  he  lately  took  a  walk  out 
west  of  Broad  Street,  "  and,"  said  he,  "  I  could  not  believe 
my  eyes ;  I  thought  this  could  not  possibly  be  Philadelphia. 
The  change,  sir,  is  most  wonderful  V 


LOCATION   AND    GENERAL   DESCRIPTION. 

This  beautiful  city  is  situated  on  a  plain,  bounded  on  the 
east  by  the  Iliver  Delaware,  on  the  west  by  the  River  Schuyl- 
kill, about  five  miles  above  their  junction.  "The  city,"  or 
that  part  of  it  incorporated  by  the  city  Charter,  and  under  its 
jurisdiction,  is  bounded  on  the  north  by  Vine  Street,  and  on 
the  south  by  Cedar  or  South  Street.  The  adjoining  districts 
of  Spring  Garden,  Penn,  Northern  Liberties,  Kensington,  and 
Richmond,  on  the  north,  West  Philadelphia,  &amp;c,  on  the  west, 
and  Southwark,  Moyamensing,  &amp;c,  on  the  south,  though 
governed  by  their  own  municipal  authorities,  ought  always  to 
be  considered  as  forming  a  portion  of  the  city,  in  a  general  and 
descriptive  view. 

The  length  of  Philadelphia,  from  the  lower  part  of  South- 
wark to  Richmond,  is  about  five  miles ;  its  breadth,  at  Market 
Street  (its  narrowest  part),  is  two  miles. 

The  soil  is  the  very  best  for  building  purposes,  consisting 
principally,  of  clay  of  various  colours  and  degrees  of  tenacity, 
beneath  which,  at  different  depths,  of  from  five  to  twenty  feet, 
is  found  coarse  gravel. 


LOCATION     AND    GENERAL    DESCRIPTION.  17 

Philadelphia  is,  perhaps,  the  most  healthy  city  in  the  United 
States.  The  air  is  sweet  and  clear,  the  sky  serene  and  seldom 
overcast.  The  streets  are  wide  and  airy,  crossing  at  right 
angles ;  they  surpass  all  others  in  the  world,  in  their  conve- 
nience for  trade  and  accommodation  for  passengers,  and  are 
well  paved  and  kept  remarkably  clean.  At  night  they  are 
well  lighted  with  gas. 

This  metropolis  is  not  celebrated  for  her  palaces,  yet  she  pos- 
sesses some  edifices  remarkable  for  both  grandeur  and  beauty. 
Her  buildings  are  more  distinguished  for  their  neatness  and 
comfort.  This  applies  to  both  public  buildings  and  private 
dwellings.  It  is  the  ambition  of  many  an  American  belle,  to 
be  mistress  of  a  "  Philadelphia  three-story  brick. "  To  live 
within  his  own  family  free  from  interruption,  contest,  or  in- 
trusion, to  have  his  house  clean  and  comfortable,  his  apart- 
ments adapted  to  their  several  purposes,  and  in  every  respect 
convenient,  is  our  citizen's  delight;  to  effect  all  these,  the  builder 
exerts  his  utmost  skill.  There  is — and  we  say  it  without 
fear  of  contradiction — no  other  city,  the  inhabitants  of  which 
enjoy  so  many  of  the  accommodations  art  can  afford,  as  those 
of  Philadelphia.  Let  foreigners  talk  of  their  splendid  palaces, 
mansions,  and  rich  dwellings ;  theirs  is  but  the  parade  of  pomp 
and  vanity,  ours  is  social  comfort. 

Most  of  the  houses  in  this  city  are  built  on  a  uniform  plan, 
being  generally  three  stories  high.  Within  the  last  few  years, 
however,  there  has  been  a  decided  advance  in  the  style  of 
building,  and  our  streets  are  now  being  adorned  with  edifices 
that  are  unrivalled  for  taste,  elegance,  and  convenience. 

The  original  plan  of  this  city  was  made  by  Thomas  Holmes, 
and  surveyed  in  1683,  in  which  nine  principal  streets  were 
laid  out  running  east  and  west,  and  twenty  running  north  and 
south.  Market,  or  High  Street,  intended  for  the  principal 
dwellings,  is  100  feet  wide,  Broad  is  113,  Arch,  or  Mulberry, 

2* 


18  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

66,  Front  60,  and  the  rest  50  feet  wide.  The  intermediate 
streets  were  subsequently  laid  out.  For  a  correct  plan  of  all 
of  which,  see  the  accompanying  map.  Dock  Street  is  the  only 
one  not  crossed  at  right  angles  in  the  city.  This  marks  the 
course  of  the  once  "Dock  Creek. "  In  olden  times,  trade  and 
commerce,  to  a  considerable  extent,  centred  along  its  banks ; 
vessels  came  up  as  far  as  Third  Street.  Early  writers  speak 
frequently  of  the  "  beautiful  prospect  along  the  green  banks 
of  the  pretty  Dock  Creek. "  In  the  winter,  it  was  a  fine 
"  skating-place  for  the  boys."  Subsequently  tan-yards,  &amp;c, 
took  up  their  location  here,  soon  rendering  it  a  place  "  dan- 
gerous to  the  health  of  the  city."  It  was  finally  filled  up  in 
1784. 

In  the  original  plan,  Penn  desired  to  preserve  a  clear  view 
of  the  River  Delaware  from  Front  Street,  restricting  the 
buildings  east  of  it  to  the  height  of  the  banks.  "What  a  noble 
promenade  and  exchange  walk  this  would  have  formed !  It 
was  also  his  intention  "  that  each  house  should  stand  in  the 
middle  of  its  lot,  so  as  to  leave  room  for  a  garden,  &amp;c.,  that 
Philadelphia  might  be  a  green  country  town,  which  might 
never  be  burned  down,  and  always  be  wholesome  \"  "What  a 
splendid  appearance  our  streets  would  now  present,  if  this 
idea  had  been  carried  out !  However,  we  must  take  the  city 
as  it  is,  and  be  thankful  that  it  is  so ;  for  few  can  rival  it  in 
the  health,  comfort,  pleasure,  and  happiness  of  its  inhabitants. 

Our  city  is  not  so  thickly  populated,  for  its  extent,  as  some 
others.  The  streets  are  wide,  and  the  inhabitants  of  every 
class  enjoy  more  room  than  usual  in  large  cities.  Not  only 
the  merchant,  wealthy  manufacturer,  and  persons  well  to  do  in 
the  world,  occupy  each  an  entire  dwelling,  but  tradesmen  of 
the  most  humble  class  can  have  a  house  to  themselves. 

In  1840,  the  population  of  the  city  and  county  was  258,037  ) 
at  present  it  is  about  440,000.  The  total  number  of  dwelling 
houses  in  Philadelphia  is  about  60,000. 


THE    COAL    TRADE.  19 

The  wonderful  increase  of  the  city  can  be  estimated  by  the 
fact,  that  there  has  been,  on  an  average,  over  3500  buildings 
erected  annually  for  the  past  three  years. 

During  the  last  year  our  commerce  has  increased  rapidly. 
At  present  there  are  one  line  of  first  class  steamers  and  four 
lines  of  sailing  packets  plying  between  this  port  and  Liverpool. 
One  line  of  two  fine  steamers,  running  to  Charleston,  South 
Carolina.  One,  viz.,  the  Union  Steamship  Company,  between 
Philadelphia,  Norfolk,  Petersburg,  and  Richmond,  Virginia. 
One  to  Boston,  viz.,  the  Philadelphia  and  Boston  Steam 
Packet  line,  of  two  splendid  vessels.  One  to  Hartford,  Con- 
necticut, two  to  New  York,  viz.,  the  New  York  and  Phila- 
delphia Independent  Steamship  line,  via  Cape  May,  and  the 
Philadelphia  and  New  York  Steam  Transportation  Company's 
Merchants'  and  Swiftsure  line,  and  one  to  Baltimore. 

Most  of  these  vessels  have  been  built  in  Philadelphia,  and 
are  unsurpassed  as  substantial  sea-boats.  The  total  number  of 
ships,  barques,  brigs,  schooners,  steamers,  barges,  &amp;c,  entered 
in  this  port  during  the  last  year,  was  about  30,000.  The  value 
of  imports,  during  the  same  period,  $14,500,000. 

The  Coal  Trade. — During  the  year  1850,  the  total  value  of 
anthracite  coal  sent  to  market  at  tidewater,  amounted  to  over 
sixteen  million  dollars.  Who  can  estimate  the  immense  in- 
crease of  this  valuable  trade  twenty  years  hence,  when  steam,  to 
a  great  extent,  shall  have  taken  the  place  of  sails,  in  vessels 
navigating  the  ocean  and  our  extended  coast  ? 

The  following  statement  shows  the  present  extent  of  this 
branch  of  domestic  commerce. 

The  quantity  of  coal  sent  to  market  from  the  Lehigh  in 
1850  was  7,029,002  tons.  From  the  Schuylkill,  15,176,623 
tons.  Lackawanna,  4,390,698  tons.  Pine  Grove,  525,733  tons. 
Lukens  Valley,  96,935.  Shamokin,  164,430  tons.  Wyoming, 
1,614,571,— being  a  total  of  28,998,286  tons.     Showing  an 


20  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

increase  over  the  preceding  year,  of  97,506  tons.  The  increase 
for  the  years  1851-52,  will,  it  is  evident  from  present  appear- 
ances, be  much  larger. 

The  manufactures  of  the  metropolis  are  very  important, 
both  as  regards  their  magnitude  and  value ;  indeed,  the  manu- 
facturing facilities  of  Philadelphia  are  unrivalled.  Her  vicinity 
abounds  in  immense  water-power,  and  coal  is  to  be  obtained 
from  our  own  mines  at  alow  price.  These,  with  the  advantages 
of  a  home  market,  must  continue  to  offer  inducements  to  the 
manufacturer  that  cannot  be  equalled  elsewhere.  The  goods 
and  wares  manufactured  here  consist  of  every  variety.  Articles 
of  elegant  use  are  brought  to  more  than  the  ordinary  degree  of 
perfection. 

The  following  statement,  showing  the  capital  invested  in 
manufacturing,  value  of  the  raw  material  consumed,  number 
of  hands  employed,  wages  paid,  and  the  value  of  the  annual 
product  of  this  branch  of  industry  in  this  City  and  Districts, 
during  the  year  ending  June  1st,  1850,  is  taken  from  the 
Census  returns,  furnished  us  by  A.  E.  Roberts,  Marshal  of 
the  Eastern  District  of  Pennsylvania,  viz. :  Capital  invested 
in  manufacturing,  832,737,911 ;  value  of  the  raw  material 
used,  including  fuel,  &amp;c.,  $33,515,366;  average  number  of 
male  hands  employed,  43,304;  average  number  of  females 
employed,  14,804;  average  monthly  cost  of  male  labour, 
$1,062,799 ;  average  monthly  cost  of  female  labour,  $208,584 ; 
value  of  the  annual  products,  $62,815,011. 

These  estimates  embrace  only  those  establishments  pro- 
ducing articles  to  the  annual  value  of  over  $500. 

We  close  these  remarks  with  the  following  extract  from  the 
last  Eeport  of  the  Philadelphia  Board  of  Trade.  After  alluding 
to  the  canals,  railroads,  and  other  improvements,  connected 
with  the  city,  together  with  those  in  contemplation,  it  goes  on 
to  say : 


MANUFACTURES.  21 

"  It  is  to  be  hoped  that  Philadelphia  will  not  be  content 
with  what  she  has  done.  Her  commercial  destiny  exacts  some- 
thing more  than  self-complacent  reflections  on  what  she  has 
accomplished ;  for  surely,  if  there  is  a  spot  on  the  face  of  the 
habitable  globe,  on  which  Nature,  in  the  collocation  and  accu- 
mulation of  her  stores  of  mineral  and  agricultural  wealth,  has 
smiled  benignantly  and  munificently,  it  is  on  this  city.  If 
intelligent  foreigners,  having  the  control  of  European  capital, 
could  be  induced  to  scale  the  walls  by  which  the  pretensions  of 
neighbouring  communities  endeavour  to  hide  us  from  view,  and 
come  here  and  examine  for  themselves  the  resources  and  capa- 
bilities of  Philadelphia  and  Pennsylvania — study,  as  suspiciously 
as  they  please,  the  social  and  moral  character  of  her  citizens, 
whether  commercial  men  or  not — find  them,  as  they  will,  with 
rare  exceptions,  homogeneous  as  a  population,  of  purely  Ameri- 
can conservative  sentiment,  untainted  by  the  fanaticism  and  dis- 
loyalty which  exists  in  one  direction,  and  oppressed  by  none 
of  the  social  institutions  which  exist  in  another; — if  capital  from 
abroad,  following  the  most  purely  selfish  instinct,  were  to  come 
here,  seeking  investments,  nowhere  could  they  be  found  more 
secure  than  in  the  internal  commerce,  the  manufactures,  the 
mining  enterprises  of  Pennsylvania — in  her  public  stocks,  .or 
in  her  real  estate."

PUBLIC   BUILDINGS.  23 


CHAPTER  I. 


PUBLIC   BUILDINGS. 


The  State  House,  or  Independence  Hall. — This  in- 
teresting relic  of  the  past  deserves  especial  notice,  and  few 
strangers  leave  our  city  without  visiting  its  venerated  halls.  It 
was  commenced  in  1129,  and  completed  in  1734.  The  size, 
style,  and  rich  interior  decorations  of  such  a  building,  at  so 
early  a  day,  are  an  evidence  of  the  public  spirit  of  our  former 
citizens.  The  architecture  and  plan  of  this  edifice  are  from 
designs  by  J.  Kearsely,  the  same  who  drew  the  plan  of 
Christ  Church.  The  builder  was  E.  Wooley.  The  original 
cost  was  £5600.  The  two  wings  were  erected  in  1740.  Al- 
though frequently  renovated,  it  presents  the  same  appearance 
now,  that  it  did  in  1776. 

In  the  east  room  of  the  first  story,  the  immortal  Declaration 
of  Independence  was  passed  by  Congress,  July  4th,  1776. 

There  are  places  which  possess,  in  a  peculiar  degree,  the 
power  of  awaking  sensations  in  the  mind.  In  their  effect,  we 
acknowledge  the  influence  which  has  been  so  beautifully  desig- 
nated, the  "  magic  of  a  scene. "  Such  an  influence  did  we  ex- 
perience, standing  in  this  "  relic  of  olden  days."  Everything 
in  the  room  leads  the  mind  back  to  the  memorable  time — to 
that  decisive  act,  which  has  consecrated  this  room  to  undying 
fame.  We  see  those  patriotic  men  pondering  on  the  magnitude 
of  the  step  about  to  be  taken.  Some  of  them  seem  to  waver. 
Silence  —  deep  and  solemn  silence,  reigns  throughout.  See 
li that  aged  man"  arise.  He  "casts  a  look  of  inexpressible 
interest  and  unconquerable  determination' '  on  his  fellow-pa- 
triots.    He  addresses  them.     Hear  him!     "There  is  a  tide

in  the  affairs  of  men,  a  nick  of  time ;  we  perceive  it  now  be- 
fore us.    That  noble  instrument  upon  your  table,  which  insures 
immortality  to  its  author,  should  be  subscribed  this  very  morn- 
ing, by  every  member  in  the  room.     He  who  will  not  respond 
to  its  call  is  unworthy  the  name  of  freeman  !     Although  these 
hairs  must  descend  into  the  tomb,  I  would  rather,  infinitely 
rather  they  should  descend  thither  by  the  hand  of  the  public 
executioner,  than  desert,  at  this  crisis,  the  sacred  cause  of  my 
country."     He  ceases,  but  the  fire  of  patriotism    is  kindled 
afresh  in  every  bosom,  and  "  forthwith  the  glorious  deed  is 
done."     We  behold  these  noble  men  peril  their  lives,  their 
fortunes,  and  sacred  honour,  in  the  just  and  holy  cause.*  John 
Hancock  takes  up  the  pen  and  signs  his  name  in  a  large,  bold 
hand,  and  then  rises,  saying :  "  There  !  John  Bull  can  read  my 
name  without  spectacles,  and  may  now  double  his  reward  for 
my  head.     That  is  my  defiance  !" 

Who  does  not  love  to  read  the  history  of  his  native  land,  and 
dwell  with  pleasure  upon  the  exploits  of  her  heroic  sons  ?  Is 
it  to  be  wondered,  then,  that  this  room,  so  intimately  connected 
with  our  national  existence,  recalls  a  hundred  scenes  from  the 
past  ?  This  is  the  shrine  of  American  liberty  !  Long  may  it 
remain  an  object  of  veneration  to  future  millions  of  freemen  ! 

The  west  room,  on  the  same  floor,  is  at  present  occupied  by 
the  Court  of  Common  Pleas. 

Proceeding  up  stairs,  we  come  to  the  "  Lobby,"  famed  in 
colonial  days  as  being  the  scene  of  many  a  sumptuous  feast. 
The  large  room  to  the  westward  was  the  Senate  chamber  of  the 
first  Congress.  In  the  rooms'  fronting  Chestnut  Street,  to  the 
cast,  the  Committees  of  Congress  in  177G  met  to  prepare  their 
various  reports.  The  "  Lobby"  at  that  time  extended  the 
entire   length  of  the  building  eastward  from  the  landing;  a 

•  That  venerable  patriot  was  JOBS  Witijerspoox  of  New  Jersey,  a  distinguished 
minister  of  the  Presbyterian  Church,  a  lineal  descendant  of  the  celebrated  John  Knox.

PHILADELPHIA  AND  LIVERPOOL  PACKETS. 

Sailing  from  Philadelphia  on  the  25th,  and  from  Liverpool  on  the  12th 

of  every  Month. 

TUSCARORA,  ....  CAPTAIN  TURLEY. 

TONAWANDA,  ....  CAPTAIN  JULIUS. 

WYOMING, CAPTAIN  DUNLEVY. 

SARANAC, CAPTAIN  MOLONY. 

These  ships  are  all  of  the  first  class,  recently  built  in  Philadel- 
phia ;  and  for  strength,  swiftness,  and  beauty  of  model,  as  well  as 
for  the  extent  and  comfort  of  accommodations  for  passengers,  are 
unsurpassed  by  any  in  the  trade. 

The  cabins  are  handsome  and  commodious ;  the  forward  cabins  and 
steerages  large,  airy,  and  well  lighted. 

The  captains  are  experienced  navigators,  and  kind  and  attentive 
to  the  comfort  of  passengers ;  and  skilful  surgeons  accompany  the 
ships. 

This  line  of  Packets  has  been  maintained  regularly  since  its  esta- 
blishment in  1822,  during  the  whole  time  losing  but  one  passenger 
from  accidents  of  the  sea. 

Persons  intending  to  embark  for  Liverpool,  or  desirous  of  bringing 
their  friends  thence  to  this  country,  can  secure  passage  in  the  cabin, 
forward  cabin,  or  steerage,  by  applying,  either  personally  or  by 
letter,  to  the  owners.

room  is  now  partitioned  off  it.  In  this  Lobby,  the  American 
officers  captured  at  the  battle  of  Grerniantown,  were  confined. 
In  it,  too,  many  a  noble  fellow,  wounded  at  the  battle  of 
Brandywine,  breathed  his  last.  (This  portion  of  the  building 
was  fitted  up  as  a  temporary  hospital  immediately  after  that 
battle.) 

The  whole  of  this  story  is  leased  by  the  General  Government, 
and  is  now  used  for  the  sittings  of  the  Circuit  and  District 
Courts  of  the  United  States  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Penn- 
sylvania. 

The  original  steeple  was  taken  down  in  1774,  the  woodwork 
being  found  in  a  state  of  decay.  The  present  one  was  erected 
in  1828,  and  is  as  near  like  the  old  structure  as  circumstances 
would  permit.  It  contains  an  excellent  clock,  the  four  dial- 
plates  of  which  are  of  ground  glass.  They  are  illuminated  at 
night,  in  the  summer  to  eleven,  and  in  the  winter  to  ten 
o'clock.  The  hours  are  struck  on  a  fine-toned  bell,  which  is  also 
used  to  give  the  alarm  and  indicate  the  direction  of  fires. 

The  "  Old  Bell,"  cast  purposely  for  this  edifice  when  first 
erected,  is  carefully  preserved  in  the  steeple.  It  was  imported 
from  England  in  1752,  "  but  got  cracked  by  the  stroke  of  a 
hammer  in  trying  the  sound."  It  was  recast,  under  the  direc- 
tion of  Isaac  Norris,  then  a  prominent  member  of  the  colonial 
Assembly :  to  him  we  are  indebted  for  the  prophetic  inscription 
which  it  bears. 


"The  motto  of  our  Father  band, 

Circled  the  world  in  its  embrace; 
'Twas  Liberty  throughout  the  land, 

And  good  to  all  their  brother  race  ! 
Long  here — within  the  pilgrim's  bell, 

Had  lingered — though  it  often  pealed — 
Those  treasured  tones  that  eke  should  tell 

When  Freedom's  proudest  scroll  was  sealed!"

encc  of  which  is  to  last  through  all  time.  Subsequently  it 
was  fractured;  and  it  is  now  preserved  as  a  hallowed  relic  of  the 
past. 

The  panoramic  view  of  the  city  from  the  steeple  is  strikingly 
beautiful. 

The  first  story  of  the  east  wing,  contains  the  offices  of  the 
Prothonotary  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  State,  the  Register 
of  Wills,  the  Recorder  of  Deeds,  and  the  Clerk  of  the  Orphans' 
Court.  In  the  second  story  is  the  room  used  for  the  sittings 
of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  State  for  the  Eastern  District  of 
Pennsylvania,  together  with  the  offices  of  the  Recorder  of  the 
city,  and  the  District  Attorney. 

In  the  first  story  of  the  west  wing,  are  the  offices  of  the 
Clerk  of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas,  the  Clerk  of  the  District 
Courts,  the  Clerk  of  the  Court  of  Quarter  Sessions,  and  the

County  Auditor's,  the  County  Treasurer's,  and  the  County 
Commissioners'  offices,  and  a  chamber  used  for  the  sittings  of 
the  County  Board. 

The  building  on  the  southwest  corner  of  Chestnut  and  Fifth 
Streets  is  the  City  Hall.  When  are  we  to  have  a  better  one  ? 
It  contains  the  Mayor's  Court  and  offices,  the  City  Clerk's,  the 
City  Treasurer's,  and  the  Watering  Committee's  offices ;  the 
Commissioner  of  City  Property,  and  the  City  Commissioners'

UMBRELLA  MANUFACTURE. 

WRIGHT,    BROTHERS    &amp;    Co., 
114  Market  Street. 

Since  the  days  when  men,  -who  ventured  to  use  this,  now  considered 
necessary  article,  were  hooted  after  in  the  streets,  umbrellas  have 
crept  into  use,  from  one  bold  innovator  to  another,  until  the  time 
when  its  value  as  a  highly  useful  and  health-preserving  article  was 
generally  acknowledged.  From  that  time  its  use  has  increased  so 
rapidly,  that  at  present  no  house,  and  scarcely  an  individual,  from 
Maine  to  California,  is  without  "My  Umbrella."  But,  seriously,  this 
branch  of  manufacture  is  acquiring  great  importance ;  it  is  now 
looked  upon  as  a  staple  article,  and  heavy  capitalists  readily  invest 
both  attention  and  vast  pecuniary  means,  in  a  production  long  treated 
with  ridicule. 

Of  the  vast  quantity  of  material  consumed  in  this  manufacture,  we 
can  give  some  idea  from  the  statistics  of  a  Philadelphia  house, 
Wright,  Brothers  &amp;  Co.,  one  of  the  oldest  and  heaviest  in  the  United 
States,  and  who  manufacture  about  one-tenth  of  all  the  Umbrellas 
used  in  America. 

This  house  produces  an  average  of  1000  umbrellas  and  parasols  a 
day,  or  300,000  per  annum,  and  consumes  550,000  yards — equal  to 
320  miles — of  silks,  cottons,  and  ginghams;  upwards  of  100,000  pounds 
of  rattan ;  about  38  tons,  or  200,000  pieces  of  horn,  bone,  and  other 
ornamental  mountings.  Of  whalebone,  the  house  alluded  to  above 
consumes  100,000  pounds,  equal  to  about  one-thirtieth  of  the  average 
product  of  the  whale  fisheries  of  the  world. 

Such  is  the  extent  and  variety  of  the  mechanism  used,  and  the  per- 
fection and  nicety  with  which  it  is  adapted  to  the  purpose,  that,  with 
the  help  of  ample  steam  power,  all  this  vast  quantity  of  material 
changes  its  form,  and  300,000  Umbrellas  are  manufactured  in  the 
establishment  of  the  Messrs.  Wright,  with  the  help  of  only  300  hands, 
constantly  employed  under  one  roof.  All  parts  of  the  umbrella  are 
now  arranged  with  mathematical  accuracy  by  the  machinery  used, 
some  of  which  was  invented  by  one  of  the  proprietors  of  the  establish- 
ment, from  Avhich  the  above  information  was  obtained,  and  can  be 
used  by  no  other  manufactory.  The  system  to  which  all  parts  of  this 
branch  of  manufacture  are  reduced,  is  now  so  perfect  as  to  place  the 
cost  of  production  very  low ;  and  the  few  immense  establishments 
with  this  powerful  aid  of  extensive  and  appropriate  mechanical  con- 
trivances are  fast  swallowing  up  the  smaller  shops,  and  placing  their 
goods  far  below  competition  from  hand  labour  and  ordinary  machinery 
— in  addition  to  forming  the  article  with  a  beauty  and  accuracy  only 
to  be  obtained  from  the  best  mechanical  means.

UNITED     STATES     CUSTOM     HOUSE. 

The  Custom  House,  formerly  the  United  States  Bank, 
situated  on  the  south  side  of  Chestnut  above  Fourth  Street, 
is  a  splendid  marble  edifice.  It  has  two  fronts,  one  on  Chest- 
nut, and  one  on  Library  Street,  each  ornamented  by  eight 
fluted  columns  of  the  Doric  order,  27  feet  high,  and  4  feet  6 
inches  in  diameter,  supporting  a  heavy  entablature  of  the 
same  order.  It  is  in  imitation  of  the  celebrated  Parthenon  at 
Athens.  The  structure  is  built  upon  a  platform,  87  feet  in 
front  and  161  feet  deep.  The  view  from  Chestnut  Street  is  much 
enhanced  by  its  elevation  and  recession.  It  bears  altogether 
the  features  of  unassuming  grandeur,  and  chaste  simplicity. 

The  principal  apartment  is  81  feet  long  by  48  wide,  richly 
ornamented  by  fluted  Ionic  columns,  and  sculptured  embel- 
lishments.

PUBLIC     BUILDINGS.  35 

This  beautiful  edifice  was  commenced  in  1819,  and  completed 
in  1824,  at  an  expense  of  about  8500,000.  The  United  States 
government  purchased  it  at  about  one  half  of  its  original  cost. 
This  building  is  considered  one  of  the  purest  specimens  of 
Doric  architecture,  erected  in  modern  days. 

Custom  House  Stores,  Second  below  Dock  Street,  together

Warden  of  the  Port.  —  By  an  Act  of  Assembly,  the 
Governor  is  authorized  to  appoint  one  master  warden,  whose 
term  of  office  extends  to  three  years ;  thirteen  assistant  war- 
dens are  appointed  by  the  City  Councils  and  Commissioners 
of  the  adjoining  districts  annually. 

The  duty  of  these  officers  is  to  grant  licenses  to  pilots,  to 
make  rules  for  their  government,  and  to  decide  all  questions 
of  dispute  between  them  and  the  owners  and  captains  of  vessels ; 
to  determine  the  construction  and  extent  of  wharves,  &amp;c.  An 
appeal  from  their  decision  to  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  can 
be  made,  provided  it  is  done  within  six  days  after  judgment. 

The  Governor  also  appoints  Inspectors  to  superintend  and 
inspect  various  articles  of  merchandise  for  exportation,  viz., 
shingles,  lumber,  ground  barks,  distilled  spirits,  beef  and  pork, 
flour,  fish,  butter,  lard,  flaxseed,  grain,  &amp;c.  He  also  appoints 
a  Harbour  Master,  to  direct  the  mooring  of  ships,  and  the 
order  in  which  they  shall  load  and  unload  at  the  wharves,  &amp;c.

MARKETS. 


Few  cities  can  boast  of  markets  better  supplied  with  the 
bounties  of  nature  than  Philadelphia.  Let  the  reader,  particu- 
larly if  a  stranger,  take  a  tour  of  observation  through  them, 
especially  on  Wednesday  and  Saturday  mornings,  and  he  will 
behold  an  exceedingly  interesting  and  gratifying  spectacle.  He 
will  find  those  buildings  well  supplied  with  all  kinds  of  meat, 
poultry,  game,  fish,  vegetables,  fruit,  &amp;c,  while  the  streets  in  the 
immediate  vicinity  are  crowded  in  all  directions  with  well-filled 
baskets. 

These  markets,  distributed  throughout  the  city,  embrace  al- 
together over  forty  entire  squares,  in  addition  to  the  range  of 
wagon  stands  on  Market  Street  and  Second  Street,  which  of 
themselves  form  a  line  equal  in  extent  to  three  miles.  There 
are  inspectors  appointed  by  the  city  and  district  authorities, 
whose  duty  it  is  to  enforce  the  regulations  respecting  the 
weight,  &amp;c,  to  see  that  no  unwholesome  food  is  offered  for  sale, 
and  that  the  stalls  and  buildings  are  kept  clean  and  in  order. 
The  locations  of  the  markets  are  as  follows. 

High  Street  Market. — Those  long  ranges  of  buildings  that 
line  this  noble  avenue,  were  not  contemplated  in  the  original 
plan  of  the  city.  Penn  designed  Centre  Square  for  this  purpose. 
The  first  of  these  houses  was  erected  in  1710;  it  extended 
half  way  up  from  Second  Street.  In  1729,  it  was  carried  up 
to  Third  Street,  where,  for  a  long  period,  it  was  marked  with 
the  appendages  of  Pillory,  Stocks,  and  Whipping  Post.  (The  last 
remembered  criminal  punished  here,  was  a  genteel  store-keeper, 
convicted  of  forgery.  The  gentleman  made  amends  to  an  in- 
jured public,  by  having  his  face  well  pelted  with  rotten  eggs, 
and  his  ears  clipped  by  the  sheriff.)  In  the  same  year,  councils 
erected  twenty  stalls  "  for  the  accommodation  of  such  as  bring 

provisions  from  New  Jersey."    These  were  moveable  stalls,  and

were  placed  east  of  Second  Street.  The  present  New  Jersey 
market  was  erected  in  1765.  A  portion  of  this  building  was 
used  for  several  years  as  an  Exchange.  In  1773,  the  markets 
were  extended  to  Fourth  Street.  These  encroachments  on  the 
beautiful  High  Street  met  with  much  and  determined  opposition 
as  being  "  shameful  obstructions."  Finally,  the  "  market  in- 
terests'' prevailed,  and  the  extensions  gradually  went  on. 
They  now  reach  from  the  Delaware  to  Eighth  Street,  and  from 
Schuylkill  Sixth  to  Schuylkill  Eighth  Street.  In  1836,  the 
old  market-houses  were  torn  down,  and  the  present  light  and 
airy  structures  erected.  This  change  was  rendered  necessary 
to  allow  passage-room  for  the  city  railroad. 

South  Second  Street  Market  extends  from  Pine  to  Cedar

North  Second  Street  Market  extends  from  Coates  to

contemplate  extending  it  still  further  west.

Eleventh  Street  Market,  Moyamensing,  Eleventh 
Street,  extends  from  Shippen  to  Fitzwater  Street. 

The    wholesale   provision  trade  is  carried  on  by  extensive 

firms,  principally  located  along  the  wharves  and  Water  Street, 

•  where  immense  warehouses  extend  for  squares,  filled  with  the 

rich  products  of  our  own  valley,  or  with  the  teas,  coffee,  sugar, 

spices,  wines,  &amp;c,  of  foreign  lands. 

WATER-WORKS. 

The  Fairmount  Water-works,  from  which  the  City  of 
Philadelphia  is  supplied  with  water,  is  situated  on  the  east 
hank  of  the  Schuylkill  River,  a  short  distance  above  the  boun- 
dary line  of  the  city  proper,  at  which  place  a  water-power  was 
obtained  by  the  erection  of  a  dam  across  the  river.     This  dam 
was  built  by  sinking  wooden  cribs  filled  with  stone;  it  is  1248 
feet  long,  part  being  founded  upon  rock,  which  is  dry  at  low 
tide,  and  the  remainder  being  sunk  through  mud  to  rock,  in 
some  places  to  the  depth  of  30  feet  below  high  tide.    This  dam 
was   erected  in   1819,  and  has  successfully  withstood  seven 
freshets,  in  two  instances  having  as  much  as  ten  and  a  half  feet 
of  water  flowing  over  it.    The  water  backed  up  by  the  dam  is 
conducted  into  a  forebay  on  the  back  and  east  side  of  the  mill- 
buildings,  the  whole  of  which  forebay,  as  well  as  the  site  upon 
which  the  mill-buildings  stand,  was  excavated  from  the  solid 
rock;  the  length  of  this  race  or  forebay  is  419 feet,  and  the 
depth  of  the  excavation  necessary  to  form  it  was  60  feet.    The 
forebay  is  90  feet  wide,  and  6  feet  deep  below  the  top  of  the 
dam,  which  allows  a  passage  of  the  water  to  the  mill-buildings, 
on  its  west  side  to  the  wheels,  which  discharge  the  water  into 
the  river  below.     The  mill-building  is  of  stone,  238  feet  long 
and  56  feet  wide,  divided  into  12  apartments,  four  of  which  con- 
tain 8   double-acting  forcing  pumps,  16  inches  in  diameter, 
and  6  feet  stroke ;  the  other  apartments,  are  forebays  leading  to 
eight  water-wheels.     On  the  east  front  of  the  mill-buildings,

over  the  pump  and  forebay  chambers,  is  a  terrace  256  feet  long, 
and  26  feet  wide,  paved  with  brick,  forming  a  handsome  walk 
along  the  race.  Three  of  the  water-wheels  are  formed  of  wood, 
but  the  remainder  are  of  cast  iron,  varying  in  size  from  16  to 
18  feet  in  diameter,  all,  however,  being  15  feet  wide.  These 
wheel-pumps  are  each  calculated  to  raise  into  the  reservoir 
about  one  and  a  half  million  gallons  of  water  per  twenty-four 
hours;  they  elevate  the  water  a  perpendicular  height  of  92  feet. 
Each  pump  has  its  own  distinct  main,  of  sixteen  inches  in 
diameter,  running  up  into  the  reservoir.  The  water  in  the  re- 
servoirs, when  they  are  full,  is  102  feet  above  low  tide  in  the 
Schuylkill,  and  56  feet  above  the  highest  ground  in  the  city. 
The  reservoirs  are  built  with  stone  walls,  paved  upon  the  bottom 
with  bricks  laid  in  cement  upon  puddled  clay.  The  depth  of 
water  in  them,  when  full,  is  12  feet  3  inches;  there  are  four 
main  reservoirs,  divided  by  stone  walls,  containing  together 
22,031,976  ale  gallons.  The  larger  portion  of  these  reservoirs 
are  upon  artificial  ground,  raised  in  some  parts  forty  feet  above 
the  original  of  the  hill.  The  cost  of  all  the  reservoirs  was 
$133,822.  The  water  passes  from  the  reservoirs  to  the  city 
through  three  iron  mains,  one  of  20  inches  diameter,  one  of  22 
inches  diameter,  and  one  of  30  inches  diameter;  and  is  then 
distributed  through  the  city  in  pipes  from  3  to  30  inches 
diameter.     The  whole  length  of  these  pipes  being  as  follows.

WATER-WORKS.  51 

Upwards  of  81  miles  in  the  city  proper  only.  The  water 
is  also  supplied  to  the  districts  of  Southwark  and  Moyamensing 
through  26J  miles  of  pipes  more.  During  the  year  1850,  the 
supply  of  water  to  the  city  and  lower  districts  averaged  through- 
out the  whole  year  4,785,338  ale  gallons  per  day.  The  average 
supply  for  the  months  of  June  and  July,  was  however  6,247,209 
gallons  per  day.  This  supply  was  furnished  to  27,550  water 
tenants.  In  the  city,  there  are  6-18  fire  hydrants,  for  use  in 
case  of  fire,  and  in  the  lower  districts  272  more.  The  amount 
of  water  rents  for  1851,  per  duplicate  books,  is  $138,874  42. 
The  water-works  at  Fairrnount  were  started  July  1,  1822, 
and  from  the  commencement  to  December  31,  1850,  including 
the  cost  of  erection,  and  with  the  yearly  additions  to  the  works 
themselves,  together  with  the  extensions  of  the  iron  pipes  in 
the  city  each  year,  they  have  cost  81,615,169  82.  The  whole 
of  these  works  (with  the  exception  of  the  dam  across  the  river), 
including  the  plan  of  distribution  of  the  water  in  the  city,  were 
designed  and  executed  by  the  late  Frederick  Graff,  Esq. ;  and  for 
efficiency  and  simplicity  are  not  exceeded  by  any  similar  works 
now  in  operation. — The  City  of  Philadelphia  was  the  first  in 
the  United  States  that  possessed  a  water-works,  it  being  sup- 
plied by  steam  power  previous  to  the  erection  of  the  present 
works  at  Fairmount;  it  has  therefore  served  as  a  model  for 
almost  all  public  improvements  of  this  kind  erected  in  the 
country.

are  36  inches  diameter,  and  6  feet  stroke ;  the  pump  cylinders 
are  18  inches  diameter,  and  6  feet  stroke.  The  fly-wheel 
attached  to  one  engine  is  18  feet  in  diameter,  the  rim  weigh- 
ing 8840  lbs. ;  the  working  velocity  is  about  13  revolutions 
per  minute. 

The  boilers  are  each  13  feet  8  inches  in  length,  by  7  feet  9 
inches;  they  are  so  arranged  that  either  engine  may  receive 
steam  from  one  or  both  boilers  :  the  steam-pipes,  &amp;c,  are 
clothed  in  woollen  and  cased  in  wood ;  the  boilers  are  enclosed 
with  brick :  average  working  pressure  of  steam  is  16  lbs.  to  the 
square  inch,  and  the  cut-off  valves  are  worked  at  half  stroke. 

There  are  two  ascending  mains,  of  18  inches  diameter  each. 
Total  distance  from  the  pump  to  the  reservoir,  is  3250  feet; 
the  elevation  of  the  reservoir  from  low-water  mark  is  115  feet. 

The  reservoir  is  beautifully  situated  a  short  distance  to  the 
west  of  Girard  College;  it  is  capable  of  containing  9,800,000 
gallons;  its  depth  is  15  feet,  the  banks  of  which  are  com- 
posed of  earth,  the  whole  being  lined  with  a  course  of  clay 
and  gravel  puddle-stuff,  and  faced  with  a  brick  pavement,  laid 
in  the  bottom  flat,  and  edgewise  on  the  sides.  It  is  divided 
into  two  apartments. 

There  are  two  distributing  mains,  16  inches  diameter  each. 

This  valuable  work  was  completed,  at  a  cost  of  §159,074  65, 
in  the  year  1845.

In  the  year  1835,  the  erection  of  the  Philadelphia  Gas-works 
was  authorized  by  the  corporation  of  the  city,  and  a  moderate 
outlay  contemplated,  for  the  purpose  of  testing  the  economy 
and  usefulness  of  such  an  establishment.  Many  of  our  most 
intelligent  citizens  doubted  the  propriety  of  such  an  undcr-

taking ;  and  although  its  accomplishment  was  secured  without 
any  liability  on  the  part  of  the  city,  they  shrunk  from  what 
was  considered  a  novel  and  unsafe  means  of  furnishing  arti- 
ficial light.  Now,  happily,  all  these  apprehensions  have  yielded 
to  an  enlarged  experience,  and  we  question  whether  there  is 
any  respectable  member  of  the  community  willing  to  abandon 
a  system,  that,  so  far,  has  worked  so  well.  Indeed,  in  the  pos- 
session of  the  Fairmount  "Water-works  and  the  Philadelphia 
Gas-works,  our  citizens  occupy  a  position  of  proud  superiority 
over  those  of  her  sister  cities. 

The  entire  area  occupied  by  this  establishment  is  about 
seven  acres  and  a  half,  with  a  river  front  of  800  feet.  The 
buildings  constituting  the  works  are  arranged  into  two  gene- 
ral divisions,  A  and  B,  but  conveniently  described  as  the  old 
and  new  works.  Each  division  is  composed  of  subordinate 
sections,  numbered  1,  2,  3,  4,  in  the  old,  and  1  and  2  in  the 
new  group. 

Every  section  is  a  complete  and  independent  gas  factory, 
capable  of  being  worked  unconnected  with  all  the  others,  as  a 
separate  and  distinct  establishment,  but  the  whole  are  ar- 
ranged symmetrically,  and  are  susceptible  of  connexion,  so 
that  gas  produced  in  any  section  may  be  passed  through  the 
purifying  apparatus  and  meter  of  any  other,  at  will. 

The  separate  buildings  comprise  two  retort-houses,  two  puri- 
fying-houses, two  meter-rooms,  containing  six  station  meters 
and  four  conical  governors,  two  ranges  of  workshops,  and  coke- 
sheds  and  offices,  three  coal-stores,  two  perpetual  lime-kilns, 
and  eleven  gas-holders. 

The  retort-houses  are  195  feet  long  and  48  feet  wide,  com- 
prising eight  sections,  containing  240  retorts ;  they  are  built  of 
brick,  and  rest  upon  arches  supported  by  cast  iron  girders, 
giving  space  for  the  storage  of  over  50,000  bushels  of  coal 
beneath  the  floors;  the  roof  frames  are  of  wrought  iron,  covered 
with  slate ;  the  height  of  the  chimneys  is  100  feet.

GAS-WORKS.  57 

The  range  of  offices,  meter-room,  and  workshop,  belonging 
to  the  old  works,  is  133  feet  by  20,  the  coke-shed  170  by  24 
feet,  and  the  coal-shed  80  by  50  feet,  arranged  around  a 
hollow  square.  The  extent  of  the  range  of  offices,  smithshop, 
and  meter-house  of  the  new  works,  is  122  by  120  feet ;  the  coke- 
shed,  store-rooms,  &amp;c,  270  by  22  feet. 

Between  the  retort-houses  is  an  underground  coal-store,  40 
by  190  feet,  capable  of  containing  40,000  bushels. 

The  lime-kilns  are  built  of  stone,  in  the  usual  form  of  per- 
petual kilns. 

The  southern  coal-store  is  constructed  in  four  sections,  100 
feet  long,  30  feet  wide,  joined  side  by  side,  so  that  they  consti- 
tute one  building,  100  by  120  feet,  with  a  roof  supported  on 
stone  piers  18  feet  high;  its  capacity  is  about  200,000  bushels. 

The  old  works  contain  8  gas-holders,  of  50  feet  diameter 
and  35,000  cubic  feet  capacity  each.  Of  those  connected  with 
the  new  division,  two  are  of  80  feet  diameter,  containing 
200,000  cubic  feet  each,  and  one  of  140  feet  diameter,  with  a 
capacity  of  one  million  cubic  feet !  all  of  the  telescope  form. 
The  guide  frames  of  these  gas-holders  are  entirely  of  cast  iron ; 
those  of  the  80-feet  holders,  are  composed  of  6  stands  of  fluted 
columns,  arranged  in  pairs,  with  an  entablature  to  each  pair, 
and  raised  to  three  tiers  in  height,  there  being  36  columns  to 
each  gas-holder,  the  whole  bound  together  at  the  top  by  iron 
open-work  girders.  The  large  holder  is  guided  by  twelve  sets 
of  columns,  standing  in  groups  of  three,  raised  four  tiers  high ; 
the  lower  tier  is  of  the  Tuscan,  the  second  Doric,  the  third 
Ionic,  and  the  upper  the  Corinthian  order  of  architecture. 
The  number  of  columns  is  144,  and  the  whole  height  of  the 
structure  above  the  coping  of  the  tank,  is  seventy-four  feet,  and 
the  depth  of  the  tank  thirty-six  feet. 

A  high  standard  of  illuminating  quality  of  gas  has  been 
adopted  and  constantly  maintained  at  these  works,  by  the  use

of  the  proper  varieties  of  coals,  or  by  the  addition  of  a  propor- 
tion of  resin  when  the  coals  should  chance  to  fall  below  the 
proper  standard. 

The  quality  aimed  at,  is  that  designated  "  twenty-candle 
gas ;"  that  is  to  say,  the  light  of  an  argand  burner,  consuming 
four  feet  an  hour,  is  equal  to  that  of  twenty  sperm  candles, 
six  to  the  pound  :  this  quality  has  generally  been  obtained, 
without  the  aid  of  resin,  by  the  use  of  certain  varieties  of  coals 
from  the  western  part  of  our  own  State. 

The  quantity  of  gas  manufactured  during  the  year,  is  one 
hundred  and  eighty-two  millions  and  sixteen  thousand  cubic 
feet.  The  maximum  production  in  24  hours  is  eight  hundred 
and  eighty-seven  thousand  cubic  feet.  The  highest  consumption 
during  the  same  period  was  one  million  and  twelve  thousand 
feet.  A  more  definite  notion  of  the  magnitude  of  this  volume 
of  gas  will  be  obtained,  by  converting  it  into  gallons,  of  which 
it  will  make  seven  and  a  half  millions,  or  about  the  same  as  the 
daily  consumption  of  hydrant  water  in  the  summer  months. 

The  extent  of  main  pipes  laid  in  the  streets,  is  five  hundred 
thousand  two  hundred  and  sixty-seven  feet,  or  about  94  f 
miles  !  The  number  of  meters  in  use  is  9,238,  and  the  whole 
number  of  customers  on  the  books,  is  9,216,  using  115,004 
lights,  besides  1,464  in  the  streets,  50  in  the  market-houses, 
and  62  in  the  public  squares.  The  total  extent  of  street, 
main,  and  service  pipe,  is  nearly  115  miles. 

Extensive  as  are  these  works,  it  appears  that  they  will  not 
be  adequate  to  supply  the  increasing  demand ;  it  is  therefore 
proposed  to  erect  new  works.  A  desirable  location  has  been 
obtained  for  this  purpose,  containing  about  70  acres,  at  Point 
Breeze,  immediately  on  the  banks  of  the  Biver  Schuylkill,  in 
which  additional  works  are  to  be  erected  at  once.  It  is  con- 
templated, in  time,  to  remove  the  old  works  to  this  place 
entirely.

THE    NAVY    YARD.  61 

Spring  Garden  District  Gas-works  are  located  on  the 
east  bank  of  the  Schuylkill,  below  Fairinount. 

Northern  Liberties  Gas-works  are  situated  on  Laurel 
near  Beach  Street. 

The  Navy  Yard. — This  national  establishment  is  situated 
on  the  banks  of  the  River  Delaware  in  the  District  of  Southwark. 
The  grounds  embrace  about  twelve  acres,  which  were  purchased 
by  the  General  Government,  in  1801,  for  the  sum  of  $37,500. 
The  present  assessment  is  $250,000.  By  an  act  of  Assembly, 
passed  in  1818,  no  street  is  to  be  run  through  the  property, 
while  occupied  for  its  present  purpose.  The  area  is  enclosed  on 
three  sides  by  a  substantial  brick  wall ;  the  fourth  side  fronts 
on  the  river.  The  various  buildings  are  the  officers'  residence, 
quarters  for  the  marines,  &amp;c,  the  moulding  lofts  (the  most  spa- 
cious in  the  country  for  modelling  ships  of  war),  workshops 
and  store-houses, — and  two  ship-houses,  one  of  them  being 
the  largest  in  the  United  States.  It  is  270  feet  long  103  feet 
high,  and  84  feet  wide.  The  other  house  is  210  feet  in  length, 
80  in  height,  and  74  in  width. 

To  the  south  of  these  houses  is 

The  United  States  Dry  Docks. — They  consist  of  a 
Sectional  Floating  Dry  Dock  of  nine  sections,  capable  of  raising 
the  largest  steam  vessels  and  ships  of  the  line.  Nine  years'  ex- 
perience in  the  harbour  of  New  York,  has  proved  that  this 
dock  for  the  repairing  of  vessels  possesses  the  greatest  facility 
for  docking,  and  that  it  has  many  advantages  over  the  ordinary 
stone  dock.  When  the  vessel  is  raised  from  the  water,  she 
rests  upon  keel  and  bilge  blocks,  her  entire  length  being  sup- 
ported by  them  or  by  shoring,  if  desirable,  upon  a  floor  as  long 
as  may  be  required,  and  105  feet  wide.  Her  keel  being  above 
the  surface  of  the  water,  her  whole  bottom  and  bilge  are  ex-

CHILSON'S  PATENT  AIR  WARMING 


AND 


Final  Improvements  Patented  November  19th,  1851, 

FOR  THOROUGHLY  WARMING  AND  VENTILATING  DWELLINGS,  CHURCHES, 
SCHOOLHOUSES,  COURTHOUSES,  HOSPITALS,  STORES,  ETC. 

A  complete  and  perfect  system  of  ventilating,  as  well  as  warming 
buildings,  with  an  abundant  supply  of  fresh,  healthful  warm  air, 
(uninjured  in  the  process  of  warming  by  overheated  iron)  creating  a 
salubrious  atmosphere  in  the  apartments  warmed,  not  unlike  that  of 
a  mild  summer's  day.  This  invention  is  unlike  anything  of  the 
common  hot  air  furnaces  or  heater  kind,  and  is  the  result  of  many 
years'  thorough  practical  experience  in  the  invention  and  manufac- 
ture of  various  kinds  of  heaters,  and  in  fully  developing  and  perfect- 
ing this  principle.  Every  part  of  this  Furnace  and  plan  of  setting  it 
have  been  thoroughly  subjected  to  the  most  severe  practical  tests,  to 
insure  its  perfect  operation,  in  every  respect,  in  accordance  with  the 
laws  of  nature  that  govern  the  elements  of  air  and  heat.  Particular 
care  has  been  paid  to  attain  the  following  points,  viz. :  to  secure  all 
the  heat  generated  from  the  fuel,  and  avoid  all  overheated  pots  or 
plates ;  to  prevent  the  escape  and  loss  of  heat  in  cellars ;  to  connect 
the  joints  so  as  to  allow  expansion,  and  yet  proof  against  the  escape 
of  smoke  or  gas ;  to  insure  great  durability.  Unlike  the  common 
furnaces,  it  requires  no  repairs,  with  ordinary  care,  during  a  lifetime. 
It  is  perfectly  safe  against  firing  buildings.  It  is  not  complicated  in 
its  arrangement,  nor  liable  to  get  out  of  order,  and  easily  managed. 

We  are  permitted  to  refer  to  over  eight  hundred  gentlemen  having 
these  furnaces  in  use,  some  in  public,  and  others  in  private  buildings, 
many  of  whom  are  professional  gentlemen,  whose  scientific  attain- 
ments in  such  matters  are  well  known. 

These  Furnaces  have  been  exhibited  four  times  at  the  recent  fairs, 
and  have  received  as  first  premiums  one  Gold  and  three  Silver 
Medals ;  also  the  highest  premium  at  the  World's  Fair. 

We  have  also  five  sizes  of  a  superior  Portable  Furnace,  combining 
the  principles  of  the  Brick  Furnace ;  also  a  complete  assortment  of 
Registers,  Hot  Air  Grates,  Ventilators,  and  every  variety  of  Warming 
and  Ventilating  Apparatus,  adapted  to  all  classes  of  buildings. 

Also  a  full  assortment  of  those  beautiful  and  substantial  Metallic 
or  Mirror  Marble  Chimney  Mantels,  Parlour  and  Chamber  Frame

posed  to  light,  and  dry  air,  enabling  mechanics  to  work  at  a 
much  less  cost,  and  with  less  danger  to  health,  than  when  con- 
fined to  the  narrow  and  wet  bottom  of  a  stone  dock,  rendered 
dark  by  the  projection  of  the  bilge  and  guards  of  a  vessel. 

In  connexion  with  this  Floating  Dry  Dock,  a  basin  and  two 
sets  of  level  ways  have  been  constructed,  multiplying  the  capacity 
of  the  works  to  that  of  three  of  the  largest  stone  docks  in  the 
world,  each  set  of  ways  being  fitted  to  receive  the  largest  steam 
vessel  or  ship  of  the  line.  The  bottom  of  the  basin  is  hori- 
zontal, and  350  feet  long,  by  226  feet  wide,  enclosed  by  a  wall 
of  granite,  except  upon  the  river  front,  three  feet  higher  than 
ordinary  high  tides.  The  floor  and  the  walls  of  the  basin  rest 
upon  a  pile  foundation,  capped  with  heavy  timbers,  covered  with 
6  inch  plank,  over  which  a  granite  floor,  10  inches  thick,  has 
been  laid.  The  masonry  of  the  works  is  all  laid  in  hydraulic 
cement.  The  ways  also  rest  upon  piles,  capped  with  timber, 
covered  with  large  blocks  of  granite. 

When  a  vessel  requires  extensive  repairs,  the  floating  dock, 
with  the  vessel  on  it,  is  made  to  rest  on  the  solid  floor  of  the 
basin,  by  letting  water  into  it ;  a  sliding  frame,  or  cradle,  is 
placed  under  her  keel  and  bilges,  and  a  powerful  hydraulic  cy- 
linder, connected  with  the  centre  way,  is  attached  to  the  cradle. 
She  is  then  slid  from  the  floating  dock  by  the  hydraulic  power 
upon  one  of  the  sets  of  ways. 

The  contract  price  for  the  Sectional  Floating  Dry  Dock,  was 
8402,683;  and  for  the  basin,  two  railways,  hydraulic  cylinder, 
&amp;c,  $411,059,  making  for  the  three  capacities  or  docks  the 
total  sum  of  8813,742. 

These  works  were  commenced  in  the  month  of  January,  1849, 
and  completed  in  the  month  of  June,  1851.  Colonel  Burnett, 
U.  S.  Engineer,  superintended  their  construction.

UNITED     STATES     MINT. 


The  United  States  Mint. — This  national  establishment 
is  located  in  Chestnut  near  Broad  Street.  The  act  of  Con- 
gress for  the  establishment  and  regulation  of  a  Mint  was 
passed  in  1792.  In  1829  an  additional  act  was  passed  for 
the  enlargement  of  its  operations,  and  in  the  same  year  the 
corner-stone  of  the  present  building  was  laid.  It  presents  a 
front  of  122  feet,  divided  into  a  portico  62  feet  long,  and  two 
wings  80  feet  each.  The  structure  is  of  the  Ionic  order,  taken 
from  a  Grecian  temple  at  Athens.  The  portico  is  supported 
by  six  beautiful  pillars,  25  feet  high,  and  3  feet  in  diameter.  It 
is  a  brick  edifice  faced  with  marble  ashlar. — This  is  a  suitable 
and  extensive  establishment  for  the  purpose  of  coinage.  The 
steam  engine  and  mechanical  contrivances  used  in  the  milling, 
stamping,  &amp;c,  are  the  most  beautiful  that  can  be  imagined. 
Visiters  are  admitted  every  day  from  9  to  12  o'clock,  except 
Saturdays  and  Sundays.

PHILADELPHIA    POST-OFFICE.  67 

Philadelphia  Post-Office. — There  is  no  possible  event 
that  would  cause  so  great  a  revolution  in  the  world,  as  the 
cessation  of  "  The  Post."  It  would  be  a  sort  of  imprisonment 
to  the  universal  mind — a  severing  of  affections — a  congelation 
of  thought.  It  would  be  building  up  a  wall  of  separation 
between  the  hearts  of  mother  and  child,  husband  and  wife,  and 
brother  and  sister;  it  would  raise  Alps  between  the  breasts  of 
friend  and  friend,  and  extinguish,  as  with  an  ocean,  the  love 
that  is  now  breathed  out  in  all  its  glowing  fervour,  despite  time 
and  space. 

If  ever  man  deserved  a  monument,  it  was  the  inventor  of 
writing.  Who  was  he  ?  It  is  the  next  best  gift  to  life  itself; 
but  without  the  medium  of  the  post,  it  would  be  divested  of 
half  its  advantages.  Government  and  the  wealthy,  it  is  true, 
could  send  their  messengers ;  but  these  would  not  avail  to  any 
extent  the  merchant,  and  not  at  all  the  tradesman  or  artisan, 
who  now  can  receive  the  most  needful  intelligence,  or  kindest 
effusions  of  regard,  from  any  distance  for  almost  nothing. 

To  depict  all  the  interests  connected  with  the  post,  would  be 
to  read  the  history  of  human  life  ;  there  is  no  interest  that  con- 
cerns the  happiness  of  man  carried  on  and  perfected  without  it. 
It  is  the  most  perfect  system  of  intercourse  that  has  ever  been 
devised, — it  scatters  wealth  and  joy  in  a  thousand  directions; 
no  place  is  too  remote,  no  village  too  insignificant  for  it  to  visit. 
Like  the  sun  dispensing  light,  it  goes  its  daily  round. 

The  first  post  established  in  this  city,  was  in  1683 ;  when  Wil- 
liam Penn  granted  authority  to  Henry  Waldy  to  hold  one  from 
Philadelphia  to  New  Castle,  whence  it  connected  with  one  to 
Maryland.     This  post  went  once  per  week. 

In  1700,  an  act  was  passed  by  the  Assembly  for  the  esta- 
blishment of  a  post-office.  In  1753,  the  daily  delivery  of  letters 
in  the  city  by  carriers,  was  introduced.  In  the  following  year, 
a  mail  was  established,  three  times  a  week,  between  New  York

and  Philadelphia,  and  new  and  general  regulations  introduced 
for  the  carrying  of  the  mail  throughout  the  country ;  for  these 
improvements  we  are  indebted  to  Benjamin  Franklin,  the  then 
postmaster.  In  1775,  the  second  Congress  established  a  gene- 
ral post-office,  under  a  postmaster-general,  located  in  this  city ; 
Franklin  was  appointed  to  the  office,  with  a  salary  of  $1000 
per  annum.  The  communication  between  distant  places  at 
that  period  (yet  it  is  but  a  day  in  the  history  of  our  country), 
was  very  uncertain.  The  following  amusing  instance  will 
illustrate  the  slow  and  incorrect  manner  in  which  news  was 
then  transmitted,  and  shows  us,  by  an  extract  from  an  old 
newspaper  of  1777,  published  at  Nottingham,  England,  how 
much  in  actual  advance  we  are  of  the  "  good  old  times."  "  On 
November  the  8th,  news  was  received  in  this  town  of  the  total 
defeat  of  Washington's  army  in  America,  by  the  British  forces 
under  Sir  William  Howe,  on  Long  Island,  near  New  York.* 
Great  was  the  rejoicing  thereat;  the  church  bells  were  rung? 
the  people  met  in  crowds  in  the  streets,  and  congratulated  each 
other,  speeches  were  made,  guns  were  fired,  and  some  enthu- 
siastic spirits,  not  content  with  these  demonstrations,  procured 
a  donkey  and  sat  an  effigy  of  Washington  upon  it,  which  after 
being  paraded  about,  was  finally  burnt  with  great  triumph,  at 
night.  The  glorious  news  was  further  confirmed  this  morning 
by  a  letter  received  at  the  Duke  of  Newcastle's  house  at 
Clumber  Park."  We  wonder  if  an  extraordinary  gazette  ever 
arrived  with  a  full  confirmation  of  the  glorious  defeat  ? 

Since  the  Revolution,  great  changes  and  improvements  have 
been  introduced  into  this  national  establishment.  The  mind 
can  hardly  realize  the  vast  extent  of  its  operations ;  keeping 
up  communications,  as  it  does,  not  only  with  every  portion  of 
our  own  country,  but  with  the  whole  world.  From  its  centre 
at  Washington,  its  rays  diverge  in  all  directions. 

*  This  battle  was  fought  on  the  27th  of  August,  1776.

The  Branch  establishment  in  Philadelphia,  is  in  the  base- 
ment story  of  the  Exchange  Building,  Third  and  Dock  Streets. 
It  is  open  daily,  from  7  A.  M.  to  7  P.  M.,  and  two  hours  in  the 
morning  on  Sundays.  The  Eastern  mail  closes  at  3f  p.  M. ; 
the  Western  at  7  P.  M. ;  Southern  at  7  P.  M. ;  and  the  Northern 
at  5  o'clock  A.  M. 

The  officers  are  W.  J.  P.  White,  postmaster ;  J.  E.  Latta, 
chief  clerk ;  J.  C.  Montgomery,  superintendent,  assisted  by 
forty-five  clerks,  thirty-eight  carriers,  and  four  collectors. 

In  addition  to  the  usual  post-office  facilities,  Philadelphia 
possesses  the  advantage  of  the  most  complete  City  Post  in  this 
country.  Blood's  Despatch  Post,  conducted  by  Messrs.  Blood 
and  Kochersperger,  was  established  in  1845,  and  was  for  a  long 
time  considered  a  doubtful  experiment.  By  its  attention  to 
the  public  interest,  and  by  continued  improvement,  it  has  now 
become  a  necessary  convenience  to  business  men  and  families. 

Several  hundred  box  stations  are  scattered  over  the  city, 
from  which  letters  are  collected  every  two  hours;  and  thousands 
of  letters  are  thus  collected  and  distributed  daily.  Careful, 
intelligent  men  only  are  employed  as  carriers,  and  as  each 
letter  is  stamped  with  the  date  and  hour  of  delivery,  great 
promptness  and  reliability  are  obtained.

CHESTNUT  STREET  THEATRE. 


The  Chestnut  Street  Theatre  (in  Chestnut  above  Sixth 
Street),  in  point  of  architectural  beauty,  is  the  most  elegant  in 
the  city.  It  was  erected  from  designs  by  Wm.  Strickland,  in 
1822.  The  entrance  front  is  an  arcade,  supporting  a  screen  of 
Composite  columns,  flanked  by  two  wings,  in  which  are  niches 
containing  statues  of  Comedy  and  Tragedy  by  Rush.  Imme- 
diately below  these  are  semicircular  recesses,  with  basso-re- 
lievos representing  the  tragic  and  comic  Muses.

The  principal  approach  to  the  boxes  is  from  Chestnut  Street, 
through  an  arcade  of  five  entrances,  opening  into  a  vestibule, 
communicating  at  each  end  with  the  Box-office  and  the  Mana- 
ger's Room.  Screen  doors,  immediately  opposite,  and  corre- 
sponding to  the  entrance  of  the  arcade,  lead  from  the  vestibule 
into  spacious  lobbies,  from  whence  two  flights  of  ample  stair- 
ways conduct  to  the  second  and  third  floors,  and  to  a  splendid 
saloon  and  coffee-rooms  on  the  second  floor. 

The  audience  part  of  the  house  is  a  semicircle  of  45  feet 
in  diameter,  containing  three  rows  of  boxes,  resting  on  cast 
iron  columns,  and  secured  with  iron  sockets,  from  the 
foundation  to  the  dome;  the  whole  being  combined  laterally 
with  a  strong  wall,  bounding  the  lobbies  and  supporting  the 
roof.  The  dress  circle  of  the  boxes  is  on  a  line  with  the 
columns,  covered  with  a  canopy.  The  dome  is  46  feet  in 
diameter,  rising  6  feet  to  the  crown,  which  is  perforated  and 
formed  into  a  ventilator.     The  interior  is  richly  decorated. 

The  dimensions  of  the  building  are  90  by  150  feet.  Exclu- 
sive of  the  lobbies  it  will  accommodate  over  2000  persons;  and 
the  doorways,  which  open  outwards,  are  so  wide  and  numerous, 
as  to  discharge  the  most  crowded  audience  in  less  than  five 
minutes. 

Walnut  Street  Theatre,  corner  of  Walnut  and  Ninth 
Streets.  This  was  formerly  called  the  "  Olympic."  It  was  built 
in  1809,  as  a  Circus.  In  1828,  the  building  was  enlarged  and 
improved,  under  the  superintendence  of  Mr.  Haviland,  and  is 
now  the  most  fashionable  theatre  in  Philadelphia.  It  is  90 
feet  fronting  on  Walnut  Street,  and  146  feet  in  depth  on  Ninth 
Street. 

Arch  Street  Theatre  is  an  elegant  edifice,  situated  in 
Arch  Street  above  Sixth.  There  is  no  place  of  amusement  in 
this  city  where  the  public  are  better  catered  for,  or  where  the 
amusements  are  more  varied  than  at  the  "  Arch,"  novelties

Swaim's  Building,  situated  on  the  south-east  corner  of 
Chestnut  and  Seventh  Streets,  is  an  imposing  edifice,  of  recent 
construction.  It  is  in  the  Italian  or  Palladian  style  of  archi- 
tecture, with  a  red  sandstone  front.  This  material  was  obtained 
from  Thorn's  Quarries  on  the  Hudson  River. 

The  Chestnut  Street  facade  has  a  light  and  elegant  appear- 
ance. The  lower  story,  or  basement,  finishes  with  a  corri- 
dor, supported  on  an  order  of  antaes )  from  this  the  structure 
is  four  stories  to  the  heavy  cornice  of  consoles,  dentals,  scrolls, 
and  a  balustrade  of  good  proportions. 

There  are  two  entrances  to  the  establishment.  One  on 
Chestnut  Street,  which  is  the  principal,  and  one  on  Seventh 
Street.  The  second  story  is  devoted  to  "Barnuni's  wonders" 
in  art  and  nature. 

The  Lecture  Room  occupies  the  entire  upper  part  of  the 
building.     Gr.  P.  Cummings,  Esq.,  was  the  architect. 

Sansom  Street  Hall,  Sansom  Street  west  of  Sixth  Street, 
was  erected  in  1848,  under  the  direction  and  from  the  design  of 
Mr.  Cummings,  for  a  Public  Bath-house  and  Lyceum.  The 
front  is  a  mixture  of  Greek  and  Italian  architecture.  The  first 
story,  or  bath  entrance,  commences  with  an  order  from  the  baths 
of  Diocletian,  a  celebrated  structure  in  Rome ;  over  this  order, 
large  windows,  highly  enriched,  complete  the  facade  to  the  cor- 
nice, which  is  finished  in  corner  consoles,  blocking  courses,  &amp;c. 

The  bath-rooms  are  of  convenient  size  and  elegant  finish, 
furnished  with  hot  and  cold  water,  shower  douches,  &amp;c.  Two 
entrance  doors  lead  to  a  large  saloon,  100  by  45  feet,  with  an 
enriched  ceiling,  which,  with  the  walls,  is  beautifully  painted. 
The  upper  rooms  are  occupied  by  societies,  schools,  &amp;c.  Messrs.

Welch's  National  Theatre  and  Circus. — This  esta- 
blishment is  situated  in  Chestnut  Street  below  Ninth.  Its 
amusements  consist  of  equestrian  exercises  and  grand  specta- 
cles. Few  managers  are  more  liberal  in  their  endeavours  to 
please  the  public  than  Mr.  Lent,  the  present  Manager. 

Besides  the  Theatres,  there  are  several  large  and  splendid 
halls  for  exhibitions,  concerts,  balls,  &amp;c,  &amp;C,  among  which 
we  notice — 

The  Philadelphia  Museum  Building,  Ninth  and 
George  Streets.  This  is  an  immense  structure,  238  feet  long- 
by  70  feet  wide,  erected  for  the  exhibition  of  Peale's  Museum. 
The  lower  story  is  designated  "The  Chinese  Saloon,"  from 
being  occupied  by  Mr.  Dunn's  splendid  collection  of  Chinese 
curiosities,  previous  to  its  removal  to  Europe.  The  second 
story  is  "The  Museum,"  having  been  occupied  by  Pe ale's 
collection  until  sold.  The  Lecture  Boom,  on  George  Street, 
has  been  rendered  famous  by  the  exhibition  of  Signor  BlXtz's 
popular  and  striking  deceptions  in  legerdemain.  The  Signor' s 
sleight  of  hand  astonishes  the  illiterate  and  puzzles  the  in- 
telligent. 

The  Assembly  Building,  Tenth  and  Chestnut  Streets,  is 
a  substantial  and  oruamental  edifice. 

The  Franklin  Hall,  Sixth  Street  below  Arch,  contains  a 
large  and  elegant  room,  admirably  adapted  for  concerts,  lec- 
tures, &amp;c. 

The  Masonic  Hall,  Chestnut  below  Eighth  Street.  This 
large  and-  commodious  edifice  was  erected  for  the  accommoda- 
tion of  the  different  Masonic  Lodges  of  the  city,  in  1809,  and 
is  more  remarkable  for  size  than  beauty.  It  is  now  used  for 
balls,  exhibitions,  &amp;c,  &amp;c. 

The  Spring  Garden  Hall  contains  an  elegant  and  spa- 
cious room  for  public  assemblies.

The  Musical  Fund  Hall  is  situated  in  Locust  above 
Eighth  Street ;  it  presents  a  neat  and  appropriate  appearance. 

This  Institution  was  founded  February  29th,  1820,  having 
for  its  objects  the  relief  of  decayed  musicians  and  their  families, 
the  cultivation  of  skill,  and  the  diffusion  of  taste  in  music. 

The   present   building   was  erected   in  1824,  at  a  cost  of

27,500  dollars ;  since  that  time  various  improvements  have 
been  made,  the  most  important  of  which  was  in  1847,  when 
sixteen  feet  were  added  to  the  front,  making  a  saloon  of  123 
feet  in  length  and  60  feet  in  width,  giving  the  longest  ceiling 
in  the  country  without  being  supported  by  columns. 

It  has  a  temporary  orchestra  on  the  south  end,  sufficient  for 
the  accommodation  of  150  performers.  The  saloon  will  seat 
2000  persons.  This  hall,  in  regard  to  its  musical  effects,  stands 
unrivalled. 

The  lower  story  contains  a  supper-room,  library  of  music, 
a  suite  of  dressing-rooms,  and  the  superintendent's  office.  There 
are  at  present  connected  with  it  about  60  life  members,  60 
professional  musicians,  and  nearly  300  annual  subscribers. 

The  Musical  Fund  Hall  is  a  favourite  with  our  citizens,  being 
occupied  nearly  the  whole  business  season,  for  concerts,  balls, 
lectures,  and  singing-schools.  Its  central  location  and  quiet 
neighbourhood  add  greatly  to  its  advantages.  The  superinten- 
dent of  the  Hall,  Mr.  Thomas  J.  Becket,  is  at  all  times  on 
or  near  the  premises,  and  takes  much  pleasure  in  giving  infor- 
mation, or  exhibiting  this  really  elegant  building. 

PUBLIC   SQUARES. 

Independence  Square,  formerly  called  the  State  House 
Yard.  This  is  a  beautiful  and  favourite  promenade.  The 
Declaration  of  Independence  was  first  publicly  read  in  this 
Square,  by  Captain  Hopkins,  of  the  Navy,  July  8th,  1776  : 
hence  the  name. 

Those  handsome  buildings  on  Walnut  Street,  facing  this 
Square,  and  on  Sixth  Street,  facing  the  Washington  Square, 
occupy  the  site  of  the  "  Old  Prison."  During  the  Revolution, 
it  was  the  "  British  Provost,"  and  at  one  time  they  had  within 
its  gloomy  walls  over  900  American  prisoners,  under  the 
charge  of  the   ever-infamous   Captain  Cunningham.      These

brave  men  were  principally  those  captured  at  the  battles  of 
Brandywine  and  Germantown.  Many  of  them  died  there  of 
hunger  and  cold :  their  sufferings  as  related  by  eye-witnesses 
were  most  heartrending.     Crossing  over  Sixth  Street,  we  enter 

Washington  Square. — This  is  a  most  delightful  spot,  re- 
joicing in  almost  perpetual  verdure;  it  is  also  planted  with  a 
great  variety  of  beautiful  trees,  shrubs,  and  plants.  Here  bloom 
alike  the  towering  oak,  the  lordly  pine,  the  weeping  willow, 
the  fragrant  almond  and  magnolia.  It  is  a  lovely  picture,  in 
the  summer,  to  see  this  Square  animated  and  enlivened  by  the 
fair  and  gentle, — by  the  clear,  sweet  voice  of  childhood,  min- 
gling with  the  song  of  the  numerous  birds,  as  happy  and  as 
innocent  as  themselves.  In  olden  time,  this  was  the  "  Potters' 
Field,"  overgrown  with  weeds  and  brambles ;  the  place  where 
the  stranger  and  the  friendless  found  a  last  resting-place. 
During  the^  war  of  Independence,  upwards  of  two  thousand 
soldiers  of  the  American  Army,  who  had  died  from  the  effects 
of  their  wounds,  or  the  camp  fever,  were  buried  in  it;  the  ashes 
of  these  brave  fellows  lie  on  the  line  of  Walnut  by  Seventh 
Street.  John  Adams  says  in  a  letter,  "  I  have  spent  an  hour 
this  morning  in  the  congregation  of  the  dead.  I  took  a  walk 
into  the  Potters'  Field ;  and  I  never  in  my  life  was  so  affected 
with  melancholy ;  the  graves  of  our  soldiers,  who  have  been 
buried  during  the  last  summer  and  winter,  are  enough  to  make 
the  heart  of  stone  melt  away.  The  sexton  told  me  that 
upwards  of  two  thousand  soldiers  have  been  buried  here )  and, 
by  the  appearance  of  the  graves  and  trenches,  it  is  probable  to 
me  that  he  speaks  within  bounds." 

It  was  last  used  for  this  purpose  during  the  prevalence  of 
yellow  fever  in  1793,  and  was  finally  closed  as  a  place  of  in- 
terment in  1795.  It  was  laid  out  as  a  public  square  in  1815. 
It  is  proposed  to  erect  a  monument  to  Washington  in  the  centre 
plot.    When  is  it  to  be  done  ?    Philadelphians,  look  at  Bunker

Hill  monument !  New  England  is  true  to  the  memory  of  the 
brave ;  let  it  no  longer  be  said  that  the  remains  of  over  two 
thousand  of  the  soldiers  of  the  Revolution  lie  in  your  most 
beautiful  Square,  their  graves  unnoticed — nay,  in  a  great 
measure,  forgotten. 

Franklin  Square, — situated  between  Race  and  Vine 
Streets,  and  Sixth  and  Franklin  Streets.  This  is  a  noble 
Square,  beautifully  shaded  with  trees  and  shrubbery ;  it  is  laid 
out  with  great  taste,  and  kept  in  good  order.  In  the  centre 
is  a  splendid  fountain,  with  forty  jets  of  water,  enclosed  by  an 
ornamented  iron  railing. — The  Franklin  Square  is  a  favourite 
place  of  resort  of  thousands  of  our  citizens  during  the  warm 
days  of  summer. 

The  Penn  Squares,  Broad  and  Market  Streets,  will  soon 
become  highly  ornamental,  having  been  neatly  laid  out  and 
planted  with  choice  trees.  This  was  formerly  the  site  of  the 
"Old  Water-works."  The  vicinity  in  this  neighbourhood  has 
much  improved  of  late  years ;  where  once  the  unsightly  Arch 
Street  Prison  stood,  are  now  spacious  and  elegant  residences. 

Rittenhouse  Square,  is  located  in  the  southwestern 
section  of  the  city,  and 

Logan  Square,  in  the  northwestern  part.  All  these 
Squares  are  well  lighted  at  night  with  numerous  gas  lamps,  and 
are  provided  with  seats  for  the  accommodation  of  the  public; 
the  grass,  trees,  &amp;c,  are  frequently  cut  and  trimmed,  and  the 
walks  well  rolled  and  kept  clean. 

In  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  two  last  named,  some  of 
the  most  elegant  private  residences  in  the  city  are  situated. 

Besides  the  above  squares  in  the  city,  there  are  Fairhill 
Square  and  Norris's  Square  in  Kensington,  not  yet  laid  out, 
though  it  is  designed  they  shall  be  at  an  early  date.

COMMERCIAL   INSTITUTIONS. 

The  Merchants'  Exchange  is  a  magnificent  building, 
fronting  on  Walnut,  Dock,  and  Third  Streets.  It  is  con- 
structed of  the  purest  Pennsylvania  marble,  from  a  design 
of  W.  Strickland,  Esq.  It  forms  a  parallelogram,  the 
eastern  front  being  circular,  embellished  with  a  portico  re- 
cessed, supported  by  Corinthian  columns,  standing  on  a  base- 
ment, which  being  richly  ornamented  with  sculpture,  gives  a 
stately  air  to  the  building  as  viewed  from  Dock  Street.  It  is 
three  stories  high,  the  lower  one  being  occupied  by  the  Post- 
Office,  on  the  north,  the  Delaware  Mutual  Safety  Insurance 
Company,  on  the  northwest,  and  the  Union  Mutual  Insurance 
Company,  on  the  southwest  corner.  The  first  named  Company 
have  a  beautifully  executed  engraving  of  this  building  as 
viewed  from  Dock  below  Third  Street.  The  Merchants' 
Heading  Room,  in  the  splendid  rotunda  on  the  second  story, 
is  ornamented  with  designs  in  fresco ;  the  floor  is  inlaid  in 
Mosaic  work.  A  superb  view  of  the  lower  part  of  the  city, 
the  River  Delaware,  &amp;c,  is  obtained  from  the  cupola.  The 
remainder  of  the  building  is  rented  for  commercial  offices,  &amp;c. 
The  entrance  from  Dock  Street  is  by  semicircular  flights  of 
marble  steps,  on  the  north  and  south  sides,  both  of  which  are 
ornamented  by  two  gigantic  lions,  exquisitely  cut  in  marble. 
The  vicinity  of  the  Exchange  is  one  of  the  most  enlivening 
in  the  city.

The  officers  of  the  Board  consist  of  a  president,  two  vice- 
presidents,  treasurer,  secretary,  and  a  board  of  twenty-one 
directors. 

The  object  of  the  Board  of  Trade,  is  to  make  the  association 
a  point  of  practical  union  among  the  business  men  of  Phila- 
delphia, where  suggestions  can  profitably  be  exchanged  for  the 
promotion  of  local  interests,  and  where  harmony  of  action  can 
be  secured  by  the  contact  of  intelligence  and  experience. 

BANKS. 

The  Banks  of  Philadelphia  may  with  propriety  be  num- 
bered among  the  public  buildings ;  and,  taken  as  a  whole,  are 
certainly  more  beautiful  as  specimens  of  architecture,  than 
those  of  any  other  city  in  this  country. 

The  first  of  these  institutions  which  we  notice,  is  the  Bank 
of  North  America,  the  first  established  in  the  United  States ; 
being  founded  in  view  of  the  depressed  state  of  the  public 
finances,  by  Congress,  in  December,  1781.  It  is  believed  that 
this  establishment,  together  with  the  exertions  of  Robert 
Morris,  one  of  its  principal  originators,  saved  the  treasury 
from  bankruptcy,  and  was  eventually  the  restorer  of  sound 
credit,  and  a  good  circulating  medium.  An  additional  act  of 
incorporation  was  passed  by  the  Legislature  of  Pennsylvania, 
in  1782.  This  was,  however,  repealed  in  1785.  In  1787,  a 
new  charter  was  granted,  which  has  subsequently  been  re- 
newed.    Capital  stock,  81,000,000. 

The  present  banking-house,  situated  on  the  north  side  of 
Chestnut  Street,  between  Third  and  Fourth  Streets,  is  an  elegant 
building,  constructed  of  brown  stone,  presenting  to  our  city  a 
fine  example  of  the  Florentine  style  of  architecture. 

Mr.  Watson,  in  his  annals  of  Philadelphia,  tells  us  that 
this  bank  commenced  its  career  with  "coin  sent  out  from 
France,  at  the  instance  of  Robert  Morris,  by  M.  De  Chaumont :

building,  roughcast.  It  was  the  residence  of  Admiral  Howe 
during  the  occupancy  of  the  city  by  the  British,  in  1777-78. 

The  Mechanics'  Bank  was  chartered  in  the  year  1814, 
with  a  capital  of  $1,400,000.  Its  banking-house  is  a  neat  and 
graceful  edifice,  located  in  Third  below  Market  Street.

The  Bank  of  Pennsylvania,  Second  below  Chestnut 
Street,  was  chartered  in  the  year  1793,  with  a  capital  of 
$2,500,000.  The  banking-house  of  this  institution  is  one  of 
the  most  beautiful  specimens  of  Grecian  architecture  in  this 
country.  The  building  is  constructed  of  Pennsylvania  marble. 
It  is  designed  from  the  Temple  of  the  Muses,  near  Athens ; 
with  two  porticos,  of  six  Ionic  columns  each.  The  principal 
room  is  lighted  from  an  elegant  dome,  which,  together  with 
the  entire  roof,  is  covered  with  marble.  The  stockholders' 
chamber  opens  upon  a  beautiful  area,  facing  the  west,  orna- 
mented with  trees,  shrubs,  flowers,  and  fountains,  enclosed 
from  the  street  by  a  tasteful  iron  railing.  The  corner  stone  of 
this  classic  edifice  was  laid  in  April,  1799,  and  the  structure 
completed  in  1801.

PHILADELPHIA     BANK. 


The  Philadelphia  Bank,  a  substantial  and  imposing- 
marble  building,  on  the  southwest  corner  of  Chestnut  and 
Fourth  Streets,  was  chartered  in  1804,  with  a  capital  stock  of 
$2,000,000.  The  front  of  this  structure  consists  of  an  elegant 
portico,  of  the  Corinthian  order,  resting  on  a  basement  flanked 
by  wings.  The  counting-room  of  the  institution  is  in  the  east 
wing,  which  is  approached  by  a  flight  of  marble  steps, 
ascending  from  Chestnut  Street,  adjoining  the  portico.  The 
basement  is  fitted  up  into  spacious  stores,  the  westernmost 
one  of  which  is  occupied  by  the  Girard  Life  Insurance 
Company. 

The  Western  Bank  occupies  the  west  wing  of  the  Phila- 
delphia Bank  building,  Chestnut  and  Fourth  Streets.  This 
banking  establishment  was  chartered  in  the  year  1832,  with  a 
capital  of  $100,000.

UNION  STEAMSHIP  COMPANY'S  LINE, 

BETWEEN  PHILADELPHIA  AND  NORFOLK, 
PETERSBURG,  AND  RICHMOND,  VA. 

This  Company  would  respectfully  call  the  attention  of  the  public 
to  their  new  Packet  Line  of  First  Class  Steamships,  now  in  successful 
operation  between  the  above-named  ports,  one  of  the  Ships  leaving 
each  port  every  five  days.  The  Virginia,  David  Teal,  Master,  and 
Pennsylvania,  J.  E.  Walton,  Master,  composing  the  line,  have  been 
built  and  fitted  up  expressly  for  this  trade,  and  no  pains  or  expense 
has  been  spared  in  their  construction.  They  are  fast  ships,  hand- 
somely fitted  up  for  passengers,  each  carrying  two  of  Francis's  Metallic 
Life  Boats.  The  Captains  are  men  of  high  standing  in  their  calling, 
and  the  Company  are  careful  in  selecting  experienced  engineers. 
This  line  of  Steamships  has  long  been  needed,  and  now  offers  by  far 
the  most  desirable,  safe,  and  economical  mode  of  transit,  both  for 
passengers  and  goods,  between  the  ports.  By  this  line,  all  tranship- 
ments are  avoided,  and  all  the  delays  and  damages  consequent  there- 
upon, the  goods  and  passengers  being  carried  direct  to  the  ports  of 
destination.  It  offers,  also,  a  new  and  interesting  trip  to  passengers, 
giving  them  twelve  to  fourteen  hours  at  sea,  with  the  beautiful 
scenery  of  James  River,  as  well  as  the  Delaware.  The  Company 
confidently  hope  their  efforts  in  establishing  this  important  line  will 
be  appreciated  by  the  travelling  and  business  community. 

N.  B.  A  third  Ship  will  be  placed  on  the  line  during  the  coming 
year,  when  it  is  expected  they  will  sail  twice  a  week  from  each  port.

GIRARD     BANK. 


The  Girard  Bank,  Third  opposite  Dock  Street.  This 
stately  edifice  was  built  originally  for  the  first  United  States 
Bank ;  subsequently  it  was  occupied  by  the  wealthy  individual 
whose  name  it  bears,  as  his  banking-house.  Here,  from  early 
morning  until  3  o'clock,  p.  m.,  he  transacted  in  person  his 
extensive  concerns  as  a  banker,  and  instructed  and  received 
reports  from  his  numerous  agents  and  captains  of  his  vessels. 
After  banking  hours  he  retired  to  his  farm,  where  he  enjoyed 
the  pleasure  of  rural  employments  until  the  evening,  when  he 
again  returned  to  his  bank,  where  the  midnight  hour  found 
him  examining  and  scrutinizing  the  accounts  of  his  clerks 
with  a  keenness  of  inspection  peculiar  to  himself.  In  the  study 
of  Girard's  history  we  cease  to  wonder  at  his  magical  success. 
His  secret  lay  in  the  patient  application  of  a  sagacious  mind 
to  the  single  object  of  accumulation.  It  is  in  vain  to  say,  that 
with  some,  all  things  seem  to  prosper,  while  beneath  the  touch

of  others  everything  withers  and  dies.  The  secret  of  success, 
so  well  understood  by  this  remarkable  man,  is  not  so  very 
difficult  to  solve  after  all;  it  lies  in  a  word,  and  that  is,  Perse-

The  present  Bank  was  chartered  in  the  year  1832,  with 
a  capital  of  $5,000,000.  In  1847,  it  was  re-chartered,  with  a 
reduced  capital, — $1,250,000. 

The  Bank  of  the  Northern  Liberties,  stands  on  the

The  present  banking-house  of  this  institution,  located  in  Chest- 
nut west  of  Second  Street,  is  constructed  of  brown  stone.  In 
the  design  of  this  building,  the  architect,  the  late  Mr.  Johnson, 
has  evidently  studied  utility  more  than  display ;  yet  the  genius 
of  the  true  artist  manifests  itself  throughout,  and  few  of  our

Western  Saving  Fund  Association,  313  Chestnut,  west

London  paper,  "  a  very  handsome  Temperance  Hall,  built  out 
of  penny  subscriptions,  with  the  motto  cut  in  stone : 

" '  Wise  pennies  bought  it. 

Who  would  have  thought  it!' " 

True  enough,  who  would  have  thought  it?  yet  this  started  in 
the  mind  of  "  a  canny  Scot," — the  idea  of  Penny  Savings  Banks, 
which  have  since  been  eminently  successful.  In  one  city,  with  a 
population  of  40,000  inhabitants,  no  less  than  5,000  have  made 
deposits,  which  during  six  months  amounted  to  over  85,000, or 
an  average  of  over  one  dollar  each.  As  will  be  readily  sup- 
posed, these  deposits  belong  to  a  class  which  heretofore  never 
aspired  to  the  thought  of  an  ordinary  Savings  Bank,  with  its 
comparatively  speaking  high  scale  of  deposits.  They  are  open 
every  evening  for  the  receipt  of  the  smallest  sums.  Consider 
this  subject,  citizens  of  Philadelphia.  Think  of  the  advantage 
of  having  converted  the  eighth  part  of  an  entire  town  popula- 
tion into  habits  of  self-denial  and  frugality;  of  giving  to  so  many 
persons,  a  stake  in  the  country,  a  stake  not  small  to  them ; —

In  this  Company  every  dollar  received  is  appropriated,  after  pay-

losses ;  and  cannot  be  used  for  any  other  purpose  (except  the  interest 
on  the  dividends  declared)  until  the  accumulated  capital  of  the  Com- 
pany amounts  to  $400,000,  when,  if  the  assets  of  the  Company  ex- 
ceed the  value  of  all  the  policies  in  force,  the  first  dividend  declared 
may  be  paid  off,  and  so  on  year  by  year  as  the  situation  of  the  Com- 
pany may  warrant;  but  no  dividend  can  be  paid  off  until  the  assets 
of  the  Company  excel  the  value  of  all  the  policies  in  force,  an  amount

and  you  cannot  view  the  result  as  otherwise  than  important. 
We  think  this  excellent  system  might  be  introduced  into  this

PEXN    BUILDING. 


Penn  Mutual  Life  Insurance  Company's  Office. — 
This  building,  constructed  during  the  last  year,  presents  a  point 
of  much  interest  in  the  thoroughfare  where  it  is  placed,  from  its 
decided  beauty  and  originality.  It  is  entirely  of  cast  iron,  and 
was  the  first  building  of  this  material  erected  in  Philadelphia. 
The  first  story  is  a  series  of  semi-octagons,  supporting  an  order 
highly  enriched.  Over  the  front  entrance,  resting  on  an  orna- 
mented dais,  is  a  cast  iron  statue  of  William  Penn,  weighing 
six   hundred   pounds.      Arcades  of  beautiful   windows,    rise

above  this  point  to  the  fourth  story,  which  terminates  with  a 
highly-decorated  cornice,  supported  by  consoles,  &amp;c.  Above 
this,  is  the  fifth  story,  which  forms  an  appropriate  finish  to 
the  whole  edifice. 

The  mode  of  construction  is  dissimilar  to  any  iron  building 
in  this  country  or  Europe,  many  of  the  plates  being  not  over 
one-fourth  of  an  inch  thick,  and  none  over  half  an  inch;  the 
whole  space  occupied  by  the  wall  being  less  than  seven  inches. 
These  plates  are  jointed  and  bolted  together  in  a  novel  method, 
highly  creditable  to  the  skill  of  the  contractor,  Mr.  J.  Sin- 
GERLY,  who  has  carefully  carried  out  a  design,  improved  by 
the  patient  effort  of  the  architect,  Mr.  J.  B.  Cummings,  to 
construct  an  iron  building  without  waste  of  material. 

The  style  of  architecture  is  the  modern  or  florid  Italian. 
Besides  the  principal  entrance  on  Third  Street,  there  is  an  ad- 
ditional one  on  Dock  Street,  leading  to  the  upper  stories. 

The  Company's  office  is  elaborately  finished,  and  the  fur- 
niture is  of  the  most  tasteful  and  substantial  character. 

The  neighbourhood  of  this  interesting  edifice  abounds  in 
public  buildings,  offices,  &amp;c.  On  the  opposite  side  of  Third 
Street  stands  the  Girard  Bank,  and  facing  the  south  front 
is  the  Merchants'  Exchange,  in  which  the  stranger  will  find 
the  Post-Office,  Commercial  Reading-rooms,  the  apartments  of 
the  Board  of  Trade,  the  Board  of  Brokers,  together  with  several 
Insurance  Offices,  &amp;c.  In  Walnut  Street,  below  Third,  is 
situated  the  Farquhar  Building,  at  once  chaste  and  ornamental, 
while  to  the  east  of  the  Exchange  is  seen  the  Pennsylvania 
Bank.  This  latter  structure,  as  viewed  from  Dock  Street, 
forms  an  object  of  much  attraction.  This  vicinity  is  also  the 
starting-point  for  omnibuses  running  to  the  various  parts  of 
the  city  and  adjoining  districts.

Capital  and  premiums  liable  for  loss,  is  over  §250,000,  and  con- 
stantly increasing. 

Premium  payments  can  be  made  with  reference  to  the  convenience 
of  parties  opening  policies  with  the  Company. 

Policies  will  be  issued  for  the  benefit  of  married  women  and  chil- 
dren, free  from  the  claims  of  the  representatives  of  her  husband,  or 
of  any  of  his  creditors. 

jgggr'  Policies  may  be  assigned  without  the  knowledge  of  the  Com- 
pany. 

Jg^0  No  policy  shall  be  vitiated  through  error  merely,  unless  there 
existed  at  the  time  a  fraudulent  intention. 

$S^  The  original  amount  of  policies  will  be  reduced  at  any  time, 
to  suit  the  pleasure  of  insured  parties. 

Jgg^  Policies  of  two  or  more  years'  standing  will  be  purchased  upon 
surrender. 

J$@Q&gt;  Policies  with  the  profits,  forfeited  by  non-payment  of  pre- 
miums, may  be  renewed  at  any  time  by  the  payment  of  arrears,  with 
interest;  provided  the  health  of  the  party  at  the  time  is  unimpaired. 

The  liberality  of  the  travelling  license  is  peculiar  to  this  Company, 
permission  being  granted  to  cross  the  Atlantic,  at  any  season  of  the 
year,  in  first-class  steamers  or  sailing  packets,  free  of  extra  charge. 

The  object  aimed  at  by  this  institution  is  stability  and  perpetuity. 
The  rates  of  premium  have  been  carefully  prepared  with  reference  to 
fluctuations.  The  first  object  of  the  plan  presented  is  to  make  cer- 
tain provision  to  meet  the  first  motive  to  insure,  and  which  considera- 
tion should  be  paramount  to  all  others,  viz.,  the  prompt  payment  of 
losses  as  they  occur;  after  which,  to  make  such  additions  of  profits 
to  the  policy  as  the  progressive  gains  of  the  Company  will  justify,  or 
pay  such  gains  to  its  members  in  cash  on  demand. 

The  plan  of  operations  adopted  and  practised  by  this  Company  is 
quite  as  valuable  to  the  insured  as  it  is  popular  with  the  public.

CHAPTER   IV. 

EDUCATION. 


UNIVERSITY  OF  PENNSYLVANIA. 

The  University  of  Pennsylvania,  Ninth  Street  below 
Market,  was  established  in  1750  as  a  charity  school  and  an 
academy,  through  the  exertions  of  a  few  public-spirited  indi- 
viduals, among  whom  Dr.  Franklin  was  prominent, — chartered 
and  endowed  in  1750,  erected  into  a  college  in  1755,  and  into 
a  University  in  1779. 

The  building  first  occupied  by  this  school,  was  that  known  as 
"The  Old  Academy/'  in  Fourth  below  Arch  Street,  originally 
built  as  a  meeting-house  by  the  friends  of  the  Rev.  Gr.  Whit- 
field.    This  society,  in  disposing  of  the  premises,  reserved  the

right  of  a  meeting  hall  in  it  for  ever,  for  the  use  of  itinerant 
preachers.  Within  the  past  two  years  this  old  and  celebrated 
edifice  has  been  removed,  and  a  new  and  elegant  structure  of 
brick  erected  on  its  site.  It  is  still  a  school  attached  to  the 
University. 

In  1798,  the  trustees  purchased  from  the  State,  the  Presi- 
dent's House,  built  for  the  accommodation  of  the  President 
of  the  United  States.  This  spacious  building,  three  stories  high 
and  100  feet  square,  enlarged  in  1807  for  the  convenience  of 
the  Medical  Department,  was  taken  down  in  1828,  when  the 
present  ones  were  erected.  They  are  each  85  feet  front,  by 
112  deep,  surrounded  by  an  open  area,  separated  from  the 
street  by  a  neat  and  substantial  iron  railing. 

This  Institution  comprises  four  departments,  viz.,  the 
academical,  the  collegiate,  the  medical,  and  the  law.  The  pro- 
fessors are  of  the  highest  standing  in  the  various  departments, 
and  the  school  ranks  second  to  none. 

The  Faculty  consists  of  a  Provost  and  a  Vice-Provost,  a 
Professor  of  Moral  Philosophy,  a  Professor  of  Mathematics, 
an  Emeritus  Professor  of  the  Greek  and  Latin  Languages,  a 
Professor  of  Rhetoric  and  English  Literature,  a  Professor  of 
Natural  Philosophy  and  Chemistry,  and  a  Professor  of  the 
Greek  and  Latin  Languages. 

Besides  these,  there  is  a  Professor  of  French,  for  voluntary 
classes  in  that  language;  and  Professors  of  American  History; 
of  Chemistry  applied  to  the  Arts;  and  of  Natural  History, — by 
whom  Lectures  are  occasionally  given. 

The  college  year  extends  from  the  eighth  day  of  September, 
to  the  third  day  of  July  (in  which  month  the  Commencement 
is  held),  with  two  vacations  of  one  week  each  at  Christmas,  and 
at  the  beginning  of  April.     Tuition,  $75  a  year. 

The  catalogue  of  the  last  college  year  contains  the  names  of 
ninety-five  students.

GIRARD    COLLEGE.  119 

The  Law  Department  was  instituted  in  1850.  The  course 
consists  of  two  terms,  of  six  months  each,  commencing  on  the 
first  Monday  in  November,  each  year. 

G-irard  College  (See  Frontispiece). — This  really  mag- 
nificent College  is  situated  on  the  Ridge  Road,  about  a  mile 
from  the  incorporated  limits  of  the  City.  It  was  founded  by 
Stephen  G-irard,  and  is  designed  for  the  gratuitous  instruc- 
tion and  support  of  destitute  orphans.  Mr.  Girard  was  a 
native  of  France,  having  emigrated  to  this  country  at  an 
early  age  and  settled  in  Philadelphia,  where,  by  unwearied 
industry  and  judicious  management,  he  accumulated  a  noble 
fortune,  the  larger  portion  of  which  he  bequeathed  to  the  city 
of  Philadelphia  for  the  erection  and  support  of  this  institution, 
and  improving  the  city. 

This  College  is  one  of  the  most  beautiful  structures  of 
modern  times,  as  a  work  of  art  alone,  and  a  monument  of 
private  munificence  to  the  cause  of  education  such  as  few 
countries  in  the  world  possess. 

The  corner-stone  was  laid  on  the  4th  of  July,  1833,  the 
buildings  were  completed  in  1847,  and  the  Institution  went 
into  operation  on  the  1st  of  January,  1848. 

The  general  design  of  the  main  building  is  that  of  a  Greek 
temple ;  having  eight  columns  on  each  end,  and  eleven  on  each 
side,  including  the  corner  columns  both  ways. 

The  superstructure  rests  on  a  stylobate  or  basement,  con- 
sisting of  eleven  steps,  which  extend  around  the  entire  edifice, 
thus  imparting  a  pyramidal  appearance  to  the  superstructure, 
which  conveys  an  idea  of  great  solidity,  and  at  the  same  time 
affords  an  approach  to  the  peristyle  from  all  sides. 

The  order  of  architecture  in  which  the  exterior  is  composed, 
is  the  Corinthian :  the  columns  are  6  feet  in  diameter,  and 
55  feet  in  height ;  the  bases  are  9  feet  3  inches  in  diameter, 
and  3  feet  2  inches  high;  the  capitals  are  8  feet  6  inches  high,

and  9  feet  4  inches  wide  on  the  face  of  the  abacus.  The  corner 
columns  have  1^  inches  more  diameter  than  the  intermediate 
ones,  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  the  apparent  reduction  in 
their  size,  arising  from  their  insulated  position. 

The  shafts  are  composed  of  fruster,  measuring  from  2  feet  6 
inches  to  6  feet  3  inches  in  height,  accurately  jointed,  and  set 
on  milled  lead ;  each  shaft  is  channeled  in  24  semicircular 
flutes,  with  fillets  terminating  under  the  capital  in  water  leaves. 

The  capitals  are  each  constructed  in  four  courses ; — the  first, 
consisting  of  a  single  piece,  1  foot  7  inches  in  height,  embracing 
an  annular  row  of  sixteen  water  leaves;  the  second,  likewise 
composed  of  a  single  block,  measuring  33  inches  in  height,  con- 
tains an  annular  row  of  eight  acanthus  leaves ;  the  third  con- 
sists of  two  pieces,  with  a  vertical  joint  running  through  the 
middle,  measuring  35  inches  in  height,  and  embraces  the  vo- 
lutes and  the  cauliculi;  the  fourth  constitutes  the  abacus,  the 
height  of  which  is  15  inches  :  this  course  is  composed  of  four 
pieces,  the  vertical  joints  being  hid  by  honeysuckles  dovetailed 
into  the  bell,  thus  making  each  capital  to  consist  of  twelve 
separate  pieces,  all  securely  dowelled  and  cramped  together, 
and  the  joints  so  disposed  as  not  to  be  observed. 

The  architrave  over  each  intercolumniation  consists  of  four 
blocks  of  marble,  21  feet  5  inches  in  length,  4  feet  2  inches 
in  height,  and  1  foot  4£  inches  in  thickness,  extending  from 
column  to  column. 

The  cornice  consists  of  congeries  of  mouldings,  enriched  with 
a  dentil  band,  and  crowned  with  a  sculptured  cymatium  of  2 
feet  4  inches  in  height.  The  extreme  projection  of  the  cornice 
from  the  face  of  the  architrave  is  4  feet,  and  its  height  7  feet  6 
inches.  The  whole  height  of  the  entablature  is  16  feet  4  inches, 
and  of  the  pediment,  from  the  top  of  the  cymatium,  17  feet  8 
inches,  making  the  height  from  the  top  of  the  columns  to  the 
apex  of  the  pediment,  34  feet.

The  cella  or  body  of  the  building  is  111  feet  wide,  by  169 
feet  long,  and  56  feet  8  inches  high,  including  the  architrave, 
which  corresponds  with  that  of  the  peristyle.  The  corners  of 
cella  are  finished  with  projecting  antae  of  5  feet  6  inches  in  the 
width,  having  bases  to  correspond  with  those  of  the  columns. 

The  doors  of  entrance  are  in  the  north  and  south  fronts; 
each  door  measures  16  feet  wide  and  32  feet  high,  in  the  clear, 
trimmed  on  the  outside  with  moulded  antepagmenta  of  2  feet 
7  inches  in  width,  and  crowned  with  a  projecting  cornice  sup- 
ported by  richly-carved  consoles. 

Each  flank  is  pierced  with  twenty  windows,  four  of  which 
open  into  each  room,  and  one  on  each  flight  of  stairs;  those 
which  open  into  the  rooms,  are  grouped  and  divided  by  Greek 
antae,  surmounted  by  architraves  and  cornices. 

The  roof  is  composed  of  marble  tiles,  four  and  a  half  feet 
long,  four  feet  wide,  and  three-fourths  inches  thick  in  the  mid- 
dle, the  sides  being  elevated  an  inch  and  a  half  above  the 
general  surface,  to  prevent  the  water  running  into  the  joints; 
each  of  these  joints  is  covered  with  a  marble  saddle,  hollowed 
out  on  the  inner  side,  so  as  to  embrace  the  ridges  on  the 
two  adjacent  tiles.  The  weight  of  each  of  these  tiles  is  776  lbs., 
and  of  each  saddle  214  lbs.,  the  whole  number  of  tiles  is  2064, 
and  of  saddles  2061 ;  the  aggregate  weight  of  the  tiles  and 
saddles  is  906  tons ;  in  addition  to  which,  the  marble  chimney- 
tops,  and  cast  iron  skylights,  weigh  20  tons,  and  the  lead,  &amp;c, 
of  the  gutters,  43  £  tons;  making  the  entire  weight  of  the  roof, 
exclusive  of  the  brick-work  which  supports  it,  969 1  tons!  The 
skylights  are  of  cast  iron  tiles  and  saddles,  so  formed  as  to  pre- 
sent an  appearance,  corresponding  to  the  rest  of  the  roof;  in 
the  centre  of  each  tile  two  lights  of  glass  are  inserted,  measur- 
ing 19  inches  in  width,  42  in  length,  and  half  an  inch  in  thick- 
ness. 

The  building  is  three  stories  high,  the  first  and  second  being

25  feet  from  floor  to  floor,  and  the  third  story  30  feet  in  the 
clear  to  the  eye  of  the  dome ;  each  story  is  divided  into  four 
rooms,  each  50  feet  square,  and  vestibules. 

The  vestibules  in  the  first  story,  and  the  lobbies  over  them 
in  the  second  and  third  stories,  occupy  the  northern  and  south- 
ern ends  of  the  building ;  they  are  each  25  by  50  feet,  exclu- 
sive of  the  space  occupied  by  the  stairways.  The  vaulting  of 
each  vestibule  and  lobby,  springs  from  marble  entablatures, 
supported  by  eight  columns  and  as  many  antae.  The  shafts  of 
these  columns  are  each  composed  of  a  single  piece ;  the  order 
of  those  in  the  first  story  is  Ionic,  in  the  second,  a  modified 
Corinthian,  from  the  Tower  of  the  Winds  at  Athens,  and  the 
third,  a  similar  style,  only  somewhat  lighter  and  more  ornate. 

All  the  rooms  and  vestibules  are  vaulted  with  bricks ;  those 
of  the  basement,  first  and  second  stories,  with  groin  arches,  and 
those  of  the  third  story,  with  pendentive  domes  springing  from 
the  floor,  the  horizontal  or  springing  line  being  four  feet  square, 
with  bands.  These  bands  form  semicircular  arches  on  the 
four  walls  of  each  room,  and  from  their  angles  at  the  floor, 
spring  the  pendentives.  The  horizontal  section  of  each  room 
is  thus  resolved  into  a  circle  at  the  top  of  the  bands,  and 
crowned  with  a  dome;  the  dome,  as  well  as  the  pendentive 
and  bands,  is  enriched  with  deep  cofferings,  and  the  eye  of 
the  dome  is  finished  with  an  ornamental  fret,  and  covered 
with  an  inner  skylight  of  16  feet  in  diameter.  The  stairways 
are  situated  in  the  four  corners  of  the  building;  they  are  all 
composed  of  white  marble,  and  are  five  feet  three  inches  in 
width,  with  two  landings  or  quarter  paces  in  each  story ;  they 
arc  constructed  on  the  "  geometrical  plan."  All  these  stairways 
and  landings  are  finished  with  rich  balustrades  of  cast  iron, 
and  mahogany  rails,  springing  from  massy  marble  newels. 
The  dome  over  the  stairways  is  similar  in  construction  to  those 

in  the  rooms.

The  outbuildings  are  each  52  feet  by  125  feet  long,  and 
three  stories  high,  with  a  basement  7  feet  above  the  surface  of 
the  ground;  they  are  all  faced  with  marble  and  roofed  with 
copper. 

The  easternmost  building  embraces  four  separate  and  com- 
plete dwelling-houses,  for  the  officers  of  the  Institution.  The 
others  are  fitted  up  for  the  accommodation  of  the  pupils,  their 
tutors,  governesses,  and  domestics. 

An  additional  building  has  recently  been  erected,  to  the 
west,  for  water  purposes.  The  water  is  raised  by  a  steam  engine 
in  the  cellar,  from  a  large  well,  and  forced  into  tanks  in  the 
upper  story.  All  the  washing  and  drying,  together  with  the 
baking,  &amp;c,  is  done  by  steam  in  this  building. 

The  whole  establishment  is  enclosed  by  a  wall  ten  feet  high  ; 
it  has  received  from  the  citizens  the  name  of  the  "  ugly  wall/' 
and  we  think  justly  so,  when  the  splendid  edifices  it  encloses 
are  taken  into  consideration. 

There  are  two  gates  of  entrance,  one  on  the  north  and  one  on 
the  south  front  of  the  main  edifice. 

The  college  grounds  contain  about  41  acres,  the  eastern  por- 
tion of  which  is  laid  out  in  grass-plats,  and  gravel  and  paved 
walks,  between  and  around  all  the  buildings.  The  western 
portion  of  the  estate,  which  contains  20  acres,  is  laid  out  in 
gardens,  &amp;c. ;  a  convenient  farmhouse,  barn,  and  outbuildings, 
have  been  erected  on  it. 

The  whole  cost  of  this  magnificent  college,  including  the 
improvements  of  the  grounds,  &amp;c,  was  $1,933,821  78,  which 
is  $66,198  22  within  the  amount  specified  by  Mr.  Girard,  for 
the  erection  and  endowment  of  the  Institution. 

The  whole  of  this  building  has  been  erected  in  strict  accor- 
dance with  the  will  of  its  founder,  with  the  exception  of  the 
portico,  and  that  is  justified  by  the  proviso,  that  "  utility  and 
good  taste  should  be  left  to  determine  in  particulars  not  speci-

fied  in  the  will."  Let  those  who  object,  look  at  the  building, 
and  say  whether  it  would  have  been  a  tasteful  object  without 
the  portico. 

Last  year,  the  remains  of  Mr.  Girard  were  removed  from  the 
churchyard,  Spruce  and  Sixth  Streets,  and  now  rest  tempo- 
rarily in  the  lower  vestibule,  on  the  south  end  of  the  building, 
beneath  a  statue  of  himself,  beautifully  cut  in  marble.  It  is 
said  to  be  a  good  likeness. 

There  is  no  country  that  possesses,  either  among  the  ruins 
of  ancient  or  the  work  of  modern  days,  a  more  beautiful  struc- 
ture than  this,  or  one  in  which  chasteness  of  design,  richness 
of  decoration,  and  exquisite  skill  of  workmanship,  are  more 
happily  combined;  and  it  is  a  subject  of  congratulation  that 
every  part  of  it  was  executed  by  American  workmen. 

The  number  of  orphans  at  present  in  the  College  is  305. 
The  "  will"  is  the  governing  principle  of  the  Institution ;  it 
provides  that  the  orphans  shall  be  instructed  in  the  various 
branches  of  a  sound  education,  comprising,  reading,  writing, 
grammar,  arithmetic,  geography,  navigation,  surveying,  prac- 
tical mathematics,  astronomy,  natural,  chemical,  and  experi- 
mental philosophy,  the  French  and  Spanish  languages,  and 
such  other  sciences  and  learning  as  the  capacities  of  the  pupils 
may  merit  or  warrant. 

It  further  directs  that  the  orphans  should  be  admitted  be- 
tween the  age  of  six  and  ten  years,  and  that  those  who  merit 
it  shall  remain  in  the  college  until  between  the  age  of  four- 
teen and  eighteen  years,  when  they  are  to  be  bound  out  to 
some  useful  occupation,  such  as  agriculture,  mechanical  trades, 
arts,  &amp;c. 

The  officers  and  teachers  of  the  Institution  at  present  com- 
prise a  president,  a  secretary,  two  professors,  two  physicians, 
a  matron,  an  assistant  matron,  five  male  teachers,  twelve  female 
teachers,  and  a  steward.

PUBLIC    SCHOOLS. 

The  early  settlers  of  Pennsylvania  well  knew  the  importance 
of  education,  and  encouraged  its  diffusion.  The  illustrious 
Penn  says,  in  his  Frame  of  Government,  "  Let  men  be  good, 
and  the  government  cannot  be  bad;  but  if  men  be  bad,  let  the 
government  be  ever  so  good,  they  will  warp  and  spoil  it,  to 
their  turn.  Those,  therefore,  who  make  a  good  government 
must  keep  it;  viz.,  men  of  wisdom  and  virtue,  which  qualities, 
because  they  are  not  inherited,  must  be  propagated  by  a  na- 
tional education  of  youth. "  No  system  of  general  education 
was,  however,  attempted  during  our  colonial  existence.  The 
patriots  who  framed  the  first  state  constitution,  provided,  "  that 
a  school  or  schools  shall  be  established  in  each  county  by  the

legislature  for  the  convenient  instruction  of  youth,  and  that 
all  useful  learning  shall  be  duly  encouraged,  in  one  or  more 
universities." 

The  Constitution  of  1790  directed  that  "the  legislature  should, 
as  soon  as  conveniently  may  be,  provide  by  law,  for  the  esta- 
blishment of  schools  throughout  the  State,  in  such  manner  that 
the  poor  may  be  taught  gratis." 

Notwithstanding  these  provisions,  little  was  done  by  public 
authority  towards  promoting  this  great  national  cause,  until 
the  year  1818,  when  the  act  "  to  provide  for  the  education  of 
children  at  the  public  expense,  within  the  city  and  county  of 
Philadelphia,"  was  passed. 

This  act  was  the  foundation  of  our  system  of  common  schools. 
The  intelligent  regarded  the  success  of  this  experiment  with 
deep  solicitude,  and  they  soon  had  reason  to  be  gratified  with 
the  results. 

In  the  Lancasterian  system,  then  popular,  there  were,  how- 
ever, serious  and  inherent  defects,  and  the  controllers  and  direc- 
tors became  convinced  that  a  radical  change  was  necessary. 
It  was  made ;  and  the  monitors  were  succeeded  by  assistant 
teachers. 

In  the  year  1828,  the  controllers  were  authorized  to  establish 
schools  for  the  instruction  of  children  under  five  years  of  age ', 
and  in  1832,  a  model  infant  school  was  opened.  Secondary 
schools  were  subsequently  established,  and  the  infant  schools 
changed  to  primary. 

The  Central  High  School,  Juniper  below  Market  Street, 
is  a  beautifully-situated  building,  with  a  marble  front,  embel- 
lished with  a  portico  in  the  Ionic  order.  This  school  was 
established  in  October,  1838,  and  has  ever  since  been  in  suc- 
cessful operation.  Its  high  character  is  widely  known  and 
appreciated ;  and  our  city  may  well  be  proud  of  an  institution

which,  we  think,  is  not  surpassed  by  any  similar  one  in  this 
country. 

Since  its  establishment,  upwards  of  2130  students  have 
enjoyed  its  benefits.  The  average  number  attending  the  school 
at  present  is  about  500.  The  course  of  studies  taught,  is  well 
calculated  to  prepare  them  for  a  career,  honourable  alike  to 
themselves,  and  useful  to  their  country.  These  studies  com- 
prise Latin  and  Greek,  French  and  Spanish,  extra  English, 
English  and  Anglo-Saxon,  belles-lettres,  history,  moral,  men- 
tal, and  political  sciences,  mathematics,  graphics,  anatomy, 
physiology,  natural  history,  natural  philosophy,  and  chemistry. 

The  examinations  of  candidates  for  admission  are  held  semi- 
annually, in  January  and  July.  Candidates  to  be  admitted  must 
be  twelve  years  of  age,  must  have  passed  at  least  one  year  in 
one  of  the  public  schools  of  this  district,  and  must  show  on

examination  that  he  can  read,  write,  and  spell  correctly,  and 
that  he  has  a  competent  knowledge  of  grammar,  geography, 
history,  arithmetic,  algebra,  and  mensuration. 

In  the  year  1819,  there  were  in  the  first  school  district  10 
schools,  2845  pupils,  and  10  teachers.  At  present  there  are 
256  schools,  727  teachers,  and  about  50,000  scholars. 

The  number  and  designation  of  these  schools  are,  1  High, 
1  Normal,  53  Grammar,  29  Secondary,  130  Primary,  and  40 
unclassified,  all  under  the  direction  of  23  controllers  and  210 
directors,  distributed  throughout  the  eleven  sections,  comprising 
the  city  and  county  of  Philadelphia. 

These  schools,  since  their  organization,  have  been  continued 
with  increasing  interest,  by  the  controllers  and  directors.  Our 
citizens  regard  their  support  as  a  social  requirement  and  public 
obligation,  their  efficiency  and  usefulness  being  abundantly 
manifest,  from  the  great  number  annually  emanating  from 
them,  instructed  in  all  the  useful  branches  of  education. 

To  render  the  instruction  in  the  public  schools  still  more 
perfect,  the  controllers  and  directors  were  authorized  to  esta- 
blish the  Normal  School,  for  the  instruction  of  female  teachers, 
which  was  done  in  1848.  The  instruction  of  the  pupils  in 
this  school,  consists  of  a  thorough  training  in  all  the  branches 
taught  in  the  public  schools,  with  reference  to  teaching,  toge- 
ther with  such  a  course  of  mental  and  moral  discipline,  as  shall 
improve  the  understanding  and  elevate  the  character.  The 
course  of  instruction  extends  through  a  term  of  two  years,  and 
is  the  very  best  that  could  possibly  be  adopted  to  accomplish 
the  design  of  its  establishment. 

The  examination  of  candidates  for  admission  is  semi-annual, 
in  February  and  July.  To  be  admitted  as  a  pupil,  the  candi- 
date must  be  fifteen  years  of  age,  and  must  be  proficient  in 
orthography,  definition  of  words,  reading,  English  Grammar, 
History  of  the  United  States,  arithmetic  and  penmanship,  and

The  Philadelphia  Society  for  the  Establishment 
and  Support  of  Charity  Schools,  was  incorporated  the  6th 
of  April,  1791.  This  association  was  organized  for  the  purpose 
of  establishing  and  supporting  schools,  to  educate  gratis  in 
reading,  writing,  arithmetic,  and  other  useful  learning,  chil- 
dren of  the  poor,  of  all  denominations,  in  the  city  of  Philadelphia, 
the  districts  of  Southwark,  and  the  Northern  Liberties.  The 
school,  Walnut  Street  west  of  Sixth,  under  charge  of  this  So- 
ciety, has  always  maintained  a  high  character.  The  average 
number  of  pupils  attending,  is  about  one  hundred  and  fifty. 
The  studies  pursued  in  the  Boys'  Grammar  School,  comprise 
reading,  penmanship,  arithmetic,  algebra,  mensuration,  gram- 
mar, geography,  and  History  and  Constitution  of  the  United 
States.  The  girls,  in  addition  to  their  studies,  are  taught 
various  branches  of  needlework.  This  is  very  important,  and 
will  probably,  in  after  life,  be  of  great  value  to  them. 

This  association  is  principally  supported  in  its  labours  by 
the  patronage  of  the  benevolent. 

House  of  Refuge. — This  noble  school  of  reformation,  was 
incorporated  on  the  23d  of  March,  1826.  Its  object  is  "the 
employment  of  the  idle,  instruction  of  the  ignorant,  reformation 
of  the  depraved — a  general  diffusion  of  good  morals,  enlarge- 
ment of  virtuous  society,  and  the  protection  of  life  and  property. 
Various  Acts  of  Assembly  have  been  subsequently  passed,  in 
aid  of  the  Institution,  and  in  extending  its  benefits.  Persons 
under  the  age  of  twenty-one  years,  may  be  sent  to  the  "  Refuge" 
by  the  different  criminal  courts  throughout  the  State ;  also  by 
the  magistrates  of  the  City  and  County  of  Philadelphia,  in 
either  of  the  following  modes,  viz.,  "  on  the  complaint  of  the 
parent,  guardian,  or  next  friend,  and  with  due  proof  that  such 
infant  is  vicious  and  beyond  the  control  of  such  parent,  guardian,

is  a  proper  subject  for  the  House  of  Refuge,  in  consequence  of 
vagrancy  or  vicious  conduct,  and  that  the  parent,  guardian,  &amp;c, 
in  whose  care  such  infant  is,  is  incapable  or  unwilling  to  exercise 
a  proper  control  over  the  said  infant." 

There  are  two  departments  in  the  institution ;  one  for  white, 
and  the  other  for  coloured  children. 

The  white  department,  is  situated  on  Coates  Street,  between 
Schuylkill  Seventh  and  Eighth  Streets.  The  area  occupied  is 
about  two  and  a  quarter  acres.  The  buildings  were  erected 
in  1827  and  1828.  They  accommodate  170  boys  and  70  girls. 
The  first  inmate  was  received  on  the  8th  of  December,  1828. 

The  coloured  department,  situated  on  the  corner  of  William 
and  Parrish  Streets,  was  opened  on  the  1st  of  January,  1850. 
The  lot  on  which  these  buildings  stand,  is  400  by  210  feet. 
The  plan  contemplates  the  accommodation  of  154  boys  and  98 
girls ;  but  provision  is  at  present  only  made  for  72  of  the 
former  and  36  of  the  latter.  Want  of  funds  has  prevented  the 
completion  of  this  praiseworthy  object. 

Great  improvements  have  been  introduced  into  these  build- 
ings ;  they  are  well  warmed,  lighted,  and  ventilated,  and  are 
very  commodious.  They  were  erected  at  a  cost  of  $70,000. 
It  is  in  contemplation  by  the  managers  to  erect  new  buildings, 
for  the  accommodation  of  the  white  children,  when  the  neces- 
sary funds  are  obtained.  An  admirable  site,  adjqining  that  of 
the  coloured  department,  has  been  obtained.  The  lot  is  ample, 
being  400  feet  square.  A  plan  of  the  buildings,  &amp;c,  has  been 
selected  by  the  board  of  managers,  which  will,  if  fully  carried 
out,  accommodate  500  children .  No  effort,  we  trust,  will  be  want- 
ing to  make  these  new  buildings  a  model  for  all  similar  institu- 
tions. The  boys  in  the  white  department,  are  employed  in  caning 
chair  seats,  bookbinding,  and  making  razor  straps ;  while  those 
in  the  coloured  department,  are  occupied  in  making  umbrella

Circular. — We  avail  ourselves  of  this  opportunity  to  announce  our 
removal  to  Goldsmiths'  Hall,  Library  Street,  where,  in  larger  and 
more  convenient  premises,  we  shall  continue  our  business  as  manu- 
facturers of  Watch  Cases  and  Dials,  and  Assay ers  and  Dealers  in  Gold 
and  Silver  Bullion. 

We  tender  thanks  to  our  customers  for  the  business  they  have  been

hereafter  study  still  more  closely  to  please.

shall  endeavour  to  give  every  satisfaction  in  the  style  and  character 
of  work  entrusted  to  us. 

Being  confident  that  we  are  now  better  prepared  than  ever  to  serve 
the  wants  of  the  Watch  Trade,  we  respectfully  solicit  orders.

furniture.  The  cooking,  washing,  making,  and  mending,  for 
the  respective  establishments,  are  done  by  the  female  inmates, 
who  thus  acquire  a  thorough  knowledge  of  housekeeping. 
Rather  more  than  four  hours  a  day  are  devoted  to  the  school- 
room, and  nearly  eight  hours  to  the  shops.  We  were  much 
pleased  with  the  cleanly  and  comparatively  happy  appearance 
of  these  children ; — indeed,  it  is  necessary  to  visit  this  Institu- 
tion to  fully  realize  its  benefits  to  those,  otherwise  outcasts  of 
society.  A  year's  training,  we  are  told,  is  generally  found  suffi- 
cient to  produce  the  desired  reformation.  When,  in  the  opi- 
nion of  the  proper  committee,  an  inmate  is  properly  prepared,  a 
suitable  place  is  obtained  for  him.  When  a  child  leaves  the 
Refuge,  the  managers  keep  a  parental  eye  to  his  future  welfare, 
and  the  master  under  whose  charge  he  is  placed,  is  required  to 
communicate  yearly,  to  the  superintendent,  an  account  of  the 
health,  conduct,  and  improvement  of  his  apprentice.  In  most 
instances,  these  accounts  are  favourable.  In  conclusion,  we 
may  confidently  say,  that  the  Institution  under  notice,  has 
produced  immense  benefits,  not  only  to  the  children  who  have 
enjoyed  its  advantages,  but  to  the  community  at  large.  Such 
schools,  indeed,  are  required  in  every  populous  city,  where 
strong  temptations  allure  the  young  and  unwary  from  the 
paths  of  virtue. 

Strangers  are  admitted  every  afternoon,  except  Saturday  and 
Sunday.  Tickets  can  be  obtained  from  a  manager,  a  judge,  or 
the  mayor  of  the  city.  Citizens  are  only  admitted  on  Wednes- 
day, at  two  o'clock  P.  m.     Tickets  can  be  obtained  as  above. 

"The  Refuge"  is  sustained  by  aid  from  the  State  and  the 
County  of  Philadelphia,  by  life  and  annual  subscribers,  lega- 
cies of  the  benevolent,  and  the  labour  of  the  inmates.  Fifty 
dollars  constitutes  a  life,  and  two  dollars  an  annual,  subscrip- 
tion.

ACADEMY    OF    THE    VISITATION.  147 

Academy  or  the  Protestant  Episcopal  Church. — 
This  Institution  was  established  in  1785,  under  the  auspices  of 
the  late  Bishop  White,  and  revived  in  1846,  under  those  of 
Bishop  Potter.  The  Academy,  lately  erected  in  Locust  Street, 
near  Broad,  is  a  noble  building,  in  the  Elizabethan  style,  con- 
structed of  red  stone. — The  pupils  are  conducted  through  a 
course  of  classical  and  elementary  instruction ;  to  such  as  have 
the  ministry  in  view,  those  branches  of  learning  are  taught, 
which  the  canons  of  this  church  require  as  preliminary  to  an 
entrance  upon  a  course  of  theological  study.  A  playground 
is  attached  to  the  building,  and  the  upper  stories  are  furnished 
with  gymnastic  implements  for  the  exercise  of  the  pupils. 

Theological  Seminary  of  St.  Charles  Borromeo. — 
Schuylkill  Fifth  and  Kace  Streets.  This  Institution  was  in- 
corporated in  1848,  and  is  under  the  direction  of  Lazaritists, 
or  priests  of  the  Congregation  of  Missions.  It  is  supported, 
principally,  by  the  voluntary  donations  of  the  faithful  of  the 
diocese.  The  number  of  students  is  about  thirty,  twenty-one 
of  whom  are  preparing  for  orders :  within  the  past  year  four 
priests  have  been  ordained.  The  Seminary  buildings  have 
lately  been  enlarged  and  much  improved. 

Philadelphia  Academy  of  the  Visitation,  situated 
on  the  southwest  corner  of  Broad  and  Poplar  Streets.  The  loca- 
tion of  this  Institution,  and  the  adaptation  of  the  buildings  and 
grounds  to  the  health,  comfort,  and  recreation  of  the  inmates, 
are  such,  as  to  excite  the  admiration  of  all  who  are  interested 
therein.  Its  position  is  peculiarly  favourable,  fronting  on  the 
noblest  avenue  in  Philadelphia,  and  situated  on  one  of  the 
highest  points  of  ground  in  the  vicinity.  This  beautiful  build- 
ing is  of  marble,  in  the  Grecian  style.  It  was  erected  origi- 
nally by  one  of  our  wealthy  citizens  as  a  private  mansion;  it 
possesses  every  convenience  for  the  purpose  to  which  it  is  now 
appropriated.     It  is  surrounded  by  a  garden,  enclosed  in  front

are  spacious,  tastefully  laid  out,  and  planted  with  choice  and 
beautiful  shade  trees,  shrubs,  and  flowers.  The  Academy  is 
under  the  direction  of  the  Ladies  of  Visitation. 

It  may  be  well  to  say  that  this  is  also  the  Convent  of  the 
Visitation  of  the  Blessed  Virgin  Mary.  There  are  nineteen 
members  in  the  community,  thirteen  of  whom  are  professed.

to  such  persons  as  from  indigence  or  other  cause  were  deprived 
of  the  advantages  of  moral  and  intellectual  culture  in  daily 
schools.  The  first  school  opened  by  the  Society  was  at  the 
corner  of  Arch  and  Third  Streets.  This  was  the  first  free  school 
in  the  State.  A  second  was  shortly  afterwards  opened  in  Front 
near  Arch  Street.  The  success  attending  this  movement,  in- 
duced its  friends  to  petition  the  Legislature,  praying  "them  to 
establish  free  schools  throughout  the  State  I"  In  1797,  an  act 
of  incorporation  was  granted  to  this  Society,  whose  mission  was 
to  prepare  the  way  for  other  and  more  improved  organizations. 
In  consequence  of  the  formation  of  Sunday  Schools  by  the 
various  religious  denominations,  the  necessity  of  those  under 
notice  were  in  a  great  degree  obviated,  and  they  were  closed 
about  the  year  1819. 

At  a  meeting  of  the  Society  in  that  year,  the  Board  of  Visi- 
ters were  authorized  to  apply  the  funds  of  the  Institution  in 
future,  as  they  might  from  time  to  time  deem  advisable,  to- 
wards the  support  of  Sunday  Schools  already  established  in 
this  city.  The  funds  of  the  Society  are  invested  in  mortgages, 
ground  rents,  &amp;c,  the  annual  interest  of  which  is  about  $300.

Robert  Raikes  Union  Sunday  School,  Sixth  below

The  school  is  designed  for  those  children  who  would  otherwise 
"run  the  street  on  the  Sabbath,"  although  many  respectable 
and  worthy  people  send  their  families  to  it.  It  is  under  the

outskirts  of  the  city,  those  children,  whose  education,  morals, 
and  religious  training,  have  been  neglected;  to  rescue,  to 
teach,  and  to  elevate  them  to  respectability  and  usefulness. 
Every  friend  and  lover  of  his  kind,  ought  to  be  a  supporter  of 
the  Howard  School. 

The  Atmwell  School  Society,  was  established  in  the 
year  1796,  principally  by  the  Society  of  Friends,  for  the  gra- 
tuitous instruction  of  female  children.  We  visited  one  of 
these  schools,  situated  in  Cherry  Street,  below  Tenth,  on  the 
north  side,  and  were  much  pleased  with  the  arrangement 
of  the  building,  and  the  order  and  strict  attention  to  their 
studies  manifested  by  the  children.  The  course  of  studies 
embraces  only  the  useful  branches.     They  are  taught  well. 

In  addition  to  the  above  institutions,  there  are  numerous 
others,  supported  by  the  benevolent,  or  by  the  different  reli- 
gious denominations.  Among  which,  are  the  free  schools  for 
the  education  of  coloured  children,  the  parish  schools 
attached  to  the  Episcopal  and  Roman  Catholic  Churches, 
the  Presbyterian  Institute,  the  Adelphia  School,  the  Free 
School  for  the  education  of  Negro  Children,  founded  by  Dr. 
Bray,  in  1696,  and  established  by  "  his  associates,"  in  this  city 
at  an  early  date;  together  with  those  established  and  sup- 
ported by  the  Society  of  Friends.  This  last  Society  was  the 
first  to  establish  institutions  for  the  promotion  of  literature  in 
Pennsylvania.  The  first  charter  granted  for  this  purpose  was 
that  by  William  Penn,  in  1697,  "to  the  overseers  of  the 
schools."  Nor  should  we  forget  the  numerous  private  schools 
and  academies  which  abound  in  all  parts  of  the  city  and  dis- 
tricts, the  very  names  of  which  would  exceed  the  limits  of  the 
present  chapter.

CHAPTER  V. 


MEDICAL    COLLEGES. 


Few  cities  are  more  renowned  than  Philadelphia.  True,  she 
is  not  celebrated  in  historic  page,  the  beguiling  legend,  or 
poetic  song,  for  battles  or  for  bloody  sieges.  Her  fame  is 
more  lasting.  She  has  been  honoured  by  the  sojourn  and 
paternal  care  of  the  peaceful,  yet  heroic  William  Penn,  and 
of  Washington,  of  Patrick  Henry,  John  Adams,  and  their 
compatriots.  Here  has  been  the  home  of  Franklin,  Morris, 
Logan,  and  Rittenhouse.  Here  convene  the  scientific,  phi- 
lanthropic, and  political  conventions,  and  the  deliberative  as- 
semblies of  the  various  religious  societies;  and  here  stands 
the  Hall  of  Independence,  where  the  memorable  Declaration  of 
Freedom  was  promulgated,  which  has  sounded  so  loudly,  and 
which  yet  reverberates  in  the  ears  of  an  awakening  world. 

Of  the  many  public  institutions  of  which  this  city  can  boast, 
none  surpass  those  for  medical  education.  In  this  department 
of  science  she  has  been  favoured  with  the  labours  of  a  Shippen, 
Rush,  Wistar,  Physick,  Barton,  Dewees,  Godman,  Eberle,  and 
a  host  of  others. 

No  less  celebrated  or  entitled  to  regard  are  those  who  are 
now  advancing  medical  science.  They  are  men  of  whom  we 
may  justly  feel  proud,  and  their  labours  add  no  small  amount 
to  the  laurels  won  by  those  just  mentioned.  Here  obstetrics 
has  become  a  science,   and    surgery  advanced   equal   to   its

She  has  the  oldest  surgical  clinic,  and  can  show  the  greatest 
number  of  surgical  operations,  and  the  largest  medical  library 
in  the  country.  Here  was  established  the  first  medical  school 
in  the  Union,  and  here  are  now  the  largest  number  of 
medical  colleges,  the  most  valuable  publications,  the  most 
learned  authors,  and  by  far  the  greatest  number  of  medical 
students. 

What  more  is  requisite  to  justify  the  assertion,  that  Phila- 
delphia is  the  Medical  Metropolis  of  the  United  States?

The  University  of  Pennsylvania,  Ninth  Street  below 
Market.  The  University  of  Pennsylvania  had  been  in  existence, 
first  as  a  simple  Academy  and  then  a  College,  some  sixteen 
years  before  a  system  of  medical  instruction  was  admitted  into 
its  plan.  This  event  took  place  on  the  3d  of  May,  1765,  the 
date  at  which  the  first  medical  professor  was  appointed.  This 
was  undoubtedly  the  first  Medical  College  in  the  United 
States.

UNIVERSITY    OF    PENNSYLVANIA.  161 

The  idea  of  establishing  this  school  in  Philadelphia  was  con- 
ceived by  Dr.  Wm.  Shippen  and  Dr.  John  Morgan.  Some 
conversation  upon  the  subject  passed  between  these  gentle- 
men, while  prosecuting  their  studies  in  Europe ;  but  to  which 
of  the  two  the  merit  of  priority  in  the  conception  belongs,  has 
not  been  determined.  Dr.  Shippen,  on  his  return  from  Europe 
in  1765,  delivered  a  course  of  lectures  in  this  city  on  anato- 
my, in  the  introduction  to  which  he  expressed  his  belief  "  in 
the  expediency  and  practicability  of  teaching  medicine  in  all 
its  branches  in  Philadelphia."  In  the  mean  time,  Dr.  Morgan 
formed  the  project  of  engrafting  a  Medical  Department  on  the 
College  of  Philadelphia,  and  secured  in  its  favour  several  of  the 
most  influential  friends  of  the  Institution  both  in  Great  Britain 
and  America.  The  project  was  laid  before  the  trustees,  on  the 
3d  of  May,  1765,  and  approved.  Dr.  Morgan  was  immediately 
appointed  Professor  of  the  Theory  and  Practice  of  Medicine, 
and  on  the  23d  of  September,  the  same  year,  Dr.  Shippen  was 
appointed  Professor  of  Anatomy  and  Surgery.  Since  then  the 
number  of  Professors  has  been  increased,  until,  at  the  present 
time,  they  comprise  a  Professor  of  the  Theory  and  Practice  of 
Medicine,  a  Professor  of  Chemistry,  a  Professor  of  Surgery, 
a  Professor  of  Anatomy,  a  Professor  of  the  Institutes  of  Medi- 
cine, a  Professor  of  Obstetrics  and  Diseases  of  Women  and 
Children,  a  Professor  of  Materia  Medica  and  Pharmacy,  and  a

The  regular  course  of  Lectures  in  this  Institution  commences  early  in 
October,   and  continues  until  the  1st  of  March.     The  annual  Com- 
mencement for  conferring  Degrees  is  held  early  in  March. 
The  Faculty  is  composed  as  follows : 

ROBLEY  DUNGLISON,  M.D., 
Professor  of  Institutes  of  Medicine,  $c. 

ROBERT  M.  HUSTON,  M.D., 

Prof,  of  Materia  3Iedica  and  General  Therapeutics.

The  College  is  in  Tenth  Street  below  Chestnut.  It  is  a  beautiful 
and  commodious  structure,  which  has  been  modified  and  enlarged, 
from  time  to  time,  to  adapt  it  for  the  necessary  number  of  students. 

The  Chemical  Laboratory,  and  the  different  Cabinets  and  Museum 
are  well  supplied  with  materials  for  teaching;  and  connected  with 
the  buildings  is  an  hospital  department  for  the  reception  of  surgical 
cases  especially. 

Every  Wednesday  and  Saturday  in  the  month  of  October,  and  during 
the  course,  Medical  and  Surgical  cases  are  investigated,  prescribed 
for,  and  lectured  on  before  the  class.  During  the  last  year  nineteen 
hundred  and  seventy-nine  cases  were  treated,  and  two  hundred  and 
seventy-three  operations  performed.  Amongst  these  were  many  major 
operations — as  lithotomy,  amputation  of  the  leg,  arm,  &amp;c,  extirpation 
of  the  eye  and  mamma  ;  trephining,  extensive  plastic  operations  ;  re- 
section of  the  femur  for  anchylosis,  &amp;c,  &amp;c. 

The  Lectures  are  so  arranged  as  to  permit  the  student  to  attend 
the  Lectures  and  Clinical  Demonstrations  at  the  Pennsylvania  Hospital. 

On  and  after  the  1st  of  October,  the  dissecting  rooms  are  open, 
under  the  direction  of  the  Professor  of  Anatomy  and  the  Demonstra- 
tor, Dr.  Ellerslie  Wallace. 

The  Fees  are  as  follows  : 

Matriculation,  which  is  paid  only  once,  $5  00 

To  each  Professor,  $15,        ...  105  00 

For  Graduation,        ....  30  00 

The  number  of  students  during  the  session  1850-51,  was  504;  and 
of  Graduates  227.

stration,  and  the  chemical  apparatus  is  equal  in  extent  and 
variety  to  any  other  in  the  country. 

The  Medical  Hall  is  admirably  adapted  for  the  purposes  of 
the  school.  It  is  central  in  location,  and  has  ample  space 
around  for  free  circulation  of  air.  Its  dimensions  and  archi- 
tectural character  are  such  as  not  to  appear  incongruous  with 
the  extent  of  the  school  and  the  high  objects  for  which  it  was 
established. 


JEFFERSON  MEDICAL  COLLEGE. 


The  Jefferson  Medical  College  was  established  in 
1825,  and  chartered  the  same  year. 

The  College  building,  Tenth  Street,  between  Chestnut  and 
Walnut,  has  been  repeatedly  enlarged,  in  order  to  accommodate 
the  constantly  increasing  number  of  students. 

The  principal  of  these  enlargements  took  place  in  the  year 
1845,  when  the  nourishing  condition  of  the  school  was  such  as 
to  render  the  old  building  (itself  already  very  large)  entirely 
inadequate  to  the  purpose  for  which  it  was  intended.  The 
building  as  it  appears  at  present,  was  designed  by  Mr.  N.  Le 
Brun,  architect,  and  exhibits,  on  a  lot  of  limited  dimensions,  the

This  Agency  is  now  doing  business  for  five  different  Companies,  all 
of  which  have  promptly  and  liberally  paid  their  losses  in  this  city. 
Their  aggregate  capital  is  heavy,  giving  us  facilities  for  insuring  to 
a  large  amount,  on  one  risk  or  property.  We  are  happy  in  being 
able  to  state,  that  our  efforts  to  afford  property  holders  their  insurance 
at  fair  rates,  appears  to  have  been  appreciated.  A  large  patronage 
has  been  kindly  extended ;  and  for  this  mark  of  public  confidence 
in  us,  as  underwriters,  we  feel  ourselves  greatly  indebted.

most  ample  and  convenient  arrangements.  The  front  is  em- 
bellished by  a  hexastyle  composite  portico  of  beautiful  and 
much-admired  proportions. 

The  entrance,  on  the  north  side  of  the  building,  leads  by  am- 
ple stairways  to  the  several  lecture-rooms,  &amp;c.  On  the  first 
floor  is  a  room  50  by  70  feet,  adjoining  which  is  the  Labor- 
atory, and  other  apartments  necessary  for  the  purpose  of 
the  lectures.  In  the  second  story  is  the  Anatomical  Lecture- 
room,  constructed  in  the  form  of  an  amphitheatre,  and  of  the 
same  dimensions  as  the  room  below. 

The  arrangement  of  these  rooms  has  been  made  to  insure 
comfort  to  the  students,  while  the  important  desiderata  in 
such  establishments,  viz.,  light,  ventilation,  and  acoustic  adapta- 
tion, have  been  attended  to. 

A  magnificent  Museum  has  been  placed  in  the  rear  of  the 
building  on  this  story.  It  is  amply  provided  with  materials  for 
illustrating  the  various  branches.  In  addition  to  the  Osseous, 
Nervous,  Vascular,  Muscular,  Ligamentous,  and  other  prepara- 
tions for  anatomical  demonstration,  it  also  contains  a  large 
number  of  wet  preparations,  relating  to  Pathology,  Obstetrics, 
Surgery,  &amp;c,  and  an  extensive  collection  of  diseased  bones,  cal- 
culi, models  in  wood,  plaster,  and  wax,  together  with  an  ample 
series  of  paintings  and  engravings,  representing  healthy  and 
morbid  parts,  fractures,  dislocations,  tumours,  &amp;c,  and  the 
surgical  operations  necessary  for  their  relief. 

The  dissecting-room  is  over  the  Museum,  in  the  third  story. 
It  is  pronounced  one  of  the  very  best  in  the  city  for  this 
purpose. 

Convenient  rooms  for  the  Faculty,  and  private  chambers  for 
the  professors  and  students,  are  placed  in  rear  of  the  stairways. 

Attached  to  the  College  are  hospital  accommodations,  which 
form  part  of  the  clinic  of  the  Institution  :  they  are  under 
charge  of  the  different  Professors,  and  are  richly  supplied  with

With  the  citizens  of  Philadelphia  this  establishment  has  for  six 
years  been  the  most  popular  resort  for  Daguerreotypes.  The  pro- 
prietors pledge  themselves  to  continue  to  merit  their  high  reputation 
in  the  Daguerrean  Art. 

In  addition  to  the  extensive  Daguerreotype  business,  the  proprietors 
invite  an  inspection  of  their  improved  Talbotypes,  which  are  made 
to  resemble  the  finest  miniature  painting  in  effect  of  colour,  retaining 
all  the  truthfulness  of  the  Daguerreotype  in  likeness.

medical  and  surgical  cases,  forming  a  prominent  and  important 
element  in  the  educational  resources  of  the  establishment.  It 
appears  that  there  were  treated  in  this  department,  during 
the  clinical  year  ending  April  2d,  1851,  nineteen  hundred 
and  seventy-nine  cases,  of  which  one  thousand  and  seventy-four 
were  admitted  to  the  medical  department,  and  nine  hundred 
and  five  to  the  surgical.  This  list  exceeds  the  preceding  year 
by  two  hundred  and  seventy,  and  embraces  many  of  the  most 
important  medical  and  surgical  cases. 

The  Medical  Institute  of  Philadelphia,  founded  in 
1817,  owes  its  origin  to  the  Professors  of  the  Theory  and  Prac- 
tice of  Medicine  in  the  University  of  Pennsylvania,  and  for  a 
period  of  thirty -four  years  it  has  occupied  an  important  position 
among  the  medical  institutions  of  this  city,  being  in  fact  the 
oldest  among  them,  with  the  exception  of  the  University. 

The  object  of  Dr.  Chapman  in  founding  this  school  was,  pri- 
marily, to  benefit  his  large  class  of  office  students,  during  the 
interval  between  the  winter  sessions,  by  giving  them  a  com- 
bined course  of  medical  instruction.  For  this  purpose,  asso- 
ciations were  formed  at  different  periods,  with  Drs.  Horner,  T. 
Harris,  Mitchell,  Dewees,  Jackson,  Hodge,  Bell,  and  many 
other  gentlemen,  who  have  long  occupied  distinguished  public 
situations,  and  whose  names  are  widely  known  to  the  medical 
profession. 

The  design  of  the  Institution  differs  materially  from  that  of 
the  winter  schools,  with  which  it  has  no  connexion  whatever. 
It  confers  no  degree  or  diploma,  being  intended  rather  to 
afford  such  a  course  of  instruction,  practical  and  demonstrative, 
as  is  particularly  needed  by  those  students  who  remain  in  the 
city,  either  for  the  whole  period  of  their  study,  or  during  any 
single  interval  between  the  winter  lectures. 

The    course    of    instruction    embraces    Anatomy,    Materia

During  the  summer  of  1849,  the  Trustees  and  Faculty  erected  the 
beautiful  and  spacious  edifice  which  is  now  occupied,  situated  in 
Ninth  below  Locust  Street,  near  the  Pennsylvania  Hospital.  The 
building  is  as  well  adapted  to  its  object  as  any  similar  edifice  in  the 
.world,  and  has  ample  accommodations  for  a  class  of  four  hundred 
pupils.  The  appliances  for  heating  and  ventilation  are  after  the  most 
approved  modern  plans,  and  secure  a  steady,  comfortable  tempera- 
ture, with  a  free  access  of  fresh,  and  constant  discharge  of  foul  air. 
This  is  a  circumstance  of  much  importance,  in  view  of  the  fact  that 
the  health  of  students  so  frequently  suffers  from  confinement  in 
crowded  and  illy  ventilated  rooms.  The  building  contains  three 
Lecture  Rooms,  Museum,  Laboratory,  Anatomical  Rooms,  &amp;c. 

The  course  of  instruction  occupies  nearly  five  months,  without  any 
intermission.  There  are  six  lectures  delivered  daily,  except  on 
clinical  days,  when  there  are  only  four.  It  is  the  aim  of  each  Pro- 
fessor to  make  his  course  at  once  full,  comprehensive,  and  practical. 
All  the  branches  are  regarded  as  demonstrative,  and  are  so  taught. 
The  instruction,  therefore,  on  every  topic  of  medical  science,  is  ad- 
dressed to  the  eye,  as  well  as  the  ear  of  the  pupil.  Examinations  in 
each  branch  are  given  by  the  respective  Professors,  either  at  the 
commencement  of  each  lecture,  or  at  separate  hours.  All  the  pupils 
may  be  present  at  these  examinations. 

Clinical  Instruction. — The  Faculty  have  ever  regarded  Clinical  in- 
struction as  an  important  part  of  medical  teaching,  and,  in  ad- 
dition to  the  lectures  at  the  Pennsylvania  Hospital,  a  regular  Course 
of  Clinical  Medicine  and  Surgery  has  been  appointed,  to  continue 
throughout  the  year.  During  the  past  year  a  very  large  number  of 
cases  in  the  departments  of  Practice  and  Surgery,  with  numerous 
operations,  were  brought  before  the  class.  In  addition  to  these 
clinical  advantages  in  the  College,  all  second  course  students  are 
furnished,  free  of  expense,  with  tickets  to  the  Pennsylvania  Hospital, 
one  of  the  largest  and  best  arranged  institutions  in  this  country.  In 
this  hospital  about  two  thousand  cases  are  treated  during  the  year. 
^  The  requisites  for  graduation  are  the  same  as  those  of  the  Univer- 
sity of  Pennsylvania.

useful  in  design,  and  attractive  in  appearance.  The  building 
is  sixty  by  eighty  feet,  five  stories  high.  Its  front  elevation 
is  the  Collegiate  Gothic,  and,  being  adorned  with  embattle- 
ments  and  embrasures,  presents  to  our  city  a  new  style  of 
edifice,  at  once  substantial,  tasteful,  and  novel. 

The  building  contains  three  lecture-rooms,  the  arrangement 
of  which  is  such  as  to  admit  of  the  speaker  and  his  experi- 
ments and  demonstration,  being  seen  from  every  seat.  They 
are  all  constructed  on  acoustic  principles.  In  addition  to  those 
rooms,  there  is  a  spacious  Museum,  a  dissecting-room,  a  che- 
mical laboratory,  a  Registrar's  office,  private  rooms  for  the  Pro- 
fessors, together  with  various  ante-rooms  for  the  students,  and 
apartments  for  the  Janitor. 

The  Museum  is  beautifully  arranged.  It  is  22  feet  in  width, 
47  in  length,  and  24  high,  surrounded  on  all  sides  by  a  gallery 
12  feet  from  the  floor.  It  contains  a  great  variety  of  wet  and 
dry  preparations,  both  physiological  and  pathological,  models 
and  casts  in  plaster  and  wax,  together  with  an  extensive  series 
of  paintings,  diagrams,  and  plates,  classified  under  the  heads 
of  Anatomy,  Physiology,  Medical  and  Surgical  Pathology,  and 
Obstetrics,  in  addition  to  which  there  is  an  extensive  cabinet 
of  Materia  Medica,  and  a  well-selected  chemical  and  philoso- 
phical apparatus. 

The  dissecting-room  is  over  the  Museum.  It  is  well  lighted, 
well  ventilated,  and  every  way  adapted  to  its  purpose. 

The  facade  is  of  brown  stone,  and  is  ornamented  by  two 
massive  towers,  eighty  feet  high,  crowned  with  a  rich  em- 
battled parapet. 

The  corner-stone  of  this  edifice  was  laid  on  the  31st  of  May, 
1849,  and  the  building  completed  and  occupied  in  October, 
1850.

PHILADELPHIA     COLLEGE. 


The  Philadelphia  College  or  Medicine. — This  institu- 
tion was  chartered  in  1847,  with  all  the  rights,  privileges,  and 
immunities,  granted  to  other  medical  colleges  in  the  State. 

It  is  located,  for  the  present,  in  South  Fifth,  near  Walnut 
Street.  The  building  is  commodious,  and  centrally  situated, 
though  it  is  in  contemplation  to  erect  a  new  and  more  impos- 
ing edifice,  in  a  more  western  situation,  as  the  prospects  of  the 
school  go  on  improving.  In  the  present  building,  the  facilities 
for  instruction  are  abundantly  supplied,  the  lecture-rooms  are 
ample,  and  the  museum  is  one  of  the  best  in  the  city ;  the  dis-

secting-roorns  are  unsurpassed,  if  not  unequalled,  and  the  at- 
mosphere of  the  whole  building,  so  thorough  in  its  ventilation, 
is  perfectly  pure. 

The  full  period  of  study  is  the  same  in  this  institution  as 
that  at  the  other  colleges,  with  this  difference,  that  two  courses 
of  lectures  are  delivered  annually,  instead  of  one.  One  of 
these  is  termed  the  "  Winter  Course,"  commencing  in  Octo- 
ber; the  other  is  called  the  "  Spring  Course,"  commencing 
about  a  week  after  the  close  of  the  first,  on  or  about  the  10th 
of  March.  The  objects  of  this  Spring  Course  seem  sufficiently 
obvious,  while  its  advantages,  especially  to  the  students  coming 
from  a  distance,  are  important.  The  arrangements  of  the 
school  are  such  as  to  place  the  propriety  of  the  plan  beyond  a 
cavil,  and  to  render  the  advantages  absolute,  since  they  insure 
the  student  courses  of  instruction,  and  facilities  for  the  acqui- 
sition of  knowledge,  equally  full  in  the  spring  as  in  the 
winter. 

This,  though  a  new  enterprise,  is  in  successful  operation. 
The  Faculty  are  now  prosecuting  its  tenth  course  of  Lectures. 
The  statistics  exhibiting  a  flattering  increase,  both  in  reputa- 
tion and  size  of  classes.  The  corporation  has  conferred  9 
Adeundem,  19  Honorary,  and  215  full  degrees.  The  percent- 
age of  graduations  betokens  the  application  of  a  high  standard 
of  requirements,  to  the  qualifications  of  the  candidate  in  his 
final  examination ;  and  the  number  of  matriculants  speak  well 
for  the  reputation  and  teaching  capacity  of  the  Faculty — the 
number  of  its  attending  students  having  been  799. 

The  Faculty  comprises,  a  Professor  of  General  and  Special 
Surgical  Anatomy,  and  the  Principles  and  Practice  of  Surgery, 
a  Professor  of  General  Therapeutics,  Materia  Medica,  and 
Pharmacy;  a  Professor  of  the  Institutes  of  Medicine  and 
Medical  Jurisprudence ;  a  Professor  of  Medical  Chemistry ;  a

and  Toxicology ;  one  of  Surgery ;  one  of  Anatomy,  and  a  De- 
monstrator of  Anatomy. 

The  College  building,  Filbert  Street,  between  Eleventh  and 
Twelfth,  was  constructed  with  a  special  view  to  the  object 
to  which  it  is  now  appropriated.  The  lecture-rooms  are  com- 
modious, and  that  part  appropriated  to  dissection  is  admirably 
adapted  to  the  purpose,  being  large,  well-ventilated,  and  sup- 
plied with  all  the  conveniencies  necessary  for  the  comfort  of 
those  engaged  in  the  study  of  Practical  Anatomy. 

The  museum  contains  ample  materials  for  study,  in  wax 
models,  anatomical  preparations,  morbid  and  healthy  speci- 
mens, both  dry  and  wet,  and  a  large  collection  of  anatomical, 
surgical,  and  obstetrical  plates,  of  the  size  of  life,  a  cabinet  of 
minerals,  specimens  of  the  materia  medica,  and  philosophical 
instruments,  &amp;c. 

A  dispensary  is  connected  with  the  College,  at  which,  in  ad- 
dition to  the  regular  lectures,  clinical  instruction  is  given  by 
the  different  professors.  In  this  dispensary,  an  extensive 
range  of  disease  is  presented  for  study.  A  physician  is  in 
daily  attendance,  from  whose  examinations  and  prescriptions 
the  student  can  have  abundant  opportunities  of  acquiring  prac- 
tical information. 

We  learn  that  the  corporation  have  in  view  the  establish- 
ment of  an  hospital,  to  be  attached  to  this  Institution,  a  charter 
for  that  purpose  having  been  granted  by  the  State.  Energetic 
efforts  are  now  being  made  for  placing  this  charity  in  operation 
at  an  early  day. 

The  Female  Medical  College  of  Pennsylvania. — 
This  new  Institution  was  founded  in  1849,  principally  through 
the  exertions  and  influence  of  Win.  J.  Mullen,  Esq.  It  has 
the  distinguished  honour  of  being  not  only  the  first  school  of 
the  kind  in  the  United  States,  but  in  the  world. 

The  object  of  the  Institution  is  to  instruct  respectable  and

intelligent  females  in  the  various  branches  of  medical  science, 
whose  rights  and  privileges,  upon  receiving  the  degree  of  the 
Doctorate  in  this  school,  will  not  be  inferior  to  those  of  the 
graduates  of  any  other  medical  institution  in  this  country  or 
Europe. 

The  popularity  attending  the  first  establishment  of  this 
college  was  such,  that  the  Legislature  of  our  State  granted  it 
a  charter  as  broad  and  liberal  as  that  of  any  in  the  Common- 
wealth, upon  the  presentation  of  a  bare  petition. 

The  school,  so  far,  exceeds  the  most  sanguine  expectations 
of  its  warmest  friends.  The  number  of  students  attending 
the  present  course  of  lectures  is  about  forty,  from  all  parts  of 
the  country.  The  course  of  instruction  comprises  six  branches, 
viz.,  Anatomy  and  Physiology,  Principles  and  Practice  of  Medi- 
cine, Obstetrics  and  Diseases  of  Women  and  Children,  Surgery 
and  the  Institutes  of  Medicine,  Materia  Medica,  Pharmacy, 
and  Chemistry. 

The  Museum  is  amply,  and,  considering  its  age,  we  should 
rather  say  richly,  supplied.  It  contains  an  extensive  collection 
of  wet  and  dry  preparations,  illustrating  every  part  of  human 
Anatomy  and  Physiology;  together  with  a  large  proportion  of 
French  models  and  wax  preparations.  We  recommend  our 
readers  to  avail  themselves  of  the  opportunity  to  examine  this 
Museum.     It  is  open  during  the  Sessions. 

The  building,  229  Arch  Street,  occupied  at  present  by  the 
school  is  well  adapted  for  its  purpose,  being  perfectly  retired 
and  free  from  annoyance.  It  is  proposed,  when  sufficient 
funds  are  obtained,  to  erect  a  more  suitable  building  for  the 
accommodation  of  the  College.  We  hope  the  effort  will  be  suc- 
cessful, for  the  rapidly  increasing  number  of  students  will  soon 
render  the  present  one  entirely  inadequate. 

The  science  of  Obstetrics  in  this  country  is  almost  entirely 

in  the  hands  of  male  practitioners.     Why  should  this  be  so  ?

COLLEGE    OF    PHARMACY.  183 

From  the  earliest  history  of  the  art,  prior  to  1663,  it  was 
practised  by  females.  History  supplies  abundant  evidence  on 
this  point.  About  that  date,  the  Duchess  de  Vallieres,  a 
favourite  mistress  of  Louis  XIY.  of  France,  made  the  first 
innovation,  and  the  fortunate  attendant  was  soon  afterwards 
appointed  to  the  novel  yet  lucrative  office  of  Midwife  to  the 
Princess  of  France. 

Put  woman  in  possession  of  all  the  knowledge  upon  the 
subject  of  Midwifery,  and  let  her  use  it  for  the  relief  of  her 
sex.  If  she  could  manage  these  matters  so  exclusively  before 
the  dawnings  of  science,  how  much  more  so  now,  with  the 
light  it  has  afforded  !  If  there  is  one  appropriate  sphere  of 
more  consequence  than  another  within  the  scope  of  woman's 
duty,  it  is  at  the  bedside  of  a  suffering  sister.  Now,  as  for- 
merly, woman  is  most  willing  to  enter,  and  most  reluctant  to 
leave,  the  abodes  of  suffering  and  sorrow.  It  has  always  been 
her  office  to  administer  to  the  necessities  of  the  afflicted,  and 
most  nobly  has  she  sustained  it.  Why  then  ought  she  not  to 
be  educated  to  preside  over  the  duties  of  the  lying-in  chamber  ?

The  influence  of  this  College  during  the  thirty  years  that 
have  elapsed  since  that  time,  has  been  productive  of  a  general 
elevation  of  the  standard  of  knowledge  and  skill,  as  well  as 
of  professional  ethics,  among  the  Apothecaries  in  Philadel- 
phia; and  by  the  influence  of  its  well-conducted  quarterly, 
"  The  American  Journal  of  Pharmacy,"  and  by  the  scattering  of 
a  large  number  of  graduates  throughout  the  Union,  it  has  con- 
tributed toward  a  general  and  widespread  improvement  in  the 
Pharmaceutic  art.  The  Hall,  located  as  above,  was  built  in 
1832.  It  is  spacious  and  airy,  possessing  ample  room  for  the 
lectures,  apparatus,  cabinet,  and  library,  and  for  the  purposes 
generally  of  the  Institution. 

There  are  three  professorships  in  the  school,  embracing  the 
subjects  of  Materia  Medica,  Chemistry,  and  Pharmacy.  The 
annual  session  commences  and  ends  nearly  simultaneously 
with  those  of  the  Medical  Colleges.  The  lectures  are  deli- 
vered in  the  evenings  at  7  and  8  o'clock.

LITERARY   AND    SCIENTIFIC    INSTITUTIONS. 

"  Knowledge  hath  left  the  hermit's  ruined  cell, 
The  narrow  convent,  and  the  cloister's  gloom ; 
With  world-emhracing  wings  to  soar  and  dwell 
Mid  purer  ether  and  sublimer  room. 
The  volleyed  lightnings  of  her  press  consume 
The  tyrant's  strength,  and  strike  the  bigot  blind ; 
Day  after  day,  its  thunders  sound  the  doom 
Of  some  old  wrong,  too  hideous  for  the  mind, 
Which  reason  hath  illumed,  which  knowledge  hath  refined." 

It  is  always  a  source  of  gratification,  to  find  men,  whose 
daily  avocations  are  of  the  most  bustling  and  industrial  nature, 
availing  themselves  of  every  leisure  interval  to  cultivate  and 
increase  their  means  of  intellectual  enjoyment;  and  there  can 
be  no  greater  ornaments  to  a  city,  than  those  educational  and 
literary  institutions,  which,  springing  from  and  supported  by 
the  people,  are  adapted  to  the  public  wants ;  no  matter  whether 
the  buildings  are  of  brick,  costly  marble,  or  "  plain  rooms/' 
their  objects  consecrate  and  invest  them  with  a  host  of  pleasing 
and  pure  associations. 

In  the  very  centre  of  our  city,  where  the  hurry  of  trade, 
and  the  anxiety  of  the  law,  are  depicted  on  numbers  of  faces,  it 
is  alike  pleasing  to  the  visiter,  and  honourable  to  the  citizen, 
to  find  five  spacious  buildings  devoted  to  the  diffusion  of  know- 
ledge ;  we  allude  to  the  American  Philosophical  Society,  the 
Philadelphia  Library,  the  Athenaeum,  the  Franklin  Institute, 
and  the  Mercantile  Library.

AMERICAN    PHILOSOPHICAL     SOCIETY.  189 

Benjamin  Franklin,  we  owe  the  origin  of  the  association  which 
may  be  considered  as  the  germ  of  the  present  American  Philo- 
sophical Society. 

In  his  own  memoir,  he  tells  us  that,  in  the  autumn  of  1727, 
himself  and  several  of  his  ingenious  acquaintances  formed  a 
club,  "for  mutual  improvement."  It  was  called  "the  Junto." 
The  number  of  members  was  restricted  to  twelve,  and  in  some 
respects  their  meetings  were  secret,  to  prevent  the  application 
of  improper  persons  for  admission. 

It  appears  that  this  "  Junto"  continued  in  existence  nearly 
forty  years,  but  as  its  members  grew  old,  it  doubtless  lost  much 
of  its  activity  and  spirit,  and  probably,  long  before  its  close, 
the  meetings  were  held  only  for  sociability.  In  a  letter  to 
Hugh  Roberts,  written  in  July,  1765,  Dr.  Franklin  urges  his 
attendance  at  the  "Junto,"  and  says,  "We  loved,  and  still  love 
one  another;  we  are  grown  gray  together,  and  yet  it  is  too 
early  to  part.  Let  us  sit  still,  till  the  evening  of  life  is  spent. 
The  last  hours  are  always  the  most  joyous.  When  we  can 
stay  no  longer,  it  is  time  enough  then  to  bid  each  other  good 
night,  separate,  and  go  quietly  to  bed." 

This  "  Junto"  seems  to  have  been  a  mere  conversational  or 
debating  society,  similar  to  those  immortalized  by  Addison 
and  Johnson.  Yet  its  members  appear  to  have  taken  an 
active  part  in  establishing  various  social  reforms,  and  associa- 
tions for  the  promotion  of  useful  knowledge,  prominent  among 
which  is  the  one  under  notice. 

In  May,  1743,  Franklin  drew  up  and  issued  a  prospectus 
for  the  formation  of  such  an  association.  It  was  entitled, 
"  A  Proposal  for  the  Promotion  of  Useful  Knowledge  among 
the  British  Provinces  of  North  America;"  and  may  be  consi- 
dered the  true  origin  of  the  American  Philosophical  Society. 
The  first  members  were  all  men  of  science.  Their  early  efforts, 
however,  were  not  successful,  and  for  several  years  it  existed

but  in  name.  In  November,  1767,  only  six  of  their  number 
remained  in  Philadelphia ;  but  these  few  determined  upon 
making  an  effort  for  its  revival;  and  by  the  following  January 
they  succeeded  in  electing  forty-eight  others,  many  of  whom 
were  distinguished  for  their  talents,  rank,  and  influence  in  the 
community.  John  Penn,  the  then  Governor  of  the  Province, 
became  the  patron  of  the  Society.  The  Council  chamber  at 
the  State  House  was  granted  for  its  meetings,  and  it  had  also 
the  use  of  the  College  room,  and  apparatus  for  experiments. 
From  this  time  its  proceedings  were  conducted  with  spirit. 

In  the  year  1750,  there  was  another  scientific  association 
established  under  the  name  of  "The  Junto,"  in  which  subjects 
of  Natural  History,  Philosophy,  Morals,  Science,  &amp;c,  were 
considered  and  discussed.  In  1766,  having  increased  its  list 
of  members,  and  adopted  new  rules  for  the  admission  of  fo- 
reigners and  non-residents  as  correspondents,  the  association 
abandoned  the  name  of  "  Junto,"  and  adopted  that  of  the 
"  American  Society  for  Promoting  and  Propagating  Useful 
Knowledge." 

These  two  learned  bodies,  whose  organization  was  nearly 
similar,  and  whose  pursuits  and  objects  were  alike,  saw  the 
importance  of  a  union ;  and  in  1768,  proposals  to  this  effect 
were  made  by  the  American  Society  to  the  Philosophical 
Society.  After  considerable  negotiation,  the  measure  was 
effected,  and  the  two  societies  united.  Their  first  meeting 
was  held  January  2d,  1769.  They  were  incorporated  on  the 
15th  of  March,  1780,  as  the  "American  Philosophical  Society, 
for  Promoting  Useful  Knowledge,"  held  at  Philadelphia. 

The  early  transactions  of  this  association  contain  much 
curious  and  interesting  matter,  among  which  we  find  a  notice 
of  the  first  steam-engine  built  in  this  city ;  also  that  relative 
to  the  first  boat  ever  navigated  by  steam.  It  is  dated  Sept. 
27th,  1785,  and  reads  thus :  "The  model,  with  a  drawing  and

description  of  a  machine  for  working  a  boat  against  the  stream, 
by  means  of  a  steam-engine,  was  laid  before  the  Society  by  Mr. 
John  Fitch." 

During  the  Revolutionary  War,  the  meetings  were  in  a 
great  measure  suspended.  In  1779,  they  were,  however,  re- 
sumed, and  have  ever  since  been  continued. 

The  site  of  the  present  Hall  was  given  to  the  Society  by 
the  State,  in  1785,  the  building  erected  in  1789,  and  occu- 
pied in  1790.  It  is  a  plain  brick  structure,  remarkable  only 
for  its  location  and  historical  recollections.  It  consists  of  two 
stories  and  a  basement, — the  hall  of  the  association  occupying 
the  second  story. 

In  the  year  1786,  John  Hyacinth  De  Magellan,  of  London, 
gave  to  the  Society  two  hundred  guineas,  to  be  vested  as  a 
permanent  fund,  the  interest  of  which  should  be  annually  dis- 
posed of  in  premiums,  to  be  adjudged  to  the  best  author  of  the 
best  discovery,  or  the  most  useful  invention  relating  to  navi- 
gation, astronomy,  or  natural  philosophy. 

The  library  contains  about  20,000  volumes,  in  various  lan- 
guages, many  of  which  are  rare  and  valuable.  Few  books  are 
purchased,  except  scientific  periodicals;  the  accessions  being 
principally  by  gift  from  learned  societies  and  individuals.  The 
Society  also  possesses  an  extensive  cabinet  of  medals,  coins,  &amp;c, 
and  a  large  collection  of  maps,  charts,  engravings,  and  manu- 
scripts. The  meetings  are  held  on  the  first  and  third  Fridays 
of  every  month,  from  October  to  May,  and  on  the  third  Friday 
in  each  of  the  other  four  months,  at  7  o'clock,  p.  m.  The  Hall 
is  also  open  every  Friday  evening,  when  members  meet  for  the 
purpose  of  reading  and  social  intercourse.  On  these  occasions 
they  may  introduce  a  friend  or  stranger.  Charles  B.  Trego  is 
the  secretary  and  librarian. 

The  Philadelphia  Library  Company,  is  one  of  the 
oldest  and  most  extensive  in  this  country.     It  was  instituted

THE    PHILADELPHIA    LIBRARY.  195 

in  1731,  principally  through  the  influence  of  t)r.  Franklin, 
and  the  members  of  "  The  Junto."  The  first  importation  of 
books  was  received  from  London  in  1732,  and  the  Library 
opened  in  "  Robert  Grace's  house/'  Jones's  Alley.  In  1740, 
the  collection  of  books  having  largely  increased,  the  library 
was  removed  to  the  upper  room  of  the  west  wing  of  the 
State  House,  the  use  of  which  was  granted  to  the  Company  by 
the  Province.  On  the  13th  of  March,  1744,  the  Union  Library 
Company  of  Philadelphia  was  united  with  the  one  under 
notice ;  and,  in  consequence  of  the  additional  number  of  books 
and  members,  the  Library  was  opened  three  days  in  the  week, 
and  two  librarians  appointed.  In  1771,  two  additional  com- 
panies were  annexed.  In  1773,  the  books  were  removed  to  a 
more  spacious  apartment,  in  Carpenters'  Hall;  and  in  1790, 
the  Library  Company  took  possession  of  their  present  building. 

The  corner-stone  of  this  edifice  was  laid  on  the  31st  of  Au- 
gust, 1789.  It  is  a  plain,  substantial-looking  structure,  si- 
tuated on  Fifth  below  Chestnut  Street.  The  building  has  a 
truly  venerable  appearance.  The  front  entrance  is  surmounted 
by  a  well-executed  statue,  in  marble,  of  Dr.  Franklin. 

During  its  early  history,  this  institution  was  largely  en- 
riched by  donations  from  its  friends,  among  which  are  the 
choice  collections  of  curious  and  rare  books  presented  by  Ro- 
bert Barclay,  and  the  celebrated  "  Loganian  Library ;" — this 
last  was  a  most  valuable  acquisition.  It  was  the  private  li- 
brary of  the  Hon.  James  Logan,  the  confidential  friend  and 
counsellor  of  "William  Penn,  and  consists  principally  of  works 
in  the  learned  and  modern  languages  of  Europe.  This  rare 
collection  is  kept  in  a  room  appropriated  for  that  purpose. 
When  first  annexed  to  the  Philadelphia  Library,  it  contained 
3,953  volumes;  large  additions  are  made  to  it  annually,  and 
it  is  supposed  to  number  at  present  over  10,000  well-selected 
works.

THE    ATHENAEUM.  197 

The  Philadelphia  and  Loganian  libraries  contain,  united, 
about  60,000  volumes.  The  income  of  the  Institution  is 
$6,300 ;  $4,000  of  which  is  annually  appropriated  to  the  pur- 
chase of  additional  works.  The  Library  is  open  every  week- 
day, from  10  A.  M.,  until  sunset;  during  which  time,  strangers 
have  free  admission. 

In  examining  this  Library,  you  are  impressed  with  a  sense 
of  its  magnitude  and  importance.  Look  where  you  will,  you 
see  books  in  cases,  on  shelves,  in  boxes, — such  heaps  of  books, 
that  you  are  astonished  at  their  apparently  perplexing  and  un- 
accountable variety.  One  can  hardly  realize  the  vastness  of 
the  labour  that  provided  all  these  valuable  records.  L.  P. 
Smith  is  the  librarian. 

The  Athenaeum,  is  beautifully  situated  on  the  southeast 
corner  of  Sixth  and  Adelphi  Streets. 

This  Institution  owes  its  origin  to  that  taste  for  literary 
pursuits,  which  has  always,  to  a  great  extent,  characterized 
our  city.  In  the  year  1813,  a  few  young  men,  feeling  the 
want  of  a  convenient  place  of  common  resort,  in  which  their 
leisure  hours  could  be  passed  without  danger  to  their  morals 
or  tastes,  came  together  and  arranged  a  plan  for  the  establish- 
ment of  reading  rooms,  or  a  place  in  which  periodicals,  works 
of  all  descriptions,  books  of  immediate  interest,  of  reference 
and  information,  maps  and  charts,  could  be  read  and  consulted 
at  all  hours  of  the  day  and  evening.  The  efforts  of  these 
young  men  were  successful,  for  we  find  that  on  the  9  th  of 
February,  1814,  the  Athenaeum  was  organized,  and  articles  of 
association  adopted.  It  was  first  opened  to  the  public,  in  a 
room  over  the  book  store  at  the  southeast  corner  of  Chestnut 
and  Fourth  Streets.  Subsequently,  it  occupied  a  portion  of 
the  American  Philosophical   Society's  building,  Fifth  below 

Chestnut  Street.

EEHilp 


THE     A  T  H  E  X  2E  U  31. 


The  corner-stone  of  the  present  edifice  was  laid  on  the  1st 
of  November,  1845,  and  the  building  opened  on  the  18th  of 
October,  18-17.  As  viewed  from  Washington  Square,  the 
Athenaeum  has  a  chaste  and  beautiful  appearance.  The  whole 
structure  is  125  feet  on  Adelphi  Street,  and  50  feet  on  Sixth 
Street,  and  is  58  feet  high.  It  is  of  the  Italian  style  of  ar- 
chitecture, and  is  at  once  bold  and  imposing.  The  beautiful 
proportions  of  its  parts,  the  fine  details,  and  the  massive 
crowning  cornice,  give  it  an  air  of  stateliness  and  grandeur, 
most  impressive  as  a  piece  of  city  architecture. 

The  first  story  of  the  building  is  occupied  at  present  by  the 
Controllers  of  the  Public  Schools,  as  their  meeting-room  and 
offices,  and  the  private  office  of  Mr.  Barclay,  attorney.  The 
second  story  is  arranged  for  the  use  of  the  association,  and  is

ARTHUR'S  HOME  GAZETTE, 

FOR    18  52. 

THE  HOME  GAZETTE,  through  the  Editor's  untiring  efforts  to  pro- 
duce a  weekly  family  paper  combining  the  highest  degree  of  interest 
and  instruction,  with  an  entire 

FREEDOM  PROM  VULGARITY,  LOW  SLANG,  PROFANITY, 

or  anything  that  can  corrupt  or  deprave  the  mind,  has  already  gained  a 
wide  circulation,  and  won  the  fullest  confidence  of  a  virtuous  and  dis- 
criminating public.  In  announcing  the  Prospectus,  for  1852,  the 
publishers  have  little  to  say  beyond  what  has  already  been  said. 
They  have  given  to 

T.  S.  ARTHUR,  THE  EDITOR, 

entire  control  of  the  paper.  Not  a  line  goes  in  without  his  super- 
vision ;  and  he  is,  therefore,  responsible  for  all  that  appears  therein. 
So  that  just  the  same  confidence  felt  in  him  by  the  public,  as  a  sound 
and  safe  moral  teacher,  may  be  felt  in  his  "  Home  Gazette,"  which 
is  emphatically 

A  supporter  of  Religion  and  Virtue,  and  the  Conservator  of  Good 
Morals  and  Social  Well-being. 

In  the  original  literary  departmext,  no  magazine  in  the  country 
is  better  sustained  than  the  "Home  Gazette."  Besides  a  regular 
series  of  articles  from  many  of  the  best  writers  in  the  country, 

Nearly  all  that  the  Editor  writes  will  appear  first  ill  the 

*'  Home  Gazette." 

In  order  to  keep  the  columns  of  our  paper  perfectly  free  from  all 
that  may  injure  either  body  or  mind,  all  Medical  Advertisements  will  be 
excluded;  and  also,  all  advertisements  of  bad  books,  or  anything  that  can 
do  harm. 

The  Home  Gazette  is  printed  on  white  paper,  with  large  clear 
type.

divided  into  a  news-room;  a  library,  and  a  chess-room.  The 
news-room  fronts  on  Sixth  Street,  and  a  more  delightful  place 
to  pass  away  an  hour  cannot  be  imagined.  It  is  well  supplied 
with  the  principal  journals,  both  of  this  and  foreign  countries. 
The  library  is  a  large  and  convenient  room,  fronting  on  Adel- 
phi  Street,  neatly  fitted  up  with  book-cases.  It  contains  over 
12,000  volumes.  The  chess-room  is  an  anteroom  between  the 
two  larger  ones.     In  the  third  story,  is  the  Hall  of 

The  Historical  Society  of  Pennsylvania. — This  society 
was  instituted  for  the  purpose  of  collecting  and  preserving 
matters  connected  with  the  history  of  Pennsylvania.  The 
library  contains  1,728  volumes,  including  47  volumes  of  manu- 
scripts. Most  of  these  books  have  been  received  during  the 
last  five  years,  principally  by  donation.  It  is  open  on  the 
evenings  of  the  second  Monday  of  each  month,  and  is  accessi- 
ble to  the  members ;  but  only  by  courtesy  to  others. 

The  books  are  divided  into  ten  classes,  viz.,  history,  biogra- 
phy, manuscripts,  pamphlets,  periodicals,  voyages  and  travels, 
newspapers,  public  documents  of  Pennsylvania,  public  docu- 
ments of  the  United  States,  and  miscellaneous  works.  The 
Society  have  also  a  choice  collection  of  coins,  &amp;c. 

The  Academy  of  Natural  Sciences,  northwest  corner 
of  Broad  and  George  Streets.  This  noble  Institution  was 
founded  in  January,  1812,  and  incorporated  in  1817.  The 
first  meeting  was  composed  of  but  seven  gentlemen,  having 
for  their  object,  the  advancement  of  Natural  Science  in  all  its 
branches.  They  resolved,  at  this  primary  meeting,  to  assemble 
weekly,  for  the  purpose  of  conversing  on  scientific  subjects, 
and  thus  communicate  to  each  other  the  results  of  their 
reading,  observation,  and  reflection.  At  the  second  meeting, 
held  on  the  17th  of  March,  the  following  declaration  was  passed, 
fully  setting  forth  the  objects  of  the  association :  "We  will  con-

CHEAPEST  FAMILY  NEWSPAPER  IN  THE  WORLD  ! 

THE  DOLLAR  NEWSPAPER, 

AFFORDED  TO  SINGLE  SUBSCRIBERS 

AT  ONLY  ONE  DOLLAR  PER  YEAR. 

The  Dollar  Newspaper  is  now  in  the  ninth  year  of  its  existence, 
and  is  printed  on  a  large  imperial  sheet. 

AS    A    FAMILY    NEWSPAPER 

It  has  won  wide  fame,  being  devoted  to  all  the  interests  of  Trade  and 
Business,  to  Light  Literature,  and  to  the  various  matters  which  con- 
tribute to  the  formation  of  a  complete  Family  Fireside  Companion, 
in  which  amusement  and  instruction  predominate.  Its  Original 
Domestic  Stories  have  acquired  for  it  a  wide  popularity ;  and  to 
maintain  favour  in  this  respect,  arrangements  have  been  effected 
with  some  of  the  ablest  Story  Writers  in  the  country,  both  male  and 
female.  As  a  vehicle  of  the  latest  news,  it  possesses  a  worth  not 
exceeded  by  any  other  paper  of  its  character  in  the  United  States. 

FARMERS,    ATTENTION! 

No  other  Family  Newspaper  gives  so  much  attention  to  AGRICUL- 
TURAL SUBJECTS,  and  no  one,  it  is  believed,  publishes  weekly  so 
large  an  amount  of  original  matter  of  interest  to  Farmers.

Paper  in  the  country.

meetings  were  held  at  private  residences.  Subsequently  they 
were  enabled  to  obtain  a  room  in  North  Second  Street,  and  at 
a  still  later  period,  a  building  in  Arch  Street,  which  was 
occupied  as  the  Hall  of  the  Academy  until  they  removed  to 
the  present  building.  When  this  new  Hall  was  erected,  it 
was  well  adapted  to  its  purpose ;  but,  although  only  ten  years 
ago  it  was  considered  large  enough  to  accommodate  the  col- 
lections for  half  a  century,  it  is  now  crowded  to  excess. 

The  library  contains  a  collection  of  over  126,000  volumes,

and  nearly  500  maps,  charts,  &amp;c,  exclusive  of  periodicals,  serials, 
and  pamphlets.  The  Library,  occupying  an  apartment  on  the 
ground  floor  of  the  Hall,  is  about  45  feet  by  28,  and  14  feet 
high,  with  a  gallery  on  all  its  sides.  The  books  are  arranged 
according  to  subjects.  This  Library  is  particularly  rich  in  all 
departments  of  Natural  History.  In  ornithology  it  is  quite 
complete.  In  this  department,  at  least,  it  is  said  to  be  the 
most  extensive  in  the  United  States,  if  not  in  the  world. 

For  these  magnificent  collections,  the  Academy  is  mainly 
indebted  to  the  munificence  of  three  gentlemen, — Mr.  Maclure, 
Dr.  R.  E.  Griffiths,  and  Dr.  T.  B.  Wilson.  Mr.  Maclure 
presented  5,233  volumes,  embracing  some  of  the  most  costly 
works  of  natural  history,  the  fine  arts,  and  antiquities.  In  it 
too,  are  found  Bonaparte's  great  work  on  Egypt,  Pirenesi's 
Italy,  and  the  splendid  natural  historical  illustrations  of  Be- 
doute,  Humboldt,  Poli,  and  many  others. 

The  museum  is  divided  into  three  cabinets,  viz.,  Zoology, 
Botany,  and  Geology  and  Mineralogy.  It  is  also  said  to  be  the 
best  in  the  United  States. 

The  attention  required  by  the  zoological  preparations,  and 
the  space  necessary  to  their  proper  exhibition,  are  obstacles 
against  which  this  Society  has  been  inadequately  provided ; 
hence  we  find  the  collection-  of  quadrupeds  comparatively 
small. 

The  department  of  Comparative  Anatomy  embraces  some 
highly  interesting  subjects  ;  among  which  we  may  particularize 
the  perfect  skeleton  of  the  Indian  Bhinoceros,  brought  from 
the  Himalaya  Mountains,  by  Dr.  Burrows.  It  also  contains 
the  late  Dr.  Morton's  celebrated  cabinet  of  crania,  the  most 
extensive  in  the  world. 

In  examining  this  collection,  we  were  astonished  at  the 
immense  variety  displayed.  What  a  gathering !  Here,  for  aught 
we  know,  may  be  the  "cranium"  of  some  learned  Theban  or

Babylonian,  who  three  thousand  years  ago  delighted  in  the 
study  of  Natural  Science ;  and  there,  perhaps  that  of  a  cour- 
tier,— 

"  Once  doomed  to  kneel 
At  Pharaoh's  throne,  and  anxious  tremors  feel; 
And  this,  that  of  a  priest,  who  often  taught  the  crowd 
With  words  of  eloquence,  whilst  listening  votaries  bowed; 
Or  perhaps,  he,  face  to  face,  saw  Moses,  when  his  sacred  rod 
Shook  o'er  the  guilty  land  the  plagues  of  God. 
This,  may  have  been  a  sage;  and  this  hollow  skull 
Was  peopled  once  with  thoughts,  with  wit  and  wisdom  full ; 
Yes!  through  these  socket-holes,  the  curious  eye 
Scanned  the  heavens'  wide  arch,  and  read  the  spangled  sky. 
And  this,  alas!  the  remnant  of  some  beauteous  one, 
That  once  amid  the  halls  of  Memphis  shone. 
Three  thousand  years  ago !     Ah,  years  are  swift  and  brief, 
Since  this  was,  perhaps,  the  head  of  a  lordly  chief. 
Poor  skulls!  whilst  gazing  on  you  now, 
Ambition  well  may  sigh,  and  Wisdom  bow  ; 
Though  mute,  you  do  not  teach  the  less — 
A  sermon  read  we  in  thy  ghastliness!" 

Perhaps  no  one  branch  of  natural  science  has  been  more 
assiduously  cultivated  by  the  members  of  this  Academy  than 
Ornithology.  This  collection  is  also  said  to  be  without  a 
rival  in  Europe  or  America.  It  contains  over  25,000  speci- 
mens, beautifully  displayed  in  glass  cases.  The  natural  tints 
of  the  feathers  are  preserved  in  all  their  freshness,  and  the 
character  and  natural  expression  of  each  individual  are  fully  re- 
tained. We  never  saw  finer  specimens  of  the  art  of  taxidermy, 
than  those  under  notice.  The  collection  of  humming-birds  is 
exceedingly  brilliant ;  the  eye  in  examining  them  is  com- 
pletely dazzled  by  the  kaleidoscope-like  glitter  of  purple  and 
gold,  of  crimson  and  blue.  The  collections  of  eggs,  and 
of  nests  of  birds,  are  also  very  extensive;  so  are  those  of  fishes, 
reptiles,  Crustacea,  insects,  &amp;c. 

The  Cabinet  of  Botany  is  particularly  rich ;  the  Herbarium 
embracing  over  30.000  specimens  of  plants,  of  which  no  less

than  23,000  were  bequeathed  by  the  late  Mr.  L.  D.  Yon 
Schweinitz.  These  were  the  acquisition  of  a  single  indi- 
vidual, during  a  period  of  forty  years  devoted  to  this  favour- 
ite science.  The  Academy  also  possesses  the  valuable  Herba- 
rium of  Mr.  T.  Nuttall.  This  gentleman  was  for  many  years 
ardently  engaged  in  botanical  researches,  in  pursuit  of  which 
he  traversed  the  United  States  and  territories,  from  the  At- 
lantic to  the  Pacific,  and  from  Maine  to  Mexico. 

The  Geological  series  is  also  very  complete.  It  comprises 
over  seven  thousand  specimens,  of  which  a  large  portion  are 
fossil  organic  remains  of  animals  and  plants. 

The  department  of  Mineralogy  is  likewise  full.  The  principal 
portion  of  this  collection  was  contributed  by  the  late  Mr. 
Maclure,  an  early  friend  and  ardent  supporter  of  the  Institu- 
tion; indeed,  to  this  gentleman's  talent,  generosity,  and  influ- 
ence the  Academy  owes,  in  a  great  measure,  its  permanence 
and  prosperity.  Geology  was  the  engrossing  study  of  his  mind, 
and  he  pursued  it  with  an  enthusiasm  and  success  to  which 
time,  toil,  and  distance,  presented  but  temporary  obstacles. 
He  went  forth,  with  his  hammer  in  his  hand  and  his  wallet 
on  his  shoulder,  pursuing  his  researches  often  amid  pathless 
tracts  and  dreary  wastes,  until  he  crossed  and  recrossed  the 
Alleghany  Mountains  no  less  than  fifty  times.  Some  of  his 
adventures  were,  in  after  years,  the  theme  of  amusing  anecdote. 
When  travelling  in  a  remote  district,  the  inhabitants  seeing 
him  battering  the  rocks,  supposed  him  to  be  a  lunatic  escaped 
from  confinement;  and  on  one  occasion,  the  inmates  of  a  public 
house,  on  his  approach,  took  refuge  indoors,  and  refused  him 
admittance,  until  convinced  that  he  was  really  of  sound  mind. 

This  Institution  has  added  largely  to  the  stock  of  science, 
and  now  enjoys  a  high  and  well-deserved  reputation.  The 
Hall  is  a  very  beautiful  building.  Visiters  are  admitted

METALLIC  SKELETON  ARTIFICIAL  LEG,

AND 

IMPROVED  ANATOMICAL  MACHINERY 
For  the  Treatment  of  Deformities. 

The  Metallic  Skeleton  Limb  is  light, 
neat,  strong,  and  durable.  It  is  con- 
structed of  steel  ribs,  and  rings,  or  bands, 
united  together  upon  the  principle  of  a 
lattice  bridge,  or  arch,  one  piece  bracing 
and  sustaining  the  other,  rendering  it 
capable  of  bearing  any  required  weight; 
the  socket  or  receptacle  of  the  stump 
being  open  below,  allows  a  free  circula- 
tion of  air,  keeping  it  always  cool  and 
healthy,  thereby  preventing  ulceration, 
which  is  almost  invariably  the  conse- 
quence when  the  stump  is  confined  in 
air-tight  sockets. 

The  motions  of  the  knee  and  ankle 
joints  approach  so  near  to  nature  as  to 
render  it  almost  impossible  to  distinguish 
it  from  the  natural  limb;  and  it  can  be 
adapted  to  every  form  of  amputation,  and 
worn  without  the  least  difficulty. 

No  stronger  proof  can  be  given  of  its 
superiority  than  the  fact  that  it  has  been 
examined  and  approved  of  by  all  of  the 
eminent  Surgeons  and  Physicians  in 
Philadelphia  and  elsewhere,  to  whom 
we  take  pleasure  in  referring  at  all  times. 
The  Massachusetts  Charitable  Mecha- 
nics' Association,  the  American  Institute, 
New  York,  and  the  Franklin  Institute, 
Philadelphia,  have  awarded  Silver  Medals 
to  Yerger  &amp;  Urd,  for  the  Skeleton  Leg 
and  Deformity  Apparatus  constructed  by 
them.  The  public  are  cautioned  against 
a  certain  party  who  is  endeavouring  in 
vain  to  bolster  up  his  shackling  business 
by  circulating  a  petty  species  of  slander, 
which  has  been  justly  refuted  by  an 
overwhelming  patronage  from  those  he  expected  to  win  by  pursuing  a  course  too  far 
beneath  the  character  of  a  man  for  us  to  notice  in  detail. 

Every  information  in  reference  to  the  Metallic  Leg,  Ankle  Supporter,  and  Instru- 
ments for  Deformity,  will  be  given  on  application,  personally  or  by  letter  (post  paid),

THE  MERCANTILE  LIBRARY. 


The  Mercantile  Library  is  situated  on  the  southeast 
corner  of  Fifth  and  Library  Streets.  This  Institution  was 
founded  for  the  benefit  of  the  young  men  employed  in  the  va- 
rious mercantile  establishments  in  the  city.  It  was  opened  in 
temporary  rooms,  on  the  19th  of  January,  1821,  in  the  second 
story  of  No.  100  Chestnut  Street.  The  present  new  and  really 
elegant  building,  was  erected  in  1844-45,  at  a  cost  of 
$23,199  42,  including  furniture,  &amp;c.  This  building  is  unsur- 
passed for  convenience  of  arrangement,  and  adaptation  to  the 
purpose  for  which  it  was  designed,  and  it  is  justly  deemed  one 
of  the  chief  ornaments  of  the  city.  The  Library  contains  up- 
wards of  10,000  volumes  of  well-selected  books.  The  reading- 
rooms  are  always  well  attended,  and  the  books  have  an  un- 
ceasing circulation.  To  all  who  may  have  made  use  of  it,  the 
"  Mercantile"  has  been  a  rich  treasure,  a  pure  and  constant 
source  of  pleasure  and  improvement.     In  its  list  of  members

may  be  found  a  large  proportion  of  our  most  honoured  mer- 
chants, who  best  enjoy  and  use  the  fruits  of  their  industry. 

The  Franklin  Institute,  is  a  valuable  association,  or- 
ganized, as  stated  in  its  constitution,  "  For  the  promotion  and 
encouragement  of  Manufactures  and  the  Mechanic  and  Use- 
ful Arts,  by  the  establishment  of  popular  lectures  on  the 
sciences  connected  with  them ;  by  the  formation  of  a  library, 
reading-room,  and  a  cabinet  of  models  and  minerals ;  by  offer- 
ing premiums  on  all  subjects  deemed  worthy  of  encourage- 
ment ;  by  examining  all  new  inventions  submitted  to  them ; 
and  by  such  other  means  as  they  may  judge  expedient." 
This  Institution  was  incorporated  on  the  30th  of  March,  1824. 
The  members  are  manufacturers,  mechanics,  artisans,  and 
persons  friendly  to  the  mechanic  arts.  The  Hall  of  the  Insti- 
tute, located  on  Seventh,  above  Chestnut  Street,  is  a  plain  and 
substantial  edifice,  having  a  spacious  lecture-room  on  the  first 
story,  in  which,  during  the  winter  season,  lectures  are  deli- 
vered on  mechanics,  chemistry,  and  other  sciences,  to  large 
and  intelligent  audiences.  The  reading-room,  library,  and 
cabinets  of  models  and  minerals,  are  in  the  second  story.  The 
library,  though  not  large,  is  valuable ;  it  contains  about  6,000 
volumes,  principally  mechanical  and  scientific  works.  The 
reading-room  is  well  attended,  and  liberally  supplied  with 
periodicals  and  newspapers.  In  October,  of  each  year,  this 
Institution  has  an  extensive  exhibition  of  American  manufac- 
tures. The  extent  and  interest  of  these  exhibitions  cannot  be 
described,  or  their  importance  to  the  industry  and  skill  of 
our  mechanics  over-estimated.  The  exhibition  is  always  an 
object  of  attraction,  alike  to  citizens  and  strangers.  It  is  ge- 
nerally held  in  the  spacious  saloons  of  the  Museum  Building, 
corner  of  Ninth  and  George  Streets. 

The  Journal  of  the  Franklin  Institute,  published  by  this 
Association,  is  the  oldest  extant  mechanical  periodical  pub-

lisbed  in  America.  The  deservedly  high  reputation,  both  at 
home  and  abroad,  which  the  Journal  has  acquired  and  sus- 
tains, has  given  it  an  exchange  list  and  a  circulation  of  the 
best  character.  It  contains  notices  of  all  the  patents  issued 
in  the  United  States,  together  with  a  vast  amount  of  informa- 
tion on  Mechanics,  Chemistry,  Civil  Engineering,  &amp;c,  &amp;c. 

Library  of  the  Law  Association  of  Philadelphia. — 
In  the  year  1802,  a  few  gentlemen  of  the  bar  associated  them- 
selves for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  a  Law  Library.  They 
succeeded  by  degrees  in  forming  a  collection,  which,  with  the 
limited  number  of  law  books  then  extant,  was  all  that  was 
wanted.  With  the  increasing  number  of  reports  in  modern 
times,  the  library,  as  originally  organized,  fell  very  far  be- 
hind the  professional  requirements  of  the  day;  and  in  Septem- 
ber, 1841,  an  effort  was  made  to  enlarge  the  collection,  and  to 
place  it  upon  such  a  basis  as  should  make  it  worthy  of  the  bar 
to  which  it  belonged.  Between  the  15th  of  October,  1841, 
and  the  1st  of  March,  1850,  there  has  been  expended  by  the 
Society,  in  the  purchase  of  new  books,  the  sum  of  $9,583  72, 
exclusive  of  $865  87,  paid  for  binding,  &amp;c. 

The  collection,  we  are  informed,  is  now  complete  in  all  those 
departments  usually  required  in  the  practice  of  law.  There 
exists  in  it,  a  series  of  all  the  English,  Irish,  and  American 
reports, — a  department  in  which,  we  believe,  no  other  library, 
either  in  Great  Britain  or  the  United  States,  is  equally 
perfect.  The  department  of  text-books  is  also  good ;  and,  in 
addition  to  complete  collections  of  the  British  statutes  at  large, 
and  of  the  acts,  both  of  our  state  and  federal  legislature,  in 
their  authoritative,  unabridged  condition,  there  will  be  found 
upon  the  shelves  of  this  Library  such  digests  and  works  of 
general  jurisprudence  as  have  obtained  with  the  profession 
any  title  to  authority.  As  a  means  of  professional  culture, 
and  of  extending  among  the  bar  a  knowledge    of  the  judicial

decisions  of  England,  and  of  the  United  States,  this  Library 
affords  all  that  is  as  yet  practicable,  and  much  of  all  that  can 
at  any  time  be  desired. 

The  Library  occupies  a  room  in  the  second  story  of  the  old 
Congress  Hall,  or  County  Court-house,  Sixth  and  Chestnut 
Streets.  It  is  open  daily,  from  10  A.  M.  to  3  p.  M.,  and  from 
4  J  o'clock  until  sunset. 

The  College  of  Physicians,  was  chartered  on  the  26th 
of  March,  1789.  Its  objects  are,  "to  advance  the  science  of 
medicine,  and  thereby  to  lessen  human  misery,  by  investi- 
gating the  diseases  and  remedies  which  are  peculiar  to  this 
country ;  by  observing  the  effect  of  different  seasons,  climates, 
and  situations,  upon  the  human  body;  by  recording  the 
changes  which  are  produced  in  diseases  by  the  progress  of 
agriculture,  arts,  population,  and  manners ;  by  searching  for 
medicines  in  the  American  woods,  waters,  and  in  the  bowels 
of  the  earth;  by  enlarging  the  avenues  to  knowledge  from  the 
discoveries  and  publications  of  foreign  countries;  and  by  cul- 
tivating order  and  uniformity  in  the  practice  of  physic. " 

The  College  consists  of  Fellows  and  Associates.  The  Fel- 
lows must  be  practitioners  of  medicine,  residing  in  the  city  or 
the  incorporated  districts  of  Philadelphia,  and  must  be  over 
twenty-four  years  of  age.  The  Associates  are  distinguished 
practitioners  residing  without  the  above  limits.  No  person 
who  gives  his  support  to  any  system  of  practice  which  is  sus- 
tained by  efforts  to  weaken  or  diminish  public  confidence  in 
the  science  of  medicine,  or  in  the  medical  profession,  or  who, 
by  advertisement,  announces  himself  as  possessing  superior 
qualifications  in  the  treatment  of  diseases,  or  of  a  particular 
disease,  or  who  holds  a  patent,  or  part  of  a  patent,  for  a  surgical 
instrument,  or  gives  a  prescription  to  any  apothecary,  which 
he  refuses  to  give  to  other  apothecaries,  or  who  deals  in  secret 
medicines,  or  publicly  recommends  them,  can  be  elected  either

after  his  election,  be  so  engaged,  he  immediately  forfeits  his 
rights  as  such. 

The  Association  publishes  a  summary  of  its  transactions 
every  three  months.  These  transactions  embrace  all  written 
communications  presented  to  the  College  which  the  publishing 
committee  may  select,  a  statement  of  all  the  facts  relating  to 
the  science  of  medicine,  surgery,  or  obstetrics,  communicated 
verbally  to  the  College  by  its  Fellows,  and  an  abstract  of  all 
discussions  upon  subjects  of  general  interest  which  take  place 
at  the  meetings  of  the  Society.  This  periodical  is  one  of  the 
most  valuable  medical  works  of  the  day. 

The  Library  op  the  German  Society,  contains  a  col- 
lection of  about  8,000  volumes,  of  both  English  and  German 
works.     The  Hall  is  in  Seventh  below  Market  Street. 

The  Library  of  the  University  of  Pennsylvania, 
is  located  in  the  University  Buildings,  Ninth  below  Market 
Street.  This  Library  originated  by  private  donations  from 
the  friends  of  the  Institution;  among  whom  the  Rev.  Wil- 
liam Smith,  the  first  Provost  of  the  College  and  Academy, 
and  Dr.  McDowell,  one  of  his  successors,  deserve  to  be  parti- 
cularly remembered.  During  the  war  of  Independence,  the 
Library  was  enriched  by  a  donation  of  books  from  Louis  XVI. 
of  France.  These  books  were  printed  at  the  royal  printing 
office,  and  consist  principally  of  works  on  mathematics  and  on 
natural  history,  among  which  is  a  collection  of  M.  BufFon's, 
together  with  some  Byzantine  historians.  They  are  carefully 
preserved,  and  will,  it  is  hoped,  long  remain  a  memorial  of  the 
generosity  of  that  unfortunate  monarch.  The  Library  at  pre- 
sent, contains  about  5,000  volumes. 

The  Library  of  the  Pennsylvania  Hospital. — The 
first  medical  work  possessed  by  this  Institution,  was  Louis's 
"  History  of  Materia  Medica,"  presented  in  1762.     It  was

subsequently  determined  to  demand  a  fee  from  students  attend- 
ing the  wards,  and  to  appropriate  the  funds  so  obtained  to  the 
founding  of  a  Medical  Library. 

The  first  catalogue  published,  which  was  in  1790,  contained 
21  folios,  79  quartos,  341  octavos,  and  89  duodecimos,  a  total 
of  528  volumes.  The  increasing  number  of  students  from 
that  time,  has  afforded  a  fund  for  the  steady  increase  of  the 
library.  For  several  years  the  books  were  selected  and  pur- 
chased by  the  celebrated  Lettsom,  who  enriched  the  collection 
with  many  valuable  donations.  In  the  year  1800,  Sarah 
Lane  presented  142  volumes  of  medical  books,  some  of  which 
are  of  great  rarity ;  and  on  the  decease  of  Dr.  B.  S.  Barton, 
his  extensive  and  choice  collection  of  works  on  natural  history, 
was  obtained  by  purchase  from  his  widow.  At  present,  the 
library  contains  over  10,000  volumes,  occupying  a  large  and 
elegant  room  in  the  Hospital.  The  works  are  mostly  medical, 
and  those  pertaining  to  kindred  sciences.  In  these  depart- 
ments it  is,  probably,  the  most  extensive  in  the  country. 

The  Apprentices'  Library,  southwest  corner  of  Arch 
and  Fifth  Streets.  Among  the  many  organizations  for  the 
diffusion  of  knowledge  in  this  city,  not  among  the  least  is  this 
excellent  institution.  The  Apprentices'  Library  was  founded, 
by  voluntary  contributions  from  our  benevolent  citizens,  in 
1819.  It  now  contains  over  12,000  volumes  of  well-selected 
books,  embracing  generally  the  most  approved  and  standard 
works.  The  usefulness  of  this  institution  can  only  be  esti- 
mated by  seeing  the  number  of  young  persons  who  seek  its 
treasures ;  upwards  of  1200  boys  and  600  girls  now  partake  of 
its  benefits. 

The  Friends'  Library,  Race  Street  below  Fifth.  This 
Institution  loans  books  to  any  person,  no  matter  what  their 
creed,  nation,  or  colour  may  be,  on  producing  a  certificate  of

SPRING    GARDEN    INSTITUTE.  225 

the  Apprentices'  Library,  are  the  only  institutions  of  this  kind 
in  our  city.  This  ought  not  to  be.  Free  libraries  are  of  the 
highest  importance  in  a  community  like  that  of  Philadelphia, 
for  they  would  give  to  the  poor,  to  a  great  extent,  the  master- 
key  of  self-education.  It  is  useless  to  say  that  books  are 
cheap;  cheap  though  they  be,  they  are  dear  to  those  whose 
toil  scarcely  suffices  to  procure  their  daily  living.  The  founders 
and  supporters  of  the  above-mentioned  institutions,  are  en- 
titled to  all  praise.  We  hope  that  ere  long  others  will  "  Go 
and  do  likewise." 

Since  writing  the  above,  we  have  the  pleasure  of  noticing 
another  shrine  to  Knowledge.  Spring  G-arden  is  moving  in 
the  good  cause.  The  citizens  of  that  flourishing  district  have 
established 

The  Spring  Garden  Institute. — Here,  in  truth,  will  be 
a  free  reading-room  and  library,  of  the  most  approved  kind. 
The  spirit  with  which  this  enterprise  has  been  undertaken  is 
admirable.  Its  friends  are  earnest,  truth-seeking  men,  who 
not  only  talk,  but  labour.  Can  their  efforts  be  otherwise  than 
successful  ? 

This  new  structure — of  which  our  illustration  is  a  correct 
and  beautiful  view — will  be  an  ornament  to  its  vicinity,  Broad 
and  Spring  Garden  Streets. 

In  addition  to  the  above  Libraries  and  Associations,  there 
are  numerous  minor  institutions  and  clubs,  &amp;c,  many  of  which 
have  a  choice  collection  of  books  for  the  use  of  their  own  mem- 
bers. Nor  should  we  overlook  the  Southwark  Library 
Company,  in  Second  below  German  Street,  the  Northern 
Liberties  Franklin  Library  Company,  in  Second  near 
Tammany  Street,  the  Jefferson  Library  and  Literary 
Association,  corner  of  Brown  and  Second  Streets,  and  the 
Free  Reading-Room  Association,  of  Spring  Garden.

We  learn,  also,  that  the  Commissioners  of  Kensington  have 
appropriated  a  lot  of  ground  as  a  site  for  the  erection  of  a 
Hall,  to  be  designated  The  Kensington  Institute.  The 
establishment  of  this  praiseworthy  enterprise  is  yet  in  its  in- 
fancy. We  hope  that  the  example  of  Spring  Garden  will  urge 
on  the  good  work,  not  only  in  Kensington,  but  in  all  our  dis- 
tricts. Such  institutions  will  go  far  to  refine  and  elevate  the

THE    FINE    ARTS.  229 

by  cultivating  the  Arts  of  Design  in  connexion  with  the  in- 
dustrial arts. 

Young  women,  whose  minds  are  sufficiently  cultivated  to 
enter  upon  a  course  of  instruction,  may  freely  come  forward 
and  enjoy  the  advantages  of  this  school.  The  charges  are 
extremely  moderate,  considering  the  benefits  to  be  derived. 

The  School  of  Design  will  mark,  it  is  hoped,  a  new  era  in 
our  manufactures.  In  Europe,  signal  advantages  have  been 
derived  for  the  arts,  from  a  close  alliance  between  the  useful 
and  the  ornamental.  The  silk  and  porcelain  of  France,  the 
iron  and  glass  of  Grermany,  are  instances  of  the  manner  in 
which  articles  of  use  and  luxury  can  acquire  increased  attrac- 
tion and  value  from  tasteful  decoration  or  elegant  form.  The 
care  with  which,  in  those  countries,  the  Arts  of  Design  have 
long  been  fostered,  has  secured  a  market  for  their  fabrics,  in 
certain  branches  of  industry,  which  until  recently  was  without 
a  rival. 

The  importance  of  this  subject  to  our  manufacturers,  cannot 
be  over-estimated ;  for,  unless  as  Americans,  we  can  compete 
in  matters  of  taste  with  European  artists,  we  must  for  ever 
be  subject  to  the  mortification  of  following  where  we  should 
lead.  Then,  gentlemen,  look  to  it !  Avail  yourselves  of  the 
immense  advantages  to  your  interests  here  offered,  by  thus 
bringing  the  Arts  of  Design  within  your  reach,  while  at  the 
same  time  you  may  enjoy  the  privilege  of  cherishing  a  class  of 
your  countrywomen  every  way  entitled  to  the  highest  respect 
and  regard. 

The  School  is  located  at  No.  70  Walnut  Street.

ACADEMY     OF     THE     FINE     ARTS.  231 

The  Pennsylvania  Academy  of  the  Fine  Arts,  lo- 
cated in  Chestnut  Street,  between  Tenth  and  Eleventh  Streets, 
is  the  oldest  and  perhaps  the  most  important  institution  of  the 
kind  in  the  United  States. 

It  was  organized  in  1807,  by  joint  stock  subscription,  the 
shares  in  the  corporation  being  then  fixed  at  fifty  dollars  each, 
subject  to  an  annual  contribution  of  two  dollars,  entitling  each 
stockholder  to  free  admission  at  all  times,  within  the  hours 
appointed  for  public  exhibition.  The  shares  are  now  fixed  at 
thirty  dollars  each,  which  includes  a  commutation  of  all 
annual  dues.  The  stockholders  become  joint  owners  in  the 
property  of  the  Institution,  the  estimated  value  of  which  has 
been  recently  ascertained  to  amount  to  $34,955. 

Among  the  works  of  art  which  belong  to  the  xlcademy  are 
the  following  rare  and  important  sculptures.  Hero  and 
Leander,  a  group  in  marble,  by  Steinhauser.  Bacchantes, 
a  pair  in  marble,  by  Cerrachi.  Son  of  Niobe,  in  marble, 
from  the  antique.  Commodus,  a  bust,  in  marble,  from  the 
antique.  Diana,  in  marble,  by  Steinhauser.  Antinous,  in 
marble,  from  the  antique.  Venus  de  Medici,  in  marble,  by 
Canova.  The  Gate  of  the  Baptistery  of  St.  John,  at 
Florence,  a  cast  from  the  original,  by  Lorenzo  Grhiberti ;  and 
marble  busts  of  Washington,  Franklin,  Lafayette, 
Hamilton,  Allston,  Clay,  Napoleon,  Biddle,  and  Sir 
Benjamin  "West. 

The  paintings  comprise  the  most  valuable  collection  in  this 
country,  among  which  are  the  following  chef -cV oeuv res. 

Washington,  a  full  length,  by  Gilbert  Stuart;  Lafayette, 
a  full  length,  by  Thomas  Sully ;  Jackson,  a  full  length  by 
Thomas  Sully;  Patrick  Lyon,  a  full  length,  by  John  Neagle, 
Death  on  the  Pale  Horse,  by  Sir  Benjamin  West;  Dead

ART    UNION  —  GRAPHIC    ASSOCIATION.  233 

The  annual  exhibitions  commence  in  May.  Admission, 
twenty-five  cents,  or  fifty  cents  for  a  season  ticket. 

The  present  officers  are,  Joseph  R.  Ingersoll,  President ; 
Hyman  Gratz,  Treasurer;  John  T.  Lewis,  Secretary,  and 
Eliza  Suss,  Janitress. 

The  Art  Union  of  Philadelphia,  located  in  Chestnut 
Street  between  Eighth  and  Ninth  Streets,  is  an  institution 
of  considerable  importance,  affording,  as  it  does  by  its  free 
gallery,  a  place  of  public  resort  for  strangers,  and  citizens,  at 
all  seasons. 

The  plan  upon  which  it  is  managed  differs  entirely  from  all 
other  Art  Unions  in  the  United  States.  The  yearly  payment 
of  five  dollars  entitles  each  subscriber  to  membership,  which 
includes  the  right  of  voting,  the  ownership  of  the  annual  en- 
gravings, and  a  chance  in  the  allotment  of  prize  certificates, 
with  which  works  of  American  Art  may  be  purchased  in  any 
part  of  the  country.  The  distribution  of  the  prizes  takes 
place  annually  on  the  evening  of  the  last  week-day  of  the  year. 

The  gallery  is  opened  to  the  free  admission  of  the  public 
every  day,  Sundays  excepted,  and  is  brilliantly  illuminated  in 
the  evenings.  The  use  of  this  gallery  is  made  free  to  all 
Artists  for  the  exhibition  and  sale  of  their  productions. 

Although  the  gallery  is  capable  of  containing  more  than 
one  hundred  and  fifty  paintings  at  one  time,  it  is  yet  estimated 
to  exhibit  over  one  thousand  different  original  pictures  in  the 
course  of  every  year — the  wall  being  re-hung  once  in  every 
month. 

The  present  officers  are,  Henry  C.  Carey,  President;  Ed- 
ward P.  Mitchell,  Treasurer ;  George  "W.  Dewey,  Corre- 
sponding Secretary ;  Edward  F.  Dennison,  Actuary. 

The  Graphic  Association  of  Philadelphia,  is  an  in-

THE   PRESS. 

The  achievements  of  the  last  fifty  years  have  been  such  that 
no  local  or  temporary  interest  can  satisfy  the  mind ;  every- 
thing is  conducted  on  a  grand  scale.  The  extension  of  educa- 
tion, the  progress  of  science,  the  facilities  of  communication 
and  intercourse  between  nations,  and,  above  all,  the  freedom 
of  the  Press,  and  its  consequent  wide  and  rapid  circulation  of 
news,  have  served  to  produce  this  extent  of  thought  and  pur- 
pose. In  the  United  States  the  Press  is  supremely  important. 
The  affairs  of  the  republic  are  debated,  not  only  in  Congress, 
but  in  the  journals  of  the  day ;  thus  enabling  the  far-off  dweller

on  the  shores  of  the  Pacific  to  canvass  the  affairs  of  his  govern- 
ment equally  as  well  as  the  citizen  in  Washington.  The  Church, 
in  the  olden  time,  furnished  the  man  of  talent  with  the  means 
of  procuring  power  and  influence ;  but  for  the  man  of  talent 
and  tact  now,  the  arena  of  the  Press  may  well  be  an  ample  one, 
where  influences  the  most  mighty  can  be  obtained  over  the 
heads  and  hearts  of  millions.     Can  ambition  seek  for  more  ? 

In  no  part  of  the  country,  indeed  we  may  say  in  the  world, 
does  the  Press  maintain  a  higher  tone,  or  is  more  characterized 
by  originality,  courtesy,  and  propriety,  than  in  Philadelphia : 
controlled  as  it  is,  for  the  most  part,  by  men  of  high  social 
position,  its  columns  are  rarely  stained  by  those  "  exhibitions" 
which,  in  some  other  cities,  so  often  outrage  the  public  sense. 
In  our  political  papers,  influenced  by  party  interest  and  party 
spirit,  the  decorum  of  personal  intercourse  is  invariably  ob- 
served, and  it  is  seldom,  indeed,  that  the  editor  forgets  in  his 
writings  the  respect  due  to  the  profession,  and  that  he  too  is  a 
gentleman. 

The  activity  and  power  of  the  newspaper  press  of  the  United 
States  date  their  origin  from  the  Revolutionary  War.  Pre- 
vious to  that  great  event,  they  were  few  in  number,  and  barren 
of  that  interest,  vigour,  and  originality,  so  important  a  feature 
in  those  of  the  present  day.  The  Home  Government  and  the 
United  Colonies,  having  determined  to  settle  their  dispute  by 
arms,  both  appealed  to  the  people.  Each,  no  doubt,  had  their 
partisans ;  but  there  were  many  independent  or  indifferent  per- 
sons, whose  support  was  valuable.  Then  it  was  that  the  Press 
entered  into  the  strife,  and  assumed  that  direction  of  public 
opinion,  which  has  continued  ever  since,  and  forms  so  remark-

The  first  public  journal  published  in  Philadelphia  was  "  The

number,  the  only  one  we  believe  extant,  is  preserved  in  the 
Philadelphia  Library.  In  1723,  Samuel  Keimer,  rendered 
famous  by  the  wit  and  sarcasm  of  Benjamin  Franklin,  estab- 
lished the  second  paper.  It  was  entitled  "The  Pennsylvania 
Gazette,  and  Universal  Instructor  in  all  the  Arts  and  Sciences/' 
This  paper  subsequently  fell  into  the  hands  of  Benjamin 
Franklin,  under  whose  management  it  rapidly  rose  in  public 
favour.  It  continued  for  a  long  series  of  years  one  of  the 
principal  papers  of  the  day.  The  first  daily  newspaper  pub- 
lished in  the  United  States,  was  "  The  Pennsylvania  Packet, 
or  General  Advertiser."  It  was  first  issued  weekly  in  1771, 
and  became,  in  1784,  a  daily  paper.  The  Packet  eventually 
passed  into  the  hands  of  Mr.  Zachariah  Poulson,  by  whom  it 
was  continued  under  the  name  of  "  The  American  Daily  Ad- 
vertiser." In  1840,  it  merged  into  the  present  North  Ame- 
rican.

Monthly. — The  Magazines  of  Philadelphia  have  long  re-

and  to  the  city.  The  contributions  to  these  periodicals  have 
always  been  of  a  superior  character. 

The  first  established  of  these  valuable  monthlies  is 

Godey's  Magazine. — The  January  number,  for  this  year, 
is  a  capital  one.  The  enterprising  publisher  is  determined  not 
to  be  surpassed  either  in  the  quantity  or  quality  of  its  literary 
matter  and  embellishments. 

Graham's  Magazine  also  commences  the  year  1852  richly 
freighted  with  choice  articles  from  well-known  writers  in  this 
country.     The  execution  of  the  illustrations  cannot  be  excelled. 

Sartain's  Magazine  is  likewise  a  valuable  periodical. 
Though  comparatively  a  new  publication,  it  already  receives  a 
liberal  support.     We  know  of  none  that  more  deserves  it. 

Peterson's  Magazine  has  commenced  the  year  1852  in  a 
commendable  spirit.  Its  pages  are  always  filled  with  a  choice 
stock  of  reading. 

Journal  of  the  Franklin  Institute.  This  is  a  truly 
valuable  work,  devoted  to  the  Mechanical  and  Physical  Sciences, 
Civil  Engineering,  the  Arts  and  Manufactures,  and  the  Re- 
cords of  American  and  Foreign  Patented  Inventions.  No 
mechanic  ought  to  be  without  the  Journal.

practical  results  arrived  at  by  the  learned  of  the  profession. 
To  such,  this  publication  must  prove  peculiarly  acceptable, 
inasmuch  as  it  places  them  in  possession  of  the  knowledge  of 
the  day,  while  it  saves  them  both  time  and  money,  and  enables 
them  to  see  at  a  glance,  what  works  are  worthy  of  perusal  or 
purchase. 

The  Home,  the  School,  and  the  Church;  or,  The 
Presbyterian  Education  Repository.  This  is  a  sterling 
work,  and  oneswhich  would  reflect  credit  on  any  age  or  country. 
It  is  divided  into  three  harmonious  departments,  the  first  being 
devoted  to  the  advantages,  the  responsibilities,  encouragements, 
obligations,  and  principles  of  home  culture.  The  second  in- 
cludes all  that  belongs  to  Christian  education  in  schools, 
academies,  colleges,  and  theological  seminaries.  The  last  de- 
partment is  devoted  to  the  interests  of  the  Church.

the  American  Philosophical  Society,  and  The  Transac-

CHAPTER  VII. 

BENEVOLENT  INSTITUTIONS. 

u  Where  the  heart  pineth  in  sorrow  and  sadness ; 
Where  the  brain  rioteth  free  in  its  madness; 
Where  Reason's  lamp  burneth,  shrouded,  yet  bright, — 
Oh!  on  such  miseries  'Let  there  be  light!'" 

The  Charitable  Institutions  of  Philadelphia,  proud  mo- 
numents of  benevolence,  rear  their  heads  in  all  parts  of  the  city. 
They  are  not  excelled,  perhaps  not  equalled,  by  those  of  any 
other  city,  of  the  same  extent,  in  the  world.  In  this  particu- 
lar, Philadelphia  has  admirably  illustrated  its  name, — "  Bro- 
therly Love."  First  among  these  praiseworthy  associations 
stands — 

The  Pennsylvania  Hospital. — In  the  year  1751,  a  num- 
ber of  the  benevolent  citizens  of  Philadelphia  were  incorporated 
by  an  Act  of  the  Provincial  Assembly,  as  "  The  Contributors 
to  the  Pennsylvania  Hospital."  The  charter  was  general  in 
its  character,  and  provided  for  "  the  relief  of  the  sick,  and  the 
reception  and  cure  of  lunatics."  From  the  first  opening  of  the 
Institution,  the  Insane  Department  has  always  constituted  a 
prominent  part  of  this  noble  charity,  and  has  claimed  a  large 
share  of  the  attention  of  its  distinguished  medical  officers  and 
managers. 

This  benevolent  enterprise  mainly  relies  for  its  support,  and 
for  the  means  of  extending  its  usefulness,  on  private  contribu- 
tions and  legacies.  From  the  judicious  management  of  these 
resources,  has  arisen  those  substantial  and  convenient  buildings, 
on  Pine  Street,  which  are  now  used  only  for  medical,  surgical, 


250 


PHILADELPHIA     AS     IT     IS. 


THE     PENNSYLVANIA     HOSPITAL. 


and  obstetric  patients,  and  those  more  recently  erected,  two 
miles  from  the  city,  on  the  Haverford  Road,  known  as  the 
Pennsylvania  Hospital  for  the  Insane. 

The  square  on  which  the  first-named  Institution  stands,  is 
bounded  by  Spruce  and  Pine,  and  Eighth  and  Ninth  Streets. 
The  entire  lot  is  enclosed  by  a  brick  wall,  with  the  exception 
of  about  one  hundred  and  fifty  feet  on  Pine  Street,  which  is 
furnished  with  an  iron  railing.  About  seven-eighths  of  the 
square  was  purchased  in  1755,  by  the  managers,  for  £500 ; 
the  remaining  portion  was  presented  to  the  Institution,  by 
Thomas  and  Richard  Penn,  in  1762. 

The  Hospital,  surrounded  on  the  borders  of  the  square  by 
majestic  trees,  exhibits  a  south  front  of  venerable  aspect,  and 
considerable  architectural  beauty,  extending  east  and  west  two 
hundred  and  eighty-one  feet.     It  consists  of  a  centre  building, 


THE    PENNSYLVANIA    HOSPITAL.  251 

united  by  two  long  wards,  three  stories  in  height,  to  two  wings, 
extending  north  and  south.  These  wings  are  surmounted  by 
cupolas,  and  finished  so  as  to  present  fronts  on  Eighth  and 
Ninth  Streets.  The  centre  building  is  sixty-four  feet  front,  by 
sixty-one  in  depth,  and,  to  the  top  of  the  balustrade  surround- 
ing the  cupola,  seventy-two  in  height. 

That  portion  of  the  Hospital  first  erected,  was  the  east 
wing,  the  corner-stone  of  which  was  laid  May  28th,  1755,  by 
John  Key,  the  first  European  born  in  Philadelphia.  It  was 
finished  and  opened  for  the  reception  of  patients,  the  following 
year.  The  west  wing  was  erected  in  1796,  and  the  centre  in 
1805. 

In  addition  to  the  main  edifice,  there  are  various  outhouses, 
together  with  a  building  on  Spruce  Street,  erected  for  the  ex- 
hibition of  West's  celebrated  painting  of  "  Christ  Healing  the 
Sick."  The  net  proceeds  from  the  exhibition  of  this  picture, 
from  1818  until  1848,  when  it  was  removed  to  the  Academy 
of  Fine  Arts,  where  it  still  remains,  was  nearly  824,000. 

A  well-executed  statue  of  William  Penn.  presented  by  his 
grandson,  John  Penn,  Esq.,  stands  in  the  beautiful  lawn 
facing  Pine  Street.     (See  page  252.) 

The  attention  paid  to  neatness  and  ornament  in  the  exterior 
and  grounds  of  this  Institution,  gives  it  an  air  of  elegance 
seldom  equalled  in  establishments  of  the  kind. 

Previous  to  the  year  1841,  a  large  portion  of  the  building 
was  appropriated  to  the  accommodation  of  the  insane ;  but 
since  the  transfer  of  this  class  of  patients  to  the  new  hospital, 
the  building  has  been,  in  a  great  measure,  remodelled,  and  tho- 
roughly repaired;  giving,  in  consequence,  an  enlarged  accom- 
modation for  the  ordinary  medical  and  surgical  patients. 

The  whole  revenue  of  this  noble  charity  is  devoted,  directly 
or  indirectly,  to  the  support  of  the  sick  poor.  All  accidents, 
if  brought  to  the  door  within  twenty-four  hours  after  their  oc-

currence,  are  admitted  without  a  question,  provided  they  have 
not  occurred  out  of  the  State  of  Pennsylvania.  All  cases  of 
chronic  or  acute  disease  are  admitted, — if  it  appears  that  they 
are  at  all  susceptible  of  relief, — as  far  as  the  accommodation 
of  the  house  will  allow.  The  reader  must  remember  that  it  is 
not  an  asylum  for  the  support  of  the  destitute,  but  an  hospital 
for  their  cure  when  sick ;  consequently,  those  beyond  the  reach 
of  treatment  are  not  admitted.  A  limited  number  of  pay  pa- 
tients are  received,  which  is  but  an  extension  of  its  charity ; 
for,  whatever  profits  are  derived  from  this  source,  go  to  in- 
crease the  ability  of  the  Institution  to  relieve  the  poor. 

This  Hospital  has  always  dispensed  its  blessings  with  a  gene- 
rous hand.     At  present,  to  the  one  hundred  and  twenty,  al- 


HOSPITAL    FOR    THE    INSANE.  253 

ready  occupied,  it  has  space  provided  for  one  hundred  and  fifty 
additional  charity  beds. 

Among  the  beneficial  operations  of  this  Institution,  are  the 
medical  lectures  delivered  there,  to  over  three  hundred  medi- 
cal students,  who  annually  attend  upon  the  practice  of  the 
house;  thus  enjoying  opportunities  for  improvement,  the  bene- 
fits of  which,  to  themselves  and  the  communities  among  whom 
they  may  practise,  are  quite  incalculable.  It  is  well  admitted 
that  the  young  practitioner  who  has  sought  instruction  by  the 
bedside,  in  institutions  of  this  kind,  is  far  better  qualified  for 
the  duties  of  his  profession,  than  if  he  enjoyed  no  such  advan- 
tage. For  every  patient  cured  or  well  treated  in  an  hospital, 
hundreds  scattered  through  wide  regions  of  town  and  country 
may  experience  similar  benefits.  In  concluding  our  notice, 
we  will  state,  that  since  1841,  there  have  been  13,829  patients 
received  into  this  establishment,  of  whom  9,800  were  poor. 
The  average  population  of  the  house  at  present,  is  about  one 
hundred  and  fifty-eight, — one  hundred  and  twenty  of  whom 
are  poor. 

Visiters  are  admitted,  from  10  o'clock  to  sunset,  every  day 
except  Sunday ;  and  the  afternoon  of  Saturday,  only  on  special 
business. 

Pennsylvania  Hospital  for  the  Insane. — The  corner- 
stone of  this  building  was  laid  on  the  22d  of  June,  1832; 
it  was  opened  for  the  reception  of  patients  on  the  1st  of 
January,  1841.  It  is  located  on  a  fine  farm,  of  111  acres, 
between  the  Westchester  and  Haverford  Roads,  on  the  latter 
of  which  is  the  gate  of  entrance.  The  principal  building  and 
the  main  wings  present  an  eastern  front  of  four  hundred  and 
thirty-six  feet,  and  consist  of  a  basement  and  two  principal 
stories. 

The  centre  building  is  ninety-six  feet  deep,  sixty-three  feet 
wide,  east  of  its  junctions  with  the  wings,  and  sixty-seven  on 

22 


254  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

its  western  side.  The  former,  which  is  the  principal  front,  is 
built  of  cut  stone,  and  ornamented  with  a  chaste  and  elegant 
Doric  portico ;  the  west  side  has  also  a  portico,  of  smaller  di- 
mensions, and  like  the  rest  of  the  Hospital  is  of  stone,  stuc- 
coed to  resemble  the  principal  front.  The  interior  arrange- 
ments are  unsurpassed  for  convenience  and  perfect  adaptation 
to  the  purpose  designed. 

Running  north  and  south  from  the  centre  buildings,  are  the 
main  wings.  The  north  is  occupied  by  the  male,  and  the 
south  by  the  female  patients ;  they  do  not  differ  materially  in 
their  structure  or  arrangements. 

The  principal  edifice  is  surmounted  by  a  dome,  in  which  are 
placed  iron  tanks,  from  whence  water  is  conveyed  to  every  part 
of  the  building.  The  summit  of  the  dome  is  eighty-five  feet 
above  the  level  of  the  basement,  and  from  it  the  view  is  one 
of  great  beauty,  embracing  a  large  extent  of  country.  In 
the  distance  are  seen  the  Delaware  and  Schuylkill  Rivers, 
the  city  of  Philadelphia,  the  Girard  College,  &amp;c. 

A  short  distance  north  and  south  of  the  main  Hospital,  and 
nearly  on  a  line  with  its  eastern  front,  are  the  "  Lodges," 
one  for  each  sex  :  they  are  also  of  stone,  one  story  high,  and 
built  on  three  sides  of  a  hollow  square,  the  fourth  being 
finished  with  piers  and  an  open  iron  railing,  giving  free  access 
to  the  air,  and  affording  a  handsome  view  of  the  surrounding 
country.  These  Lodges,  are  constructed  especially  for  the 
accommodation  of  noisy  and  violent  patients,  and  have  proved 
an  admirable  part  of  the  Hospital.  Every  year's  experience 
confirms  their  great  value. 

In  each  of  these  buildings,  three  distinct  classes  of  patients 
can  be  accommodated ;  and  from  their  position  and  structure, 
the  noisiest  lunatics  cause  no  annoyance  to  the  inmates  of 
the  main  Hospital,  while  their  accommodations  are  not  less 
comfortable. 


friends'   asylum   for  the   insane.       255 

The  workshop  is  a  handsome  frame  building,  two  stories 
high,  situated  near  the  gateway. 

Of  the  one  hundred  and  eleven  acres  in  the  farm,  about 
forty-one  around  the  Hospital  are  appropriated  as  a  garden  and 
pleasure-ground,  and  enclosed  by  a  substantial  wall.  Immedi- 
ately in  front  of  the  building  is  a  beautiful  lawn,  forming  a 
segment  of  a  circle,  in  which  is  a  circular  railroad,  together 
with  extensive  flower-beds.  The  pleasure-ground  is  beauti- 
fully undulating,  and  interspersed  with  clumps  and  groves  of 
forest  trees;  these  are  fitted  up  with  seats  and  summer-houses, 
and  are  the  favourite  resort  of  the  patients  during  the  summer. 

The  medical  treatment  of  patients  in  this  Institution  is  of 
the  most  judicious  kind.  Here,  reason,  perchance  disturbed 
by  the  cares  of  life,  or  the  hand  of  affliction,  is  not  rudely 
hurled  for  ever  from  its  throne,  by  the  horrors  of  a  madhouse, 
but  is  soothed  and  restored  to  health  by  kindness  and  by  love. 
The  mind  is  not  allowed  to  brood  over  the  past  in  a  gloomy 
cell,  but  is  kept  in  constant  exercise,  by  labour  or  amusement 
in  the  garden,  on  the  farm,  or  in  mechanical  employments  \ — 
riding  in  the  circular  railway,  ten-pins;  carriage  riding,  or  long 
walks ;  the  use  of  musical  instruments ;  attendance  at  parties, 
lectures,  concerts ;  all  the  usual  varieties  of  games,  and  the 
use  of  a  library  and  choice  collection  of  papers  and  periodicals. 
To  this  and  kindred  Institutions, — for  there  are  many  of  them 
now  in  our  land, — we  say  God  speed!  They  are  like  green 
spots  of  verdure  amid  the  desert,  where  the  mind  impaired  in 
its  journey,  can  find  peace  and  repose.  Philadelphians  may 
well  be  proud  of  this  noble  charity. 

Friends'  Asylum  for  the  Insane,  near  Frankford. — 
This  Institution  was  founded  in  the  year  1815,  by  contribu- 
tions from  the  members  of  the  Society  of  Friends,  and  is  now 
supported  by  the  pay  received  from  patients,  donations,  and 
contributions.    The  buildings  are  well  adapted  for  the  purposes 


256  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

designed,  and  the  administration  of  the  Institution  combines 
all  that  humanity  and  prudence  can  produce,  to  cure  or  relieve 
the  unfortunate  objects  of  its  care. 

The  United  States  Naval  Asylum. — This  noble  charity 
was  founded  in  the  year  1835,  as  a  Naval  School  and  an  Hos- 
pital for  Pensioners,  but  is  now  used  for  the  latter  purpose 
only.  It  is  situated  on  the  banks  of  the  River  Schuylkill,  a 
short  distance  below  the  city,  fronting  on  the  Gray's  Ferry 
Road.  The  site  is  one  of  the  most  beautiful  in  the  vicinity 
of  Philadelphia,  being  the  highest  point  of  land  on  the  river 
below  Fairmount. 

The  Asylum  consists  of  three  structures,  separated  from 
each  other,  yet  forming  one  entire  and  beautiful  plan, — the 
main  building,  and  the  residences  of  the  Commodore  and  Sur- 
geon. 

The  main  or  principal  edifice  is  three  stories  in  height,  built 
of  Pennsylvania  marble,  and  presents  a  front  of  380  feet,  in- 
cluding a  centre  building  of  142  feet  by  175  deep  j  it  is  em- 
bellished with  a  beautiful  portico  of  eight  columns  of  the 
Ionic  order.     The  wings  contain  verandas  on  each  story. 

On  the  platform  are  two  field  pieces,  captured  at  the  Battle 
of  Saratoga  -,  and  two  large  marble  balls,  which  were  brought  by 
the  late  Commodore  Elliot  from  the  Hellespont.  The  balls 
are  said  to  have  been  fired  from  the  celebrated  Turkish  mortar, 
the  largest  piece  of  ordnance  in  the  world. 

The  basement,  or  first  story,  of  the  centre  building,  is  divi- 
ded into  a  spacious  dining-room,  the  various  culinary  depart- 
ments, pantry,  and  washing  and  ironing  rooms.  The  wings 
of  this  story  are  divided  into  dormitories,  &amp;c. 

The  second  story  contains  the  Dispensary,  and  the  Officers', 
Surgeon's,  and  Apothecaries'  apartments;  also  a  beautiful 
chapel,  fifty-six  feet  square,  lighted  from  a  dome.  The  wings 
of  this  story  are  fitted  up  into  chambers,  for  the  accommoda- 


UNITED     STATES    NAVAL    ASYLUM.  257 

tion  of  the  Pensioners,  each  being  neatly  furnished  with  a  bed, 
table,  chairs,  &amp;c.  These  rooms  are  well  ventilated  \  they  open 
directly  on  the  verandas,  and  are  kept  remarkably  clean. 
The  third  story  contains  sleeping  apartments,  the  Infirmary, 
baths,  closets,  &amp;c. 

The  whole  building  is  heated  from  furnaces  in  the  basement, 
and  plenteously  supplied  with  water  from  Fairmount. 

The  Asylum  contains  about  140  Pensioners  at  the  present 
time, — among  whom  is  Thomas  Johnson,  the  only  survivor 
of  the  daring  crew  of  the  Bon  Homme  Richard.  He  was  one  of 
the  two  men  who  assisted  Paul  Jones  to  lash  his  vessel  to 
the  British  Frigate  Serapis,  in  that  memorable  engagement  in 
the  British  Channel.*  Each  pensioner  has  an  allowance  of 
thirty-six  dollars  a  year  for  clothing,  and  one  dollar  a  month 
pocket-money,  together  with  one  pound  and  a  half  of  tobacco. 
They  are  not  restricted  in  diet, — each  man  having  as  much  as 
he  requires.  The  bill  of  fare,  as  shown  to  us,  is  equal  to  that 
of  any  hotel  in  the  city. 

The  buildings  are  surrounded  by  a  beautiful  park,  containing 
about  twenty-five  acres,  enclosed  in  front  by  an  elegant  iron 
railing ;  it  is  laid  out  into  walks,  flower-beds,  and  grass-plats, 
and  planted  with  trees,  and  shrubbery.  That  portion  facing 
the  river,  affords  some  fine  views,  embracing  the  Schuylkill 
and  its  shipping,  together  with  the  Almshouse,  Woodland 
Cemetery,  Hamilton  Village,  &amp;c,  on  the  opposite  shore. 

This  Institution  will  compare  favourably  with  any  other  of 
the  kind  in  the  world  :  it  is  worthy  of  the  country.  Long  may 
it  continue  the  happy  home  of  the  brave,  who  have  perilled 
their  lives,  or  impaired  their  health,  in  the  service  of  their 
native  land.

INSTITUTION     FOR     THE     DEAF     AND     DUMB. 


Pennsylvania  Institution  for  the  Education  of  the 
Deaf  and  Dumb. — This  benevolent  Institution  is  situated  at 
the  corner  of  Broad  and  Pine  Streets.  It  was  founded  in  the 
year  1820,  incorporated  in  1821,  and  removed  to  the  present 
building  in  1825 ;  the  original  cost  of  which  was  eighty  thou- 
sand dollars. 

This  charity  is  supported  by  donations  and  the  contributions 
of  annual  subscribers  and  life  members.  By  the  act  of  incor- 
poration, the  State  of  Pennsylvania,  allowed  160  dollars  apiece, 
annually,  for  the  support  of  indigent  pupils  of  this  State,  the 
number  of  whom  was  not  to  exceed  fifty,  and  the  term  of  each 
not  to  extend  over  three  years.  This  number  has  since  been 
increased,  and  the  term  extended,  by  several  enactments. 
The  number  under  the  present  appropriation  is  92,  and  the 
term  allowed  is  six  years. 


INSTITUTION    FOR    THE    BLIND.  259 

The  Institution  at  present  contains  134  pupils,  92  of  whom 
are  supported  by  Pennsylvania,  18  by  Maryland,  13  by  New 
Jersey,  3  by  Delaware,  and  13  by  the  Institution.  The  sys- 
tem of  education  adopted  in  this  establishment  is  that  of  the 
Abbe  de  l'Epee  and  Sicard,  which  has  been  so  successfully 
practised  in  Europe. 

The  edifice  was  erected  from  designs  by  Haviland,  and  is 
constructed  of  granite.  It  is  composed  of  a  centre  building, 
50  feet  front  by  63  in  depth.  The  whole  front,  including  the 
wings,  is  96  feet,  and  it  extends  back  235  feet.  The  facade 
is  ornamented  by  a  chaste  and  beautiful  portico,  in  the  Doric 
style  of  architecture.  There  are  two  spacious  yards,  and  an 
enclosed  plat  laid  out  as  a  flower-garden,  furnishing  ample 
space  for  exercise  for  the  pupils.  The  interior  arrangements 
are  of  the  most  ample  kind,  comprising  eleven  school-rooms,  a 
lecture-room,  cabinet  of  models,  apparatus,  and  specimens, 
airy  sleeping-rooms,  an  infirmary,  workshops,  and  apartments 
for  culinary  purposes,  &amp;c.  To  cultivate  the  understanding,  to 
invigorate  the  constitution,  and  to  train  up  the  child  in  the 
way  he  should  go,  are  the  leading  objects  of  this  Institution, 
and  the  best  efforts  of  the  Officers  and  Directors  have  been 
aimed  to  accomplish  this  great  end.  By  a  rule  of  the  Institu- 
tion, deaf  and  dumb  children  are  not  admitted  under  ten  years 
of  age.  Any  respectable  stranger  is  admitted  to  inspect  the 
building  on  application  to  the  Principal  of  the  Institution,  A.  B. 
Hutton,  A.M. 

Tiie  Pennsylvania  Institution  for  the  Instruction 
of  the  Blind. — This  noble  charity  is  situated  in  Race  Street, 
between  Schuylkill  Second  and  Third  Streets,  and  was  founded 
in  the  year  1833,  through  the  exertions  of  the  benevolent. 

The  buildings  of  this  Asylum  have  been  much  improved 
during  the  last  year,  by  the  erection  of  additional  wings,  an 
extension  of  the  upper  story,  and  a  material  addition  to  the

infirmary  j  this  enlargement  had  become  absolutely  necessary 
in  view  of  the  increased  number  of  applicants. 

The  number  of  pupils  now  receiving  instruction  at  the 
Blind  Asylum  is  93,  of  whom  45  are  supported  by  the  State 
of  Pennsylvania,  6  by  New  Jersey,  5  by  Maryland,  1  by  Dela- 
ware, 15  by  the  Institution,  15  by  their  own  industry,  and  6 
by  their  friends. 

The  amount  of  good  done  by  this  charity  to  a  deeply 
afflicted  class,  and  to  the  community,  by  giving  them  the 
means  of  support,  and  relieving  the  public  from  an  inevitable 
charge,  commends  it  strongly  to  public  favour.  The  organi- 
zation of  such  charities  forms  a  bright  era  in  the  history  of 
our  race  ;  it  is  really  accomplishing  the  words  of  the  Prophet, 
that  "  the  blind  would  see,  the  dumb  speak,  and  the  ears  of 
the  deaf  be  unstopped." 


BLOCKLEY    ALMSHOUSE.  261 

The  Institution  is  open  to  strangers  every  day  except  Sun- 
day, but  to  citizens  it  is  only  open  every  Wednesday  afternoon, 
when  an  opportunity  is  given  to  examine  the  workshops,  &amp;c. 
At  4  o'clock  a  concert  of  vocal  and  instrumental  music  is  given, 
with  an  exhibition  of  the  apparatus  used  in  the  instruction  of 
the  pupils.  Owing  to  the  impossibility  of  accommodating  the 
large  crowds  that  attended  these  exhibitions  when  free,  a 
small  admission  fee  is  now  charged. 

The  Race  Street  line  of  omnibuses  pass  the  premises,  and 
the  Vine  and  Arch  Street  lines  within  a  square  of  the  gate. 

Principal  of  the  Institution,  W.  Chapin. 

Friends'  Almshouse,  located  in  Walnut  below  Fourth 
Street.  This  Institution  is  sustained  by  the  Society  of  Friends, 
by  legacies,  &amp;c.  There  are  few  inmates  at  present.  The 
front  of  the  lot  has  been  improved  by  the  erection  of  several 
elegant  buildings,  occupied  as  offices,  &amp;c.  This  antique  build- 
ing is  worthy  of  a  visit.  It  is  occupied  at  present  by  the 
keeper's  family,  new  buildings  having  been  erected  for  the  ac- 
commodation of  the  inmates. 

Blockley  Almshouse. — The  extensive  range  of  build- 
ings comprising  this  Almshouse,  are  situated  on  the  west  side 
of  the  River  Schuylkill,  opposite  the  city.  They  consist  of 
four  edifices,  each  500  feet  front,  three  stories  high,  including 
the  basement,  of  regular  ashlar  masonry,  so  arranged  as  to 
enclose  a  rectangular  yard.  The  front  facing  the  city  is  orna- 
mented by  an  elegant  portico,  in  the  Tuscan  order  of  architec- 
ture, having  six  columns,  five  feet  in  diameter  at  the  base,  and 
thirty  feet  high,  giving  a  grand  and  imposing  appearance  to 
the  structure.  Looking  at  its  exterior,  it  is  really  a  palace  for 
the  poor. 

The  average  number  of  paupers  maintained  during  the  past 
year,  was  1813,  at  an  expense  of  $97,925  55, — being  at  the 
rate  of  $1  0-4  per  week  each. 


262  PHILADELPHIA     AS     IT    IS. 

The  manufactory  and  house  of  employment,  during  the  same 
period,  yielded  $21,707  21,  and  the  farm  $14,857  05. 

The  Children's  Asylum  attached  to  the  Almshouse,  contains 
at  present  about  362  boys  and  1498  girls,  altogether  1860, 
supported  at  an  expense  of  $69,525. 

The  Insane  department  contains  about  390  of  these  poor 
unfortunates. 

The  Hospital  consists  of  11  wards,  each  47  by  44  feet,  and 
two  attics ;  altogether  containing  432  beds.  There  are  at  pre- 
sent about  349  patients  under  care. 

These  buildings  have  every  necessary  accommodation  that 
can  reasonably  be  expected.     What  city  has  better  ? 

We  may  here  remark,  that  the  cost  of  supporting  the  poor 
at  the  Almshouse  and  in  the  City  and  Districts  was  $228,977  11, 
during  the  year  1851. 

Moyamensing  Almshouse,  situated  on  Irish  Track  Lane, 
below  Fitzwater  Street.  The  principal  building  is  of  brick,  with 
several  out-houses ;  attached  are  a  number  of  acres  of  ground, 
on  which  produce  is  raised  for  the  use  of  the  Institution. 

This  public  charity  is  under  the  control  of  the  District  of 
Moyamensing,  which,  in  consideration  of  taking  care  of  their 
own  poor,  pays  no  tax  into  the  general  city  and  county  fund 
for  that  purpose. 

The  Wills  Hospital,  for  the  Diseases  of  the  Eye  and 
Limbs,  was  founded  by  the  late  James  Wills  of  Philadelphia, 
who  bequeathed  to  the  city  for  that  purpose,  the  sum  of 
$108,396 ;  which  at  the  time  of  the  completion  of  the  build- 
ing, had  accumulated  to  $122,548.  The  expense  of  its  erec- 
tion, including  the  cost  of  the  lot,  was  $57,203,  leaving  a 
balance  of  $65,345  ;  the  interest  of  which  is  available  for  the 
support  of  the  Institution. 

The  corner-stone  was  laid  on  the  2d  of  April,  1832, 
and  on  the  3d  of  March,  1834,  the  Hospital  was  opened  for 
the  reception  of  patients. 


WILLS     HOSPITAL 


263 


WILLS     HOSPITAL. 


It  is  a  neat  stone  structure,  eighty  feet  long  and  fifty  feet 
deep,  with  a  piazza  on  the  south  side  extending  through  its 
entire  length,  and  is  divided  into  two  large  wards,  and  a  number 
of  smaller  and  more  private  rooms,  besides  those  occupied  by 
the  officers  and  others  connected  with  the  establishment. 

The  Hospital  is  beautifully  situated,  being  immediately 
opposite  to  Logan  Square.  The  ample  grounds  appertaining 
to  it,  together  with  the  delightful  promenade  in  front,  secure 
not  only  free  ventilation,  but,  to  a  considerable  extent,  also, 
the  healthful  influences  of  a  rural  location.  In  addition  to  the 
legacy  of  Mr.  Wills,  several  small  bequests  have  been  re- 
ceived from  other  individuals,  among  them  one  by  the  late 
Dr.  Blenon  ;  and  the  Institution  is  moreover  allowed  by  Act 
of  Legislature  the  temporary  use  of  the  unemployed  income 
from  a  fund  left  by  John  Bleakly,  in  1802,  for  the  relief 


264  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

of  the  poor  during  visitations  of  the  yellow  fever ;  the  net 
annual  proceeds  of  which  amount  at  present  to  $554. 

The  greatest  number  of  patients  admitted  hitherto  into  the 
Hospital,  at  any  one  time,  is  about  forty-five ;  but  many  more 
attend  as  "  out-patients,"  for  advice  and  medicine.  Since  its 
foundation,  upwards  of  two  thousand  persons  have  been  cured 
or  relieved,  as  inmates  of  the  Institution,  and  more  than  twice 
that  number  have  received  its  benefits  in  their  own  homes. 
Most  of  these  cases  are  such  as  would  have  proved  incurable 
in  private  practice,  and  in  numerous  instances  the  sufferers 
have  been  restored  to  sight  from  a  state  of  total  blindness. 

Persons  applying  for  gratuitous  admission  are  expected  to 
bring  satisfactory  evidence  of  respectable  character  and  indi- 
gent circumstances;  pay  patients  are  also  admitted,  and  the 
managers  are  thus  enabled  to  diffuse  its  advantages  more 
widely  among  the  poor  than  they  could  otherwise  do.  Pa- 
tients from  distant  parts  of  the  country,  have  sought  relief 
there  in  preference  to  treatment  at  their  own  homes  or  hotels, 
and  will  continue  to  do  so  in  greater  numbers,  as  more  ex- 
tended accommodations  are  provided. 

Such  enlargement  is  very  much  required;  and  it  is  to  be 
regretted  that  means  should  be  wanting  for  so  beneficent  a 
purpose.  Founded  for  the  cure  of  diseases  of  the  Limbs,  as 
well  as  those  of  the  Eye,  to  which  it  is  at  present  restricted, 
it  might,  with  adequate  endowments,  comprehend  ail  recent 
accidents,  as  well  as  chronic  ailments,  affecting  the  extremities. 
It  is  a  stock,  moreover,  upon  which  various  branches  of  healing 
may  be  engrafted,  bearing  severally  such  designation  as  might 
be  given  them  by  their  respective  founders.  Nothing  forbids 
the  association  therewith  of  a  medical  department  also ;  and 
the  city  would  thus  be  furnished  with  another  general  hospital, 
now  greatly  needed,  of  convenient  access,  and  unsurpassed  in 
beauty  and  healthfulness  of  location  by  any  similar  Institution 
in  the  world. 


THE    CITY    HOSPITAL.  265 

For  many  years,  it  has  been  steadily  dispensing  to  the  poor 
the  blessings  it  was  intended  to  impart.  The  good  which  it 
has  done,  and  is  still  doing,  even  in  the  contracted  sphere  of 
its  present  operations,  is  incalculable ;  and  with  the  addition 
of  two  wings,  appropriated  one  to  the  Orthopedic  and  the 
other  to  the  Ophthalmic  department,  it  would  be  an  honour 
to  the  city,  and  take  at  once  high  rank  among  the  charitable 
institutions  of  the  world. 

The  Wills  Hospital  is  governed  by  a  Board  of  eighteen  Di- 
rectors, appointed  by  the  City  Councils,  who  confide  its  profes- 
sional charge  to  the  following  gentlemen,  the  first-named  three 
of  whom  have  been  connected  with  the  Institution  from  its 
commencement,  J.  Hays,  M.D.,  S.  Littell,  M.D.,  J.  Parrish, 
M.D.,  J.  Neill,  M.D. 

The  City  Hospital  at  Bush  Hill,  is  situated  at  the 
southwest  corner  of  Schuylkill  Fourth  and  Coates  Street, 
Spring  Garden.  The  structure  is  of  brick,  and  consists  of  a 
centre  building,  three"  stories  high,  connected  to  two-story 
wings,  running  east  and  west.  A  portico,  enclosed  with  pivot 
blinds,  extends  on  three  sides  of  the  east,  and  the  entire 
length  of  the  west  wing.  In  the  front  on  Coates  Street,  is  an 
ample  space,  enclosed  by  a  wicket  fence,  handsomely  laid  out 
in  walks,  flower-beds,  &amp;c.  On  each  end  is  a  garden,  and  in 
the  rear,  a  yard,  outhouses,  &amp;c. 

The  centre  on  the  floor  and  level  with  the  entrance  is  occu- 
pied by  a  hall,  apartments  for  the  different  officers,  and  a 
spacious  stairway  leading  to  the  upper  stories.  The  second 
story  is  divided  into  four,  and  the  third  into  five  chambers. 
The  attic  also  contains  five  rooms.  The  wings,  one  for  male 
and  the  other  for  female  patients,  are  each  divided  into  seven 
wards  ;  all  well  aired  by  spacious  windows.  There  is  also  a 
room  for  insane  patients. 

The  apartments  and  wards  of  this  Hospital  are  kept  reruark- 

23

ably  clean,  and  its  whole  arrangement  is  under  the  most 
judicious  management.  Thus,  though  seldom  occupied  by 
patients,  it  is  always  in  a  state  of  readiness  for  any  emergency. 
This  Institution  was  established  by  Act  of  Assembly,  January 
7th,  1818,  as  a  Pest  Hospital,  where  all  persons  may  be  sent, 
by  order  of  the  Board  of  Health,  Sanitary  Committee,  or 
other  persons  appointed  by  the  Board  of  Health,  who  are 
afflicted  with  a  pestilential  or  contagious  disease. 

The  Hospital  is  under  the  exclusive  control  of  the  Sanitary 
Committee  of  the  Board,  which  is  composed  at  present  of  the 
following  gentlemen,  viz.,  Dr.  John  A.  Elkinton,  Dr.  Plea- 
sants, William  Goodwin,  Esq.,  Edward  C.  Markley,  Esq., 
Dr.  Gardiner,  and  Thomas  J.  Herring,  Esq.  The  physician 
of  the  Hospital  is  Dr.  John  J.  Bird,  and  the  Matron,  Lydia 
Tomlinson. 

An  hospital  carriage  is  always  in  readiness  to  convey  patients 
to  the  Institution  from  any  part  of  the  city  or  county. 

Christ  Church  Hospital,  Cherry  Street,  between  Third 
and  Fourth  Streets,  founded  by  Dr.  J.  Kearsley,  for  the 
relief  of  indigent  females  of  the  Episcopal  Church. 

The  Saint  Joseph's  Hospital,  Green  Hill.  This  Institu- 
tion is  situated  on  the  Girard  Avenue,  within  a  short  distance 
of  Girard  College,  and  has  the  advantage  of  a  fine  open  lot 
around  it,  which  is  well  ventilated  from  the  absence  of  con- 
tiguous buildings.  It  is  capable  of  accommodating  sixty 
patients,  the  males  and  females  being  in  separate  buildings, 
and  receives  them  at  the  low  price  of  three  dollars  per  week, 
either  for  surgical  or  medical  treatment.  It  is  administered 
in  its  nursing  by  an  experienced  religious  community,  the 
Sisters  of  Saint  Joseph.  Persons  desirous  of  entering  will 
call  upon  one  of  the  Managers  acting  as  an  Hospital  Com- 
mittee, and  furnish  the  requisite  security  for  their  accommoda-

of  a  severe  kind  are  received  at  once  for  a  limited  time.

THE   DISPENSARIES. 

There  are  four  of  these  valuable  institutions  in  Philadelphia, 
to  dispense  medicine,  and  medical  advice,  to  the  poor.  It  has 
been  truly  and  justly  observed,  that  there  are  many  in  every 
community,  whose  situation  prevents  their  entering  an  Hospi- 
tal, while  there  are  many  others  whom  an  honourable  pride 
deters  from  a  public  exhibition  of  their  wants.  To  such,  esta- 
blishments like  those  under  notice,  must  prove  a  real  blessing; 
and  it  cannot  be  doubted,  nay,  we  have  ample  evidence,  that 
many  valuable  lives  are  saved  to  the  community  by  their 
operations. 

The  Philadelphia  Dispensary,  South  Fifth  below  Chest- 
nut Street,  was  the  first  established  in  this  city,  being  founded 
in  1786.  The  Institution  is  under  the  control  of  a  Board  of 
twelve  Managers,  elected  annually,  by  the  contributors.  The 
Managers  elect  six  attending  and  four  consulting  physicians  and 
surgeons,  an  Apothecary,  and  a  Treasurer.  The  physicians  and 
surgeons  attend  in  their  turn  at  the  Dispensary  every  day,  at  3 
o'clock,  p.  M.  The  apothecary  resides  in  the  building.  All 
cases,  whether  acute,  chronic,  surgical,  or  obstetrical,  are 
promptly  attended  to,  when  recommended  by  a  contributor  or 
by  making  proper  application  to  the  Dispensary  j  such  as  are 
not  able  to  come  in  person,  are  attended  at  their  homes  ;  but 


268  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

no  persons  are  deemed  objects  of  this  charity  but  such  as  are 
really  necessitous. 

According  to  the  last  report  of  the  Institution,  there  have 
been  7,362  patients  under  care  of  the  Dispensary  during  the 
year  past,  of  which  number  7,251  recovered,  78  died,  and  33 
remain  under  care. 

The  Obstetric  department,  founded  in  1837,  has  now  become, 
under  its  able  management,  a  perfect  system  of  prompt  and 
active  usefulness. 

The  payment  of  five  dollars  entitles  the  donor  to  the  privi- 
leges of  a  contributor,  and  the  payment  of  fifty  dollars  con- 
stitutes a  life  membership. 

The  Northern  Dispensary  was  established  in  1816.  It 
is  located  at  No.  1  Spring  Garden  Street.  There  is  connected 
with  this  Institution  a  lying-in  department,  where  the  poor 
can  have  the  best  attendance,  with  every  comfort  that  can  rea- 
sonably be  expected  ;  indeed,  we  are  informed  that  few  in  the 
better  ranks  of  society  have  better  attendance  than  those  receive 
who  enjoy  the  blessings  of  this  charity. 

MOYAMENSING    DISPENSARY    AND     HOUSE    OF    INDUSTRY, 

Catharine  Street,  above  Seventh.  This  Institution  went  into 
operation  in  1847,  since  which  time  it  has  done  an  incalculable 
amount  of  good,  in  restoring  the  health  and  saving  the  lives 
of  thousands  of  indigent  sufferers.  In  the  district  of  its  loca- 
tion, a  county  officer  was  known  to  receive,  previous  to  its 
establishment,  over  8600  per  month,  for  burying  the  dead, 
who  were  sent  to  the  grave  for  want  of  timely  medical  assist- 
ance ;  now,  the  same  officer  has  rarely  a  case  during  the  same 
period.  Few  charitable  institutions  have  stronger  claims  upon 
the  benevolent. 

Preston  Retreat,  at  present  used  by  the  Foster  Home 
Association.  This  elegant  building,  designed  as  a  lying-in 
hospital  for  indigent  married  women,  was  founded  by  bequest 
of  Dr.   Jonas  Preston.      The   edifice  is  one  of  the  most

beautiful  in  the  city.  The  lot  upon  which  it  stands  occupies 
an  entire  square,  extending  from  Schuylkill  Second  to  Third 
Street,  and  from  Hamilton  to  Spring  Garden  Street. 

The  funds  left  for  the  support  of  this  Institution  are  ample, 
but  in  consequence  of  their  not  being  available, — being  in- 
vested in  the  Schuylkill  Navigation  Company's  stock, — the 
object  of  the  testator  has  not  been  carried  into  effect.  In  the 
mean  time,  the  managers  have  allowed  the  Foster  Home  Asso- 
ciation to  occupy  the  premises. 

This  Society,  as  its  name  implies,  is  instituted  to  provide  a 
home  for  the  children  of  the  poor,  and  it  now  feeds,  clothes, 
and  instructs  about  74  little  homeless  ones.  In  our  visit  to 
this  Asylum,  we  were  delighted  with  the  order,  remarkable 
cleanliness,  and  decorum,  that  pervaded  the  whole  establish- 
ment ;  and  it  was  pleasing  to  see  the  affection  evinced  by  the

children  toward  their  attendants.  Nowhere  did  we  see  happier 
or  more  cheerful  faces.  We  recommend  the  generous  to  visit 
the  "  Home ;"  we  know  that  their  charity  will  not  be  mis- 
placed. 

House  or  Industry,  Catharine  Street  between  Seventh 
and  Eighth  Streets.  This  charity  was  organized  in  the 
winter  of  1846,  through  the  exertions  of  Mr.  Mullen,  who, 
being  acquainted  with  the  deplorable  condition  of  the  poor  in 
the  District  of  Moy  amen  sing,  felt  prompted  to  relieve  their  most 
pressing  necessities,  as  far  as  his  individual  means  would  per- 
mit. In  this  benevolent  mission  he  soon  found  the  destitute  far 
more  numerous  than  he  anticipated,  and  a  very  large  portion 
sunk  in  the  deepest  and  most  hopeless  poverty ;  consequently, 
he  was  led  to  devise  other  means  for  their  relief.  The  plan 
of  the  Institution  under  notice  was  the  result,  which  from  its 
inception  proved  successful.  Other  kindred  spirits  were  soon 
attracted  to  his  aid,  thus  cheering  on  the  undertaking  and 
enabling  it,  by  enlarged  means,  to  extend  its  blessings.  It 
has  been  ascertained,  that  by  the  system  of  giving  employment 
to  the  poor,  the  association  have  been  able  to  keep  each  indi- 
vidual comfortable,  through  the  most  inclement  season  of  the 
year,  at  the  small  expense  of  about  one  dollar  for  three 
months  over  the  received  value  of  their  labour,  or  an  average 
of  a  little  more  than  four  dollars  per  annum.  But  this  is  not 
the  most  important  view  of  this  subject.  It  has  also  done 
much  towards  the  diminution  of  crime  in  the  District  of  its 
location.  We  find  that  in  January,  1845,  there  were  409  com- 
mitments to  the  County  Prison,  of  which  number  212  were 
from  Moyamensing  alone;  now  the  proportion  from  this 
quarter  is  greatly  diminished.  The  Coroner,  in  1846,  received 
not  less  than  six  hundred  dollars  per  month  for  burying  the 
dead,  over  whom  he  held  inquests,  in  this,   then   called  "  In- 


THE   widows'   asylum.  271 

fected  District ;"  now,  his  receipts  for  this  purpose  are  much 
reduced. 

In  this  benevolent  enterprise  Mr.  Mullen  has  laboured 
without  any  other  remuneration  than  that  which  ought  to 
animate  the  followers  of  Him,  who  came  to  preach  glad 
tidings,  to  bind  up  the  broken  heart,  and  to  raise  the  fallen. 
We  dwell  upon  this  effort,  because  it  shows  what  one  person 
can  accomplish  by  perseverance  and  devotion  to  one  object. 
Happy  is  that  man  who  makes  that  object  the  temporal  and 
eternal  welfare  of  his  fellow-men.  We  commend  the  enter- 
prise to  our  readers  as  a  system  that  might  well  be  adopted 
in  all  large  cities,  not  only  with  benefit  to  the  destitute,  but 
with  an  actual  saving  to  the  public  in  every  point  of  view. 

The  present  buildings  were  erected  in  1848,  the  interior 
arrangements  of  which  are  well  adapted  to  the  benevolent 
object.  The  lower  story  consists  of  a  store,  for  the  sale  of 
provisions,  &amp;c,  to  the  poor,  at  cost  prices,  a  room  fitted  up 
for  the  Moyamensing  Soup  Society,  an  office  for  the  Moya- 
mensing  Dispensary,  a  kitchen,  and  a  free  bathing  and  washing 
establishment.  It  is  a  usual  thing  for  workmen  to  stop  here 
after  their  day's  labour,  and  bathe,  going  home  clean  and  re- 
freshed. In  the  second  story  are  the  work-rooms  of  the  Insti- 
tution. The  third  story  contains  the  much-talked-of  Ragged 
Schools.  Everything  in  this  room  appeared  to  us  in  good 
order.  These  schools  are  under  the  charge  of  some  benevo- 
lent ladies  of  the  Society  of  Friends.  The  fourth  story  is 
divided  into  small  rooms,  for  the  purpose  of  giving  a  night's 
shelter  to  those  without  a  home. 

We  were  much  gratified  with  the  general  appearance  of  the 
entire  establishment.  It  is  a  model  in  point  of  cleanliness, 
order,  judicious  management,  and  practical  benevolence. 

The  Widows'  Asylum,  situated  at  the  northeast  corner  of 
Schuylkill  Fifth  and  Cherry  Streets,  was  instituted  in  the  year 


272  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

1819,  by  contributions,  and  it  still  depends  upon  the  same 
resources  for  support.  It  contains  at  present  about  sixty 
inmates,  the  oldest  of  whom  is  ninety  years  of  age. 

Philadelphia  Lying-in  Asylum,  for  the  Relief  of 
Indigent  Women. — This  is  a  new  and  praiseworthy  Institu- 
tion, located  at  No.  229  Arch  Street.  It  was  organized  on  the 
10th  of  October,  1850. 

St.  Ann's  Widows'  Asylum,  Moyamensing  Road  below 
Christian  Street,  is  under  the  charge  of  the  Sisters  of  St.  Joseph. 

Roman  Catholic  Benevolent  Society  of  Philadelphia, 
an  association  of  ladies,  who  visit  the  sick  and  distressed 
poor,  affording  them  such  aid  as  their  means  will  allow  in 
clothing,  provisions,  money,  &amp;c. 

The  Orphans'  Society  of  Philadelphia,  Race  Street 
and  Schuylkill  Fifth,  was  formed  on  the  20th  of  March,  1814, 
by  a  number  of  ladies,  who  convened  for  that  purpose  in  the 
schoolroom  of  the  Second  Presbyterian  Church,  and  was  incor- 
porated on  the  29th  of  January,  1816. 

The  object  of  this  benevolent  association,  is  "to  rescue  from 
ignorance,  idleness,  and  vice,  destitute,  unprotected,  and  help- 
less children,  by  providing  for  them  that  support  and  instruc- 
tion which  will  eventually  enable  them  to  become  useful 
members  of  society."  The  first  orphan  was  admitted  on  the 
3d  of  March,  1815.  The  family  at  present  consists  of  eighty- 
four  children, — forty-eight  boys  and  thirty-six  girls. 

According  to  the  by-laws,  no  boy  shall  be  bound  out  as  a 
house  servant,  or  to  a  tavern-keeper,  nor  until  he  has  received 
a  suitable  education,  and  no  girl  can  be  bound  to  a  tavern  or 
boarding-house  keeper.  It  is  the  duty  of  the  managers — an 
onerous  one  too,  self-imposed  though  it  be — to  keep  a  mater- 
nal eye  over  these  children,  after  they  leave  the  Institution,  by 
visiting  them  occasionally,  and  inquiring  into  their  conduct 
and  treatment. 


THE   orphans'    society.  273 

In  the  year  1816,  the  Society  received  a  donation  of  a  large 
lot  of  ground,  that  on  which  the  present  building  stands,  from 
four  gentlemen,  viz.,  Messrs.  J.  Cook,  Jacob  Justice,  James 
Wilnier,  and  Jonah  Thompson.  The  foundation  of  the  first  Asy- 
lum was  laid  the  same  year,  and  the  building  completed,  and 
occupied  by  the  children,  in  April,  1818.  This  first  Orphans' 
Home  was  a  substantial  structure,  fifty  by  fifty-three  feet, 
three  stories  high,  exclusive  of  a  basement  and  attic,  and  was 
erected  at  a  cost  of  $26,675.  This  building  was  entirely  de- 
stroyed by  fire,  on  the  morning  of  the  24th  of  January,  1822, 
when,  melancholy  to  relate,  twenty-three  of  its  little  inmates 
perished  in  the  conflagration.  At  that  time,  there  were  ninety 
orphans  in  the  family.  Such  was  the  rapidity  of  the  flames, 
that  of  those  who  escaped,  few  saved  more  than  their  night- 
clothes.  The  fire  having  commenced  in  the  kitchen,  soon 
extended  to  the  stairway,  and  from  thence  it  enveloped  the 
entire  building.  Repeated  noble  attempts  were  made  to 
rescue  the  little  sufferers,  but  the  efforts  were  rendered  of  no 
avail  for  want  of  ladders. 

The  sympathy  of  our  citizens  was  awakened  by  this  cala- 
mity, and  the  sum  of  827,978  was  speedily  obtained,  which, 
with  a  grant  of  $5,000  from  the  State,  enabled  the  managers 
to  rebuild  the  Asylum  the  following  year.  The  present  edifice 
is  from  a  design  by  William  Strickland,  and  presents  an 
excellent  plan,  embracing  every  requisite  accommodation  for 
the  inmates  at  that  date ;  we  think,  however,  that  at  present 
many  improvements  and  additions  might  advantageously  be 
made. 

The  structure  is  of  brick,  one  hundred  and  ten  feet  by  fifty- 
three,  and  consists  of  a  basement,  a  principal,  and  an  attic  story. 
The  materials  are  of  the  best  kind,  and  the  workmanship 
executed  in  the  most  substantial  manner.  The  basement  is 
arched,  and  the  stairways  are  of  stone ;  indeed,  the  building, 


274  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

we  may  say,  is  entirely  fire-proof.  A  large  area  is  attached 
to  the  Asylum,  used  as  a  play-ground,  which,  considering  its 
immediate  vicinity  to  one  of  our  noble  squares,  gives  it  the  ad- 
vantage of  a  rural  location. 

The  benevolence  of  the  Christian  appears  truly  in  a  work 
like  this.  What  friend  of  his  country,  of  humanity,  does  not 
wish  well  to  such  a  noble  institution  ! 

Saint  John's  Orphan  Asylum. — This  new  and  elegant 
building  is  located  on  the  west  side  of  the  Schuylkill  River, 
about  two  and  a  half  miles  from  Market  Street  Bridge.  It  is 
built  on  a  lot  of  thirteen  acres,  adjoining  the  Cathedral  Ceme- 
tery. The  structure  is  of  brown  stone,  in  the  Tudor  style  of 
Gothic  architecture, — a  style  peculiarly  suited  for  such  insti- 
tutions. It  consists  of  a  main  edifice,  sixty  feet  long  by  fifty 
deep,  and  four  stories  high,  connected  to  wings  of  three  stories 
the  extremes  finishing  with  pointed  gables  j  the  whole  length 
is  two  hundred  and  twenty  feet.  Over  the  main  building  is  a 
turret,  surmounted  by  a  cross.  The  height  from  the  ground 
to  the  top  of  the  cross  is  ninety-six  feet.  The  interior,  in 
accordance  with  the  exterior  appearance  of  the  building,  is 
finished  in  a  plain,  substantial  manner.  The  basement  of  the 
centre  block,  contains  the  various  culinary  departments,  wash 
and  bath  rooms,  together  with  the  refectory  and  a  play-room 
for  the  children,  when  the  weather  is  such  as  to  prevent  their 
enjoying  out-door  amusements.  The  upper  portion  is  appro- 
priated to  the  use  of  the  "  Sisters,"  or  religious  order 
having  charge  of  the  Institution.  The  north  wing  contains 
the  chapel,  schoolrooms,  and  dormitories ;  and  the  south  wing 
is  devoted  entirely  to  dormitories.  There  are  three  staircases, 
all  of  easy  access,  from  any  part  of  the  building  by  the  cor- 
ridors. Particular  care  has  been  taken  in  the  construction  of 
these  stairways,  to  make  them  commodious  and  strong.  The 
building  is  designed  to  accommodate  a  family  of  about  two

hundred    and   fifty    orphans,    and    their    attendants.      J.    T. 
Mahony,  Esq.,  was  the  architect  of  this  beautiful  edifice. 

Saint  John's  Female  Orphan  Asylum. — This  Institu- 
tion, under  charge  of  the  religious  order  of  the  Sisters  of 
Charity,  is  situated  on  the  southwest  corner  of  Spruce  and 
Seventh  Streets.  The  average  number  of  orphans  is  one 
hundred. 

MAGDALEN   ASYLUMS. 

There  are  three  of  these  praiseworthy  institutions  in  Phila- 
delphia. The  Magdalen  Asylum,  Schuylkill  Second  above 
Race  Street,  The  House  of  the  Good  Shepherd,  Schuylkill 
Front  and  George  Street,  and  the  Rosine  Asylum,  Eighth 
above  Wood  Street. 

The  first  of  these  Institutions  was  organized  in  the  year 
1800.  The  number  of  Magdalens  who  have  obtained  shelter 
of  its  charity  since  then,  has  been  about  one  thousand,  of 
whom  upwards  of  five  hundred  have  been  reclaimed,  and 
restored  to  respectable  society,  or  have  died  under  its  care, 
manifesting  satisfactory  evidence  of  true  repentance.  The 
Asylum  is  a  plain  brick  edifice,  erected  by  voluntary  contri- 
butions. 

The  House  of  the  Good  Shepherd,  is  under  charge  of 
the  Sisters  of  the  Good  Shepherd,  a  religious  order,  attached 
to  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  It  has  been  the  means  of  re- 
claiming many  from  the  paths  of  vice. 

The  Rosine  Asylum  is  a  new  institution,  under  the  judi- 
cious management  of  some  of  our  most  benevolent  ladies ; 
since  its  organization  it  has  been  eminently  successful.  It  is 
pleasing  to  know,  that  some  of  our  citizens  sympathize  with 
the  fallen.  A  moment's  reflection  will  convince  the  inquirer 
of  the  absolute  necessity  of  such  institutions  as  those  before 


276  PHILADELPHIA    AS     IT    IS. 

us,  if  we  ever  hope  to  reclaim  the  wanderers  from  the  paths  of 
virtue.  It  has  been  truly  said,  that  the  unhappy  girl  who  has 
been  the  sufferer  from  misplaced  confidence — and  are  there  not 
too  many  such,  who  are  more  sinned  against  than  sinning  ? — 
has  no  hope  of  escape  from  total  ruin,  unless  sheltered  by  such 
asylums.  If  not  here,  where  can  she  go  ?  Her  friends,  and 
too  often  her  parents,  fear  to  take  her  back  to  the  domestic 
hearth,  apprehending  moral  contamination  to  the  other  mem- 
bers of  the  household.  Alas !  cast  out  from  all  that  is  dear 
and  hallowed  in  life,  humbled  in  her  own  estimation,  she  be- 
comes reckless,  and  soon,  very  soon,  seeks  to  drown  her  woes 
in  the  intoxicating  bowl.  That  any  in  such  a  situation,  sur- 
rounded by  such  unfavourable  circumstances,  should  have  the 
resolution  to  stop  and  seek  to  regain  a  virtuous  course  of  life, 
while  the  world,  notwithstanding  their  penitence  and  tears, 
treats  them  with  coldness,  enough  to  deter  many  from  less 
noble  resolutions,  is  truly  a  matter  of  wonder.  We  hope  that 
the  importance  of  these  institutions  will  be  regarded  in  their 
proper  light,  by  the  citizens  of  Philadelphia,  a  city  whose 
boast  is  her  benevolence.     None  have  stronger  claims. 

Coloured  Orphans'  Asylum,  Thirteenth  above  Callowhill 
Street.  This  is  a  large  and  commodious  building  for  the 
maintenance  and  education  of  coloured  orphans,  and  is  one  of 
the  many  monuments  of  the  benevolence  of  our  citizens.  It 
contains  at  present  about  sixty-seven  children.  This  Institu- 
tion has  rescued  many  little  ones  from  the  abodes  of  wretched- 
ness and  vice,  which  abound  in  some  neighbourhoods  of  the 
southern  portion  of  our  city.  It  is  a  cheering  thought  that 
they  may  in  a  future  day,  become  useful  members  of  society, 
instead  of  a  prey  to  the  miseries  of  crime,  to  which  they  were 
exposed.  Many  poor  but  worthy  coloured  people,  also,  have 
had  their  dying  moments  soothed,  by  the  knowledge  that  there 
was  a  comfortable  home  provided  for  their  bereaved  little 
ones. 


BENEVOLENT     SOCIETIES,     ETC.  277 

Donations  are  gratefully  received  at  the  Asylum. 

To  the  above  we  may  add,  the  Provident  Society,  The 
Union  Benevolent  Society,  The  Northern  Association 
for  the  Relief  and  Employment  of  Poor  Women,  and 
The  Temporary  Home  Asylum.  These  associations  and  a 
multitude  of  others,  are  organized  to  assist  the  poor,  by  pro- 
viding employment  and  relieving  their  immediate  wants.  The 
remark  is  often  made,  that  these  societies,  "  do  too  much  for 
the  poor,"  and  that  they  encourage  idleness.  This  is  not  so ; 
for,  from  examination  and  inquiry,  we  do  not  hesitate  to  say, 
that  in  very  few  cases  has  their  benevolence  been  imposed  upon. 
Let  the  caviller  accompany  the  visiters  of  any  one  of  them, 
and  he  will  for  ever  after  hold  his  peace,  if  not  assist  in  the 
good  work. 

We  might  add  to  this  extensive  list,  the  various  Soup  So- 
cieties and  City  Trusts,  for  the  distribution  of  bread,  wood, 
and  coal,  to  the  poor;  the  various  Beneficial  Associations, 
organized  for  mutual  support  in  time  of  sickness, — a  guide  to 
which  would  form  a  book  itself, — The  Humane  Society  for 
the  Recovery  of  Drowned  Persons,  The  Society  for 
Alleviating  the  Miseries  of  Prisons,  The  Colonization 
Society,  the  various  Abolition  Societies,  The  Foreign 
Benevolent  Societies  of  St.  George,  St.  Andrew,  St. 
Patrick,  St.  David,  &amp;c,  until  we  exceeded  the  limits  of  the 
present  work.

PENN'S    TREATY    WITH    THE    INDIANS.  279 


CHAPTER  VIII. 

CHURCHES  AND   RELIGIOUS   INSTITUTIONS. 

Religious  societies  of  all  denominations  are  exceedingly 
numerous  in  Philadelphia.  This  is  creditable  to  the  memory 
of  its  founder,  whose  wish  was,  that  every  one  might  worship 
God  according  to  the  dictates  of  his  own  conscience. 

Penn,  himself  a  distinguished  leader  in  the  Society  of 
Friends,  solemnly  declares,  that  he  came  into  the  charge  of 
founding  the  Province  of  Pennsylvania  for  "the  Lord's  sake." 
He  desired  to  establish  a  people  who  should  be  a  praise  in  the 
earth,  for  conduct,  as  well  as  for  civil  and  religious  liberty. 

Few  of  the  old  churches  in  Philadelphia  are  distinguished 
for  architectural  beauty;  but  many,  erected  within  the  last  few 
years,  are  remarkable  for  elegance  and  comfort.  Being  de- 
signed to  suit  the  wants  and  the  characters  of  a  republican 
people,  they  excel  in  beauty  of  design,  elegance  of  execution, 
and  chasteness  of  decoration,  rather  than  ornate  display. 

The  first  of  these  societies  which  claims  our  attention,  is 
The  Friends,  or  Quakers.  Meetings  of  this  Society  were 
held,  previous  to  the  settlement  of  Philadelphia,  at  the  house 
of  Thomas  Fairman,  at  Shackamaxon, — the  present  Kensing- 
ton. 

This  house,  Watson  says  in  his  "  Annals,"  was  near  "  the 
Elm  Tree,"  that  subsequently  obtained  such  renown  as  being 
the  scene  of  Penn's  Treaty  of  Friendship  with  the  Indians. 
It  was  at  this  Treaty  (of  which  our  engraving  is  a  beautiful 
view)  that  Penn  addressed  them  in  these  memorable  words  : 
"  We  meet  on  the  broad  pathway  of  good  faith  and  good  will. 


280  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

No  advantage  shall  be  taken  on  either  side,  but  all  shall  be 
openness  and  love.  I  will  not  call  you  children,  for  parents 
sometimes  chide  their  children  too  severely ;  nor  brothers  only, 
for  brothers  differ ; — the  friendship  between  thee  and  me  I  will 
not  compare  to  a  chain,  for  that  the  rains  may  rust,  or  the 
falling  tree  may  break  :  we  are  the  same  as  if  one  man's 
body  were  to  be  divided  into  two  parts ;  we  are  all  one  flesh 
and  blood."  The  impression  made  upon  the  minds  of  the 
Indians  by  Penn,  at  this  and  subsequent  interviews,  was  such 
that  they  ever  after  retained  the  highest  esteem  for  his  me- 
mory, and  good  will  towards  Friends.  Years  after,  when  cruel- 
minded  men  made  the  waters  of  the  placid  Conestoga  red  with 
the  blood  of  the  Christian  Indians,  many  of  them  fled,  outcasts 
from  their  homes,  to  the  city  of  Brotherly  Love,  to  seek  and 
find  protection  among  the  followers  of  "  Maquon,"  as  they 
termed  Penn.  On  one  occasion  a  chieftain,  in  a  reply  to  a  com- 
missioner said,  "  that  they  should  never  forget  the  counsel 
William  Penn  gave  them  '  as  long  as  the  sun  gives  light.' " 

In  1685,  a  meeting-house  was  erected  at  the  southwest 
corner  of  Centre  Square.  This  building  was  designed  as  a 
state-house,  market-house,  as  well  as  the  chief  meeting-house. 
Another  meeting-house  was  erected,  in  1685,  in  Front  above 
Arch  Street.  This  was  intended  to  serve  for  "  evening  meet- 
ings/' and  the  Centre  Square  one  for  the  "day  meetings." 
In  after  years,  when  the  house  in  Pine  Street  (this  old  build- 
ing still  remains)  was  erected,  they  called  the  Front  Street 
building  the  "  North  Meeting."  In  1789,  this  structure  was 
removed,  and  a  meeting-house  erected  in  Key's  Alley.  In  the 
year  1695,  the  fourth  meeting-house  of  this  Society  was 
built,  at  the  southwest  corner  of  Second  and  Market  Streets. 
This  was  styled,  by  those  unfavourable  to  Friends'  principles, 
the  "Quaker  Cathedral;"  "but,"  says  Watson,  "great  as 
were  the  ideas  of  the  primitive  population,  it  was  removed,  in 


friends'    meeting-houses.  281 

1755,  to  build  still  greater.  The  meetings,  in  time,"  lie  con- 
tinues, "  were  so  disturbed  by  the  noise  and  turmoil  of  the 
increased  population,  that  it  was  deemed  expedient  to  sell  the 
property  •"  which  was  done  in  1808,  when  the  present  large 
meeting-house,  on  Arch  near  Fourth  Street,  was  erected. 

The  Friends'  meeting-houses  are  all  remarkable  for  their 
plain  and  substantial  appearance.  The  following  will  be  found 
to  embrace  all  those  in  the  city,  at  present. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Fourth  and  Arch  Streets.  The 
burial-ground  attached  to  this  building  is  the  oldest  in  Phila- 
delphia, with  the  exception  of  that  belonging  to  the  Swedes' 
Church,  Southwark.  "William  Penn  spoke  over  the  grave  of 
the  first  person  interred  in  it. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Ninth  and  Spruce  Streets. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Twelfth  between  Chestnut  and 
Market  Streets. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Green  near  Fourth  Street. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Sixth  and  Noble  Streets. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Washington  Street,  opposite 
Washington  Square. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Pine  below  Second  Street. 

Friends'  or  Free  Quakers'  Meeting-House,  Race  below 
Fifth. 

Friends'  or  Free  Quakers'  Meeting-House,  Arch  and 
Fifth  Streets. 

Friends'  BIeeting-House,  West  Philadelphia,  near  the 
forks  of  Westchester  and  Darby  turnpike  roads. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  Main  Street,  Germantown. 

Friends'  Meeting-House,  School  Street,  Germantown. 

In  addition  to  these,  they  have  one  in  Byberry  and  two  in 
Frankford.

EPISCOPAL   CHURCHES. 

The  first  church  edifice  of  this  denomination  to  which  we 
call  the  attention  of  the  reader,  is  that  of  the  Gloria  Dei,  or 
Swedes'  Church,  situated  in  Swanson  below  Christian  Street, 
near  the  Navy  Yard.  It  is  the  oldest  church  in  Philadelphia, 
having  been  erected  in  1700.  Its  predecessor  occupied  the 
same  site,  and  was  erected  in  1677,  four  years  before  the  ar- 
rival of  Penn's  colony,  in  1681.  It  was  a  log  building,  con- 
structed to  serve  both  as  a  place  of  worship,  and  a  block-house 
against  the  Indians.  The  burial-ground  attached  to  the  Gloria 
Dei,  presents  a  striking  contrast  to  the  more  modern  cemeteries, 
in  the  rude,  antique  lettering  of  its  grave-stones. 

While  viewing  this  ancient  edifice,  the  history  of  the  past 
is  powerfully  recalled.  The  graves,  scattered  around,  con- 
jure up  many  a  scene  of  trial,  encountered  by  those  early 
pioneers.  Here  lie  the  remains  of  Alexander  Wilson, 
the  ornithologist :  he  desired  to  be  buried  in  this  churchyard, 
on  account  of  its  beautiful  location  and  retirement ! 

The  next  in  point  of  antiquity  and  historical  interest  is, 

Christ  Church,  in  Second  above  Market  Street.  This 
church  was  organized  under  the  auspices  of  the  Rev.  Mr. 
Clayton,  in  1695.  Its  first  place  of  worship  was  also  a  log 
building,  which  was  subsequently  enlarged  and  improved. 
This  primitive  structure  gave  place  to  the  present  stately  edi- 
fice, which  was  commenced  in  1727,  and  completed  in  1753. 
The  steeple  is  a  graceful  piece  of  architecture.  It  contains  a 
chime  of  eight  bells,  purchased  in  England.  They  were  brought 
to  Philadelphia  freight  free,  in  the  ship  Matilda,  Captain 
Budden,  and  in  compliment  to  his  generosity,  as  often  as  he 
arrived,  in  subsequent  years,  they  rang  forth  a  merry  peal  of 
welcome.      The    communion    service    of  this    church   is   very

interesting,  part  of  it  having  been  presented  by  Queen  Anne, 
in  1708. 

St.  Peter's  Church,  stands  on  the  southwest  corner  of 
Third  and  Pine  Streets.  It  was  founded  in  the  year  1758  as 
a  "  chapel  of  ease"  to  Christ  Church.  It  has  a  venerable  and 
imposing  appearance.     The  spire  is  of  modern  construction, 


Vg4  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

and  contains  a  chime  of  bells,  presented  by  the  late  Mr.  Wil- 
cox, for  many  years  an  extensive  trader  to  China. 

St.  James'  Church,  Seventh  above  Market  Street,  erected 
in  1809,  is  a  plain  brick  structure,  extending  east  and  west 
ninety  feet,  and  is  sixty  feet  wide.  The  foundation  of  a 
spire  has  been  laid,  but  it  is  doubtful  whether  it  will  ever  be 
erected. 

St.  Paul's  Church,  Third  below  Walnut  Street.  This 
edifice  was  built  in  the  year  1762,  by  a  few  particular  friends 
of  the  Rev.  Dr.  M'Clenaghan,  as  an  Independent  Episcopal 
Church. 

Church  of  the  Epiphany,  Schuylkill  Eighth  and  Chestnut 
Streets,  is  a  rich  and  imposing  edifice,  with  a  portico  in  the 
Doric  order. 

Church  of  the  Atonement,  Summer  and  Schuylkill 
Sixth  Streets.  This  is  a  new  building,  in  the  early  English 
style. 

Grace  Church,  Twelfth  and  Cherry  Streets. 

St.  Luke's  Church,  Thirteenth  near  Pine  Street.  This 
is  one  of  the  most  beautiful  and  commodious  church  edifices 
in  Philadelphia.  The  portico  is  a  fine  example  of  the  Corin- 
thian order. 

Church  of  the  Ascension,  Lombard  above  Eleventh 
Street. 

Church  of  the  Mediator,  Schuylkill  Fourth  and  Lom- 
bard Streets. 

St.  Philip's  Church,  Vine  Street,  near  Franklin  Square. 

St.  Andrew's  Church,  Eighth  near  Spruce  Street.  The 
facade  of  this  building  is  one  of  the  most  perfect  specimens  of 
the  Grecian  Ionic  order  in  this  city.  It  is  copied  from  the 
celebrated  Temple  of  Bacchus  at  Teos.  It  consists  of  a  portico 
of  six  fluted  columns  in  enstyle,  with  a  strictly  copied  entabla- 
ture, embracing  all  the  enrichments  and    members  of  the  ori- 


EPISCOPAL    CHURCHES.  285 

ginal.  The  portico  is  approached  by  a  flight  of  six  marble  steps, 
extending  the  whole  width  of  the  front.  The  main  entrance 
is  fourteen  feet  by  twenty-five ;  subdivided  into  seven  horizontal 
compartments  of  four  panels  each.  The  fascios  of  the  panels 
are  bold,  and  enriched  with  the  egg  moulding,  the  stiles  and 
rails  are  studded  with  rivets,  giving  the  whole  the  character 
of  strength.  The  nave  is  planned  with  middle  and  side  aisles, 
the  seats  being  disposed  in  simple  parallelograms,  running  east 
and  west ;  their  general  appearance  is  that  of  a  Grecian  lounge. 
The  front  of  the  gallery  is  divided,  on  each  side,  into  five  equal 
divisions,  forming  an  elongated  panel,  each  enriched  with 
carved  mouldings.  The  columns  supporting  the  gallery  are 
composed  of  a  cluster  of  palm  leaves,  turning  over  at  the  top, 
thus  forming  the  capital;  over  each  is  introduced  a  wreath, 
the  whole  supporting  a  light  and  graceful  entablature.  In  the 
west  end  of  the  church,  facing  the  entrance,  are  placed  the 
pulpit  and  chancel.  The  whole  of  the  interior  entrance  is  17 
by  25  feet.  The  principal  feature  in  this  design  is  two  large 
columns,  with  their  pilasters  and  entablatures,  copied  from 
the  Temple  of  Minerva  Polius  at  Athens,  and  executed  with 
all  the  enrichments,  without  the  slightest  deviation  from  the 
proportions  given  in  "  Stewart's  Athens.'"  The  pulpit,  read- 
ing-desk, and  communion  table,  are  elegantly  executed.  The 
organ  loft  occupies  the  east  end  of  the  building,  over  the  ves- 
tibule. The  front  of  the  organ  represents  a  Grecian  lyre, 
standing  on  a  pedestal,  between  a  cluster  of  pipes,  forming 
themselves  into  a  tower,  surmounted  by  leaves,  with  a  vase  at 
each  wing.  This  design  is  highly  and  richly  finished,  and 
forms  one  of  the  chief  ornaments  of  the  church. 

In  the  rear  of  the  main  edifice  is  an  additional  building, 
erected  within  the  last  few  years.  It  affords  a  commodious 
vestry-room,  school-room,  &amp;c.     The  lot  on  which  the  church 


286  PHILADELPHIA    AS     IT    IS. 

stands,  is  enclosed  in  front  by  a  neat  iron  railing,  and  on  each 
side  of  the  church  it  is  laid  out  in  burial  lots. 

Mr.  Haviland  was  the  architect  of  St.  Andrew's,  and  it  cer- 
tainly reflects  credit  on  his  taste  and  skill. 

St.  Stephen's  Church,  Tenth  below  Market  Street.  This 
imposing  and  beautiful  Gothic  structure  was  erected  and  con- 
secrated in  the  year  1823.  The  front  on  Tenth  Street  consists 
of  two  octangular  towers,  eighty-six  feet  in  height,  comprising 
five  stories,  with  windows  and  offsets,  terminating  in  an  em- 
battled parapet.  The  towers  are  connected  by  a  screen  wall, 
thirty  feet  wide,  by  sixty  high.  There  are  three  doors  of 
entrance,  over  which  there  are  three  large  windows,  formed 
with  a  recessed  arch,  twenty-four  feet  wide,  by  thirty-six  in 
height.  On  each  flank  are  the  windows  of  the  north  and 
south  aisles,  separated  by  mullions  into  four  compartments, 
and  decorated  with  panelled  tracery.  A  vestibule  communi- 
cates with  a  stairway  in  each  tower,  leading  to  the  gallery  and 
organ  loft.  From  the  vestibule  there  are  three  screen  doors, 
which  open  into  the  body  of  the  church.  The  interior  is 
highly  finished.  On  entering,  the  contrast  between  the  open 
sky,  and  the  pervading  shade,  is  so  striking  as  to  immediately 
arrest  the  attention.  This  light  has  a  pleasing  effect,  from  its 
perfect  harmony  with  the  peculiarities  of  the  architecture. 
Here  it  is  poured  in  a  golden  flood  through  the  deeply-stained 
and  richly-coloured  glass  of  the  windows ) — it  darts  through 
the  arches,  streams  across  the  aisles,  illuminating  the  minutest 
ornaments  of  the  lofty  roof :  everything  is  gilded  with  lustre. 

The  chancel  and  pulpit  form  the  principal  decorations  of  the 
eastern  end,  being  richly  finished  with  reversed  screen  panels 
and  clustered  columns,  supporting  four  canopies.  The  large 
window  behind  the  pulpit  is  filled  with  beautifully-stained 
glass.  This  window  is  flanked  by  recessed  panels,  containing 
marble  tablets,  upon  which  the  Lord's  Prayer,  and  the  Creed, 


EPISCOPAL    CHURCHES.  287 

are  engraved.  The  gallery  screen  is  parallel  with  the  sides  of 
the  church,  connected  in  a  semicircular  form  on  the  west  end. 
It  is  enriched  with  perforated  tracery  and  panel-work,  and  is 
supported  by  clustered  columns,  the  front  reed  of  each  column 
rising  above  the  capital,  and  terminating  in  a  canopy,  on  a 
level  with  the  top  rail  of  the  screen.  From  the  upper  part  of 
the  windows,  on  the  flanks,  spring  the  massy  ribs  which  sus- 
tain the  roof;  each  rib  is  supported  by  brackets,  and  termi- 
nates in  a  pendant,  the  spandrels  being  pierced  with  panels. 
These  ribs,  brackets,  and  pendants,  being  regularly  disposed 
along  the  ceiling,  dividing  it  into  so  many  compartments,  pro- 
duce a  rich  and  beautiful  effect.  The  organ  loft  is  on  the  west 
end,  over  the  vestibule.  It  is  capable  of  containing  eighty 
choristers,  and  is  amply  lighted  by  the  three  front  windows. 

St.  John's  Church,  St.  John's  and  Brown  Street,  is  a 
neat  and  substantial  edifice,  decorated  with  a  portico  of  two 
columns  in  front. 

Church  of  the  Advent,  Old  York  Road  above  Tam- 
many Street. 

St.  Mark's  Church,  Locust  near  Schuylkill  Seventh 
Street.  This  beautiful  Gothic  structure  was  erected  in  1849, 
and  consecrated  to  its  high  and  holy  use,  as  a  house  of  prayer, 
May  21st,  1850;  on  which  occasion  there  were  sixty-one  cler- 
gymen present — twenty-seven  of  them,  in  surplices,  filling  the 
noble  chancel,  and  adding  much  to  the  solemnity  of  the  scene. 
The  building  is  of  that  order  of  Gothic  architecture  known  as 
the  "  decorative,"  which  prevailed  at  a  period  when  it  may  be 
said  that  this  order  attained  its  highest  point  of  graceful  pro- 
portion and  luxuriant  beauty.  The  churches  of  that  age  were 
distinguished  for  their  fine  proportions  and  beauty  of  interior 
effect :  the  style  is  therefore  valued  by  the  artist  for  its  fine 
forms  of  adaptation  to  sacred  edifices  of  every  size  and  cost, 
from  the  parish  church  to  the  gorgeous  cathedral.

ST.     MARKS     CHURCH. 


St.  Mark's  is  situated  on  the  north  side  of  Locust  Street, 
on  a  lot  of  ample  size,  which  is  enclosed  from  the  street  by  an 
ornamental  iron  railing.  The  building  extends  east  and  west 
150  feet;  and  its  breadth,  including  the  tower,  is  91  feet.  It 
is  constructed  entirely  of  freestone,  neither  paint  nor  plaster 
having  been  used  internally  or  externally, — the  inside  walls 


EPISCOPAL    CHURCHES.  289 

being  lined  with  dressed  stone,  and  the  woodwork  of  solid  oak. 
The  tower  is  in  the  position  of  a  south  porch ;  and  through  it 
is  the  principal  entrance,  by  a  richly  moulded  doorway,  orna- 
mented with  foliated  shafts  in  the  jambs.  The  windows  of 
the  aisles  and  clerestory  on  the  flank  are  of  two  lights,  divided 
by  mullions  of  stone,  which  are  foliated  in  the  arch,  showing  a 
variety  of  elegant  patterns.  They  have  also  moulded  stone 
jambs. 

The  church  has  a  most  imposing  appearance,  as  viewed  from 
the  southeast :  its  lofty  tower  and  tapering  spire  are  thence 
seen  in  all  their  beauty.  Upon  the  elegance  of  these  peculiar 
features  of  Gothic  architecture  it  is  needless  to  dwell.  The 
page  of  romance  is  filled  with  descriptions  of  the  "  heaven- 
directed  spire ;" — the  artist  cannot  draw  a  landscape,  the  poet 
an  Arcadian  region,  nor  the  novelist  a  fairy-land,  in  which  the 
spire  is  not  introduced.  Of  the  beauty  of  St.  Mark's  tower 
and  spire,  all  are  competent  judges.  From  the  plain  and  solid 
buttress,  as  it  rises  from  the  ground,  to  the  beautifully-exe- 
cuted tracery  adorning  the  top  of  the  tower,  from  whence  the 
spire  ascends,  the  eye  knows  not  where  to  stop.  It  wanders 
in  delight  from  the  distant  vane  to  the  massive  base,  and  ob- 
serves every  part,  melting  into,  as  it  were,  and  harmonizing 
with  the  other.  It  meets  with  nothing  to  offend,  nothing  to 
disturb  it.  Here  are  no  occult  angles,  to  attract  and  disturb 
the  attention ;  no  awkward  attempts  at  grandeur,  to  provoke  a 
smile.  This  tower  and  spire,  in  connexion  with  the  edifice, 
we  consider  among  the  happiest  efforts  of  its  accomplished 
architect,  John  Notman,  Esq.  The  whole  is  beautifully  and 
justly  proportioned. 

The  interior  is  remarkable  for  its  chaste  simplicity  and  ele- 
gance. It  is  divided  into  a  chancel,  nave,  and  aisle.  The 
chancel  is  furnished  with  stalls  for  twenty-four  seats ;  there  is 
also  an  arcade  of  three  niches,  forming  the  ancient  sedilia,  and 

25

a  recess,  to  be  used  as  a  credence  table.  The  altar  is  of  stone, 
covered  with  a  rich  velvet  cloth,  exquisitely  wrought  in  gold. 
Above  the  altar  is  the  great  east  window,  of  five  lights,  with 
mullions  and  foliated  tracery  in  stone ;  this  is  filled  with  ex- 
ceedingly rich  stained  glass,  of  the  most  magnificent  colours; 
it  contains  the  figures  of  our  Saviour  and  the  Apostles  Peter, 
Paul,  and  John,  together  with  that  of  St.  John  the  Bap- 
tist. The  brilliancy  of  the  drapery  in  these  portraits  is  re- 
markable, although  we  think  the  shading  too  heavy ;  for  we 
must  remember  that  a  stained-glass  window  is  not  a  mere  pic- 
ture, but  a  means  of  admitting  light  j  modified  and  tempered, 
it  is  true,  but  still  light,  for  the  building  to  which  it  apper- 
tains. The  nave  is  twenty-eight  feet  wide,  and  one  hundred 
feet  long.  The  north  and  south  aisles  are  each  fourteen  feet 
wide  by  one  hundred  long.  The  divisions  are  in  seven  bays 
on  each  side ;  the  piers  and  arches  are  of  cut  stone,  supporting 
the  clerestory,  with  bracket-shafts  for  the  roof-timbers.  The 
roof  is  open-timbered,  with  moulded  hammer  and  collar-beams. 
The  north  aisle  connects  with  the  organ  aisle  by  a  fine  stone 
arch,  which  is  also  open  to  the  chancel.  The  seats  are  of  oak; 
plain,  but  of  suitable  design.  The  windows  are  all  glazed  in 
lead,  having  borders  and  tracery  in  coloured  glass,  exhibiting 
a  great  variety  of  beautiful  patterns.  The  great  west  window 
is  of  four  lights.  It  contains  the  figures  of  the  four  Evange- 
lists. The  tracery  is  also  filled  with  fine  glass.  The  drawing 
and  pictorial  effects  of  these  figures  are  exquisite  specimens  of 
the  art.  The  whole  of  this  noble  window  is  rich  in  harmony 
and  effect,  and  gives  an  admirable  finish  to  the  entire  structure. 
The  prayer-desk  is  of  an  elegant  design,  corresponding  to  the 
pulpit,  both  of  which  are  of  carved  oak,  and  of  octagonal  form. 
The  pulpit  is  raised  on  a  stone  base,  on  the  north  side  of  the 
chancel  arch.  A  movable  lantern  stands  between  the  two, 
from  which  the  lessons  are  read.     The  whole  floor  is  laid  in 


EPISCOPAL    CHURCHES.  291 

tile,  of  a  great  variety  of  colours  and  patterns.  These  tiles 
were  imported  by  Mr.  S.  A.  Harrison,  No.  146  Walnut  Street. 
We  hope  to  see  them  generally  introduced  into  our  public 
buildings,  since  they  are  admirably  adapted  to  the  climate,  and 
can  be  obtained  at  about  one-half  the  cost  of  marble,  while 
they  have  a  more  beautiful  effect. 

The  cost  of  this  building,  not  including  the  tower  and  spire, 
was  $30,000.  It  is  the  private  enterprise  of  five  individuals, 
members  of  the  congregation. 

St.  Jude's  Church,  in  Franklin  above  Brown  Street,  be- 
tween Seventh  and  Eighth  Streets,  is  built  in  the  early  English 
Gothic  style,  with  the  high,  pointed  roof.  Its  form  is  that  of 
a  Latin  cross,  forty-two  feet  front  on  Franklin  Street,  ex- 
tending that  width  to  the  transepts,  which  are  forty  feet  deep, 
where  it  widens  to  eighty  feet.  The  head  of  the  cross  beyond 
the  chancel  will  form  a  Sunday-school  building  when  it  is 
completed  :  the  whole  length  of  the  structure  then  will  be  one 
hundred  and  twelve  feet,  from  east  to  west.  The  entrances 
are  through  the  tower  (which  it  is  intended  to  surmount  with 
a  spire),  and  through  the  corresponding  porch  on  the  north 
side.  The  church  is  slightly  elevated  from  the  street,  and  is 
without  basement.     The  roof  inside  is  open-timbered. 

Church  of  the  Nativity,  Eleventh  and  Washington 
Streets.  This  is  another  beautiful  Gothic  structure,  highly 
creditable  to  its  architect,  N.  Le  Brun,  Esq.,  under  whose 
superintendence  it  was  erected. 

Church  of  the  Redemption,  northwest  corner  of  Callow- 
hill  and  Schuylkill  Front  Streets,  is  another  specimen  of  the 
early  English  style.  The  building,  however,  is  small,  and  one 
of  the  least  expensive  kind. 

Church  of  the  Messiah,  Port  Richmond,  is  also  a  Gothic 
building,  every  way  worthy  of  the  flourishing  district  of  its 
location.

Church  of  the  Crucifixion,  Seventh  near  Bedford  Street. 
This  is  a  Free  Mission  Church,  for  the  coloured  population  of

originally  amongst  the  most  destitute  and  depraved  of  the 
coloured  race.  It  has,  however,  gradually  extended  its  influ- 
ence, and  now  comprises  a  respectable  congregation,  and  a 
flourishing  Sabbath  school.  The  present  edifice  is  of  modern 
construction.  It  is  a  plain  but  substantial  building,  capable 
of  seating  about  five  hundred  persons.

PRESBYTERIAN    CHURCHES. 

This  Church  was  established  in  the  city  of  Philadelphia  as 
early  as  the  year  1695.  The  first  congregation  was  organized, 
and  held  their  primary  meetings,  in  a  small  frame  building,  one 


PRESBYTERIAN    CHURCHES.  293 

story  high,  which  for  many  years  stood  on  the  northwest  corner 
of  Chestnut  and  Second  Streets.  Mr.  Jedediah  Andrews  was 
their  first  regular  pastor.  This  congregation  having  increased 
in  number,  erected,  in  the  year  1704,  the  building  which  for- 
merly stood  in  Market  Street,  between  Second  and  Third 
Streets.  This  was  a  spacious  edifice,  built  in  the  Grecian 
style.  During  the  religious  excitement  occasioned  by  the 
preaching  of  the  Rev.  Gr.  Whitfield,  there  was  a  division  in 
this  society,  and  a  part  withdrew,  under  the  name  of  the  "  New 
School,"  to  Mr.  Whitfield's  meeting-house.  This  building  was 
known  in  after  years,  as  "the  Old  Academy/'  in  Fourth  below 
Arch  Street. 

In  1750,  the  New  School,  then  under  the  pastoral  care  of 
the  Rev.  Gr.  Tennent,  erected  the  church  that  lately  stood 
on  the  northwest  corner  of  Third  and  Arch  Streets.  This  edi- 
fice was  long  known  as  the  "new  meeting-house."  Subse- 
quently this  congregation  became  reconciled  to  the  parent 
stock,  to  which  they  were  reunited,  under  the  name  of  the 
Second  Presbyterian  Church.  The  Third  Church,  situated 
in  Pine  Street,  between  Fourth  and  Fifth  Streets,  was  esta- 
blished by  the  Market  Street  congregation,  to  accommodate 
that  portion  of  their  members  "  living  on  the  hill." 

The  Presbyterian  Church,  since  its  establishment  in  this 
city,  has  been  eminently  prosperous,  no  sect  having  exercised 
a  more  salutary  influence  in  the  cause  of  humanity  and  reli- 
gion. 

The  First  Presbyterian  Church  is  beautifully  situated 
in  Locust  Street,  opposite  Washington  Square.  It  is  a  brick 
building,  roughcast  to  imitate  marble.  The  front  elevation  is 
said  to  be  a  copy  of  the  celebrated  Ionic  temple  on  the  river 
Illyssus,  at  Athens.  The  structure  is  eighty-eight  feet  in 
length,  by  seventy-one  in  width ;  the  vestibule  and  principal 
entrance,  thirty-seven  by  thirty-two.     The  pulpit  is  placed  at 

25* 


294  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

the  south  end  and  is  constructed  in  a  segment  of  a  circle. 
This  building  is  one  of  the  most  commodious  in  the  city. 

The  Second  Presbyterian  Church,  in  Seventh  below 
Arch  Street,  we  have  no  hesitation  in  pronouncing  one  of  the 
most  elegant  places  of  worship  in  Philadelphia,  remarkable 
alike  for  chaste  simplicity  and  beautiful  proportions. 

The  Third  Church  is  located  in  Pine  near  Fourth  Street. 

The  Fourth  Church  is  a  plain  brick  building  in  Lombard 
near  Thirteenth  Street. 

The  Fifth  Church,  Arch  above  Tenth  Street.  This  im- 
posing building  was  erected  in  the  year  1823.  It  is  beauti- 
fully situated  on  one  of  the  most  elevated  parts  of  the  city,  to 
which  its  steeple  is  highly  ornamental,  exhibiting  in  one  view 
in  their  proper  grades,  from  the  base  to  the  summit,  the 
Doric,  the  Ionic,  the  Corinthian,  and  the  Composite  orders  of 
architecture.  The  height  of  the  tower  and  spire  is  165  feet. 
The  building  extends  ninety-one  feet  north  and  south,  by 
sixty-five  in  width.  Its  design  comprises  simplicity  and  ele- 
gance, in  a  degree  and  manner  well  suited  to  the  sacred  uses 
for  which  it  was  erected. 

A  large  and  important  addition  has  been  made  to  this 
church  during  the  past  year,  by  the  erection  of  a  building,  to 
accommodate  the  Sunday  Schools,  on  the  rear  of  the  lot. 

The  Sixth  Church  is  in  Spruce  near  Sixth  Street. 

The  Seventh,  or  Penn  Square  Presbyterian  Church, 
is  situated  on  the  corner  of  Broad  and  Olive  Streets.  The 
style  of  architecture,  fine  proportions,  and  chaste  appearance 
which  characterize  this  edifice,  attract  the  notice  and  elicit  the 
admiration  of  our  citizens.  It  is  justly  esteemed  among  the 
ornaments  of  Philadelphia.  The  principal  front,  on  Broad 
Street,  consists  of  a  Corinthian  portico  of  eight  columns,  so 
disposed  as  to  have  a  return  column  at  each  angle  and  to  partly 
surround  the  massive  foundation  of  a  steeple,  which  it  is  in- 
tended to  erect  in  a  short  time.     The  approach  to  this  portico

is  by  a  flight  of  thirteen  steps.  The  walls  and  flanks  are 
embellished  with  pilasters,  the  whole  supporting  an  entablature 
enriched  with  ornaments  peculiar  to  classic  architecture.  In 
the  basement  are  ample  and  convenient  rooms  for  the  Sabbath 
School,  and  lecture-rooms.  The  principal  story  is  finished  in 
an  elegant  and  chaste  style,  being  in  conformity  with  the  ex- 
terior. The  pulpit  rests  upon  a  basement,  four  feet  in  height, 
supporting  a  screen  of  four  Corinthian  pillars,  whose  rich  enta- 
blature extends  to  the  ceiling,  which  is  panelled  in  the  most 
beautiful  manner,  the  whole  presenting  an  imposing  appearance, 
heightened  by  the  exquisite  proportions  and  harmony  of  colour 
which  reign  throughout. 

The  steeple  intended  to  surmount  the  structure  will  rise  to 
the  altitude  of  215  feet;  it  will  be  octagonal  throughout  in 
its  plan,  viz., — a  panelled  pedestal  base,  supporting  a  story 
consisting  of  a  monopteral  portico  of  eight  columns,  above  the 
screen  wall  and  entablature  of  which,  the  spire  will  be  built. 
This  beautiful  edifice  was  designed  by  and  erected  under  the 
superintendence  of  N.  Le  Brun,  Esq.,  architect,  and  is  one  of 
the  first  of  his  construction  in  this  city. 

The  Eighth,  or  Scots'  Presbyterian  Church,  in  Spruce 
above  Third  Street,  was  erected  before  the  War  of  Indepen- 
dence. During  the  occupancy  of  this  city  by  the  British,  it 
was  fitted  up  as  an  army  hospital.  In  the  year  1843  it  was 
considerably  enlarged  and  embellished,  according  to  designs 
furnished  by  N.  Le  Brun,  Esq.  The  building  presents  a 
front  elevation  consisting  of  a  recessed  portico,  in  the  Compo- 
site order,  surmounted  by  a  pediment,  and  flanked  by  panelled 
wings.  From  the  portico,  access  is  obtained  to  the  audience- 
chamber  through  the  vestibule,  on  each  end  of  which  are 
stairs  leading  to  the  galleries.  The  interior  of  the  church  is 
finished  in  a  simple  yet  chaste  manner.  The  pulpit  is  embel- 
lished with  a  screen  of  Ionic  columns.

This  Building  contains  the  offices  of  the  Board  of  Publica- 
tion, the  Board  of  Education,  and  the  Board  of  Domestic 
Missions;  the  fourth  Board,  that  of  Foreign  Missions,  being 
located  at  23  Centre  Street,  New  York. 

Pause  upon  the  massive  pavement,  before  we  enter;  for 
beneath  us,  in  fire-proof  safes,  are  deposited  the  immortal 
works  of  Calvin,  Owen,  Flavel,  Baxter,  Bunyan,  and  others 
famed  in  Church  History. 

The  store  is  large  and  conveniently  fitted  up.  Here,  if  you 
have  any  taste  for  good  reading,  you  will  find  many  valuable 
works.  Proceeding  onward,  we  come  to  the  office  of  the  periodi- 
cals of  the  Church,  viz.,  the  Home  and  Foreign  Record,  and 
Presbyterian  Sabbath  School  Visitor ;  still  farther  back  is  the 
private  room  of  the  Publishing  Agent.  This  effort  of  the 
Church  to  supply  a  healthy  religious  literature  for  the  people, 
is  worthy  of  the  noblest  support. 

In  the  second  story  are  the  offices  of  the  Corresponding  Sec- 
retary, and  General  Agent,  together  with  the  Library,  consisting 
of  a  valuable  collection  of  standard  books  in  Divinity.  History, 
and  Natural  Sciences. 

The  third  story  contains  the  apartments  occupied  by  the 
Board  of  Education,  the  object  of  which  is  to  supply  the 
Church  with  an  educated  Ministry  :  for  that  end  it  assists 
young  men  of  approved  character  and  talents,  through  the 
whole  of  their  education.  It  has  at  present  under  its  care 
about  388  persons. 

In  this  story,  the  offices  of  the  Secretaries  and  Treasurer  of 
the  Board  of  Domestic  Missions  is  also  located.      This  is  one 


ROMAN    CATHOLIC    CHURCHES.  301 

of  the  most  important  Boards  of  this  Church,  as  upon  its 
efforts  their  prosperity  mainly  depends.  During  the  year 
1850  it  has  supported  591  missionaries  in  their  labours,  sup- 
plied 1113  churches,  49  of  which  were  constituted  within  that 
year,  and  within  the  past  twenty-one  years,  it  has  been  instrumen- 
tal in  the  organization  of  943  churches,  aiding  in  the  erection  of 
1484  houses  of  worship,  into  which  upwards  of  40,P00  persons 
have  been  received  on  confession  of  their  faith. 

"We  have  previously  noticed  the  establishment  of  the  first 
Presbyterian  church  in  this  city  in  the  year  1695  :  there  are 
now  in  connexion  with  it,  in  Pennsylvania,  2675  churches, 
2027  ministers,  and  210,306  communicants,  reported  to  the 
General  Assembly. 

Other  parts  of  the  building  are  occupied  by  the  Board  of 
Publication,  for  store-rooms,  workshops,  &amp;c.

The  diocese  of  this  communion  embraces  the  eastern  dis- 
trict of  Pennsylvania,  West  New  Jersey,  and  the  State  of 
Delaware. 

Cathedral  Church  of  St.  Peter  and  St.  Paul,  Schuyl- 
kill Fifth  Street,  between  Race  and  Summer  Streets.  This  vast 
edifice,  now  in  progress  of  construction,  was  commenced  in 
September,  1846 ;  and  although  each  year,  since  that  date, 
considerable  progress  has  been  made  in  the  work,  it  is  at 
present  not  more  than  one-third  advanced  towards  completion. 
It  was  designed  by  N.  Le  Brun,  Esq.,  and  the  whole  interior 
of  the  building,  which  when  finished  will  be  in  the  highest 
degree  grand  and  magnificent,  is  progressing  according  to  the 
original  design. 

The  plan  of  the  edifice  is  that  of  the  modern  Boinan  cruci- 
form churches,  having  in  the  centre  a  great  nave.  The  vault 
over  the  nave  and  transepts  will  be  about  seventy-eight  feet

high,  cylindrical  and  panelled.  Over  the  intersection  of  the 
cross  vaults,  there  is  to  be  a  pendentive  dome,  one  hundred 
and  twenty-five  feet  high.     The  side  aisles  and  transepts  are 


ROMAN    CATHOLIC    CHURCHES.  303 

divided  from  the  nave  by  massive  piers.  The  piers  support 
the  arches  on  which  the  clerestory  is  built ;  these  piers  are  to 
be  richly  ornamented  with  foliated  moulding,  &amp;c. ;  they  will 
be  further  relieved  by  fluted  pilasters,  of  the  Corinthian  order, 
with  enriched  bases  and  capitals.  These  pilasters  will  sup- 
port an  entablature,  including  the  architrave,  frieze,  cornice, 
and  blocking-course ;  over  which  will  spring  the  vaulted  semi- 
circular ceiling. 

The  sanctuary  at  the  east  end  will  be  fifty  feet  square,  and 
the  high  altar,  which  will  be  exceedingly  magnificent,  is  to  be 
within  it.  The  light  thoughout  the  building  is  mainly  to  be 
introduced  through  the  lanterns  of  the  great  dome,  the  small 
pendentive  domes  over  the  aisles,  and  large  semicircular  win- 
dows at  the  west  end.  The  richest  style  of  the  Roman  Corin- 
thian order  will  prevail  throughout  the  building.  The  front, 
on  Schuylkill  Fifth  Street,  is  a  beautiful  design,  by  John  Not- 
man,  Esq.,  of  a  highly  decorative  character,  very  creditable  to 
that  gentleman's  taste  and  skill.  The  plan  consists  of  a  por- 
tico of  four  gigantic  columns,  sixty  feet  high,  and  six  feet  in 
diameter,  finished  with  richly-sculptured  bases  and  capitals ; 
over  these  will  be  an  entablature  and  pediment,  in  corresponding 
architectural  taste.  On  the  frieze  will  be  engraved  the  words 
Ad  Majorem  Dei  Gloriam.  The  apex  of  the  pediment  will  be 
surmounted  by  a  colossal  figure  of  the  Saviour,  and  on  the 
opposite  angles  will  be  the  statues  of  two  angels,  in  a  kneeling 
position.  The  main  entrance  will  be  approached  by  a  flight 
of  nine  steps,  forty-eight  feet  long.  Over  the  central  doorway 
will  be  the  large  west  window,  and  over  the  side  doors  will  be 
niches  to  receive  the  figures  of  the  patron  saints  of  the  church, 
St.  Peter  and  St.  Paul.  These  niches,  together  with  the  door- 
ways and  the  large  window,  will  be  relieved  with  a  bold  and 
richly-executed  architrave.  The  wings,  which  will  be  lower 
than  the  central  facade,  are  also  to  be  decorated  with  columns, 


304  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

pilasters,  and  entablatures,  and  surmounted  by  towers ;  these 
towers  will  rise  to  the  altitude  of  one  hundred  and  ten  feet. 
In  front  of  these  wings,  are  also  floriated  niches,  to  contain 
statues  of  the  "  great  fathers  of  the  Church/'  The  principal 
dome  will  form  an  imposing  feature  in  the  exterior  view.  It 
will  rise  to  the  height  of  two  hundred  and  ten  feet ;  and  will 
be  surrounded  by  a  row  of  columns,  thirty  feet  high,  support- 
ing an  enriched  entablature.  Between  these  columns  will  be 
the  windows  to  light  the  centre  of  the  building.  This  immense 
dome  is  to  be  highly  ornamented,  both  internally  and  exter- 
nally. Its  effect  will  impart  a  grandeur  of  appearance  un- 
equalled by  any  other  building  in  the  country. 

Church  of  St.  John  the  Evangelist,  Thirteenth,  above 
Chestnut  Street,  is  a  large  and  imposing  edifice,  built  in  the 
Gothic  style,  stuccoed  in  imitation  of  marble. 

St.  Augustine's  Church,  Fourth  Street,  between  Race  and 
Vine  Streets,  is  constructed  of  brick,  with  a  tower  in  the 
centre  of  the  front,  which  it  is  intended  to  surmount  with  a 
very  handsome  steeple.  The  whole  of  the  exterior  is  very 
chaste  and  simple.  The  interior  is  arranged  in  the  usual 
manner  of  modern  churches ;  the  sanctuary,  however,  is  novel 
in  design  and  arrangement.  It  is  much  admired.  The  co- 
lumns supporting  the  dome  over  it,  are  of  Scagliola  marble, 
the  capitals  of  which,  together  with  the  entablature  over  them, 
are  richly  carved  and  gilded.  The  design  of  this  beautiful 
feature  of  this  church,  is  copied  from  the  much-admired 
remains  of  the  Temple  of  Jupiter  Olympus  at  Home.  The 
whole  of  the  interior  is  painted  in  distemper,  presenting  an 
exceedingly  rich  and  ornamental  appearance.  The  former 
church  occupying  this  site  was  destroyed  by  fire  in  1844. 
The  present  building  was  erected  from  designs  by  N.  Le  Brun, 
Esq.,  in  1848. 

The  Chapel  of  Our  Lady  of  Consolation,  is  a  neat

is  used  for  the  Sunday  schools  and  confraternities  of  the  con- 
gregation of  that  church.

Trinity  Church,  Sixth  and  Spruce  Streets,  is  an  antique- 
looking  building.  The  remains  of  the  late  Stephen  Girard 
were  interred  in  the  burial-ground  attached  to  this  church, 
from  whence  they  were  removed,  in  1851,  to  the  College 
founded  by  his  beneficence.

St.  Paul's  Church,  Christian  below  Tenth  Street.  This 
is  a  new  and  ornamental  building,  constructed  of  brick,  in  the 
Gothic  style. 

St.  Peter's  Church  (German). — This  building,  situated 
at  the  corner  of  Franklin  Avenue  and  Fifth  Street,  was  com- 
menced in  the  year  1843,  and  the  interior  completed  in  1847. 
The  length  of  the  church  is  one  hundred  and  seventy  feet,  the 
width  of  the  nave  sixty-eight  feet,  and  of  the  front  seventy- 
eight  feet.  The  style  of  architecture  adopted  in  the  interior 
is  that  known  as  the  "  classic  Roman,"  though  the  exterior 
possesses  a  Byzantine  character  in  its  appearance.  The  roofs 
of  several  portions  of  the  building,  such  as  the  vestibules, 
nave,  sanctuaries,  &amp;c,  being  of  different  levels,  impart  a  pic- 
turesque appearance  to  the  whole  structure.  There  is  a  large 
and  massive  tower  in  the  centre  of  the  front,  which  is  at 
present  one  hundred  and  twenty-five  feet  high;   but,  when

finished  according  to  the  design  of  the  architect,  it  will  reach 
the  height  of  two  hundred  and  twenty  feet.  In  the  basement 
story  is  a  chapel,  capable  of  accommodating  four  hundred  per- 
sons, and  two  apartments  appropriated  to  the  use  of  the  Sunday 
schools.  The  main  story  is  very  rich  and  grand  in  appearance. 
The  height  of  the  interior  is  forty-four  feet,  the  entablature 
and  the  panelled  and  coved  ceiling  being  supported  by  a  multi- 
tude of  fluted  Composite  pilasters,  three  feet  wide,  which  are 
raised  upon  panelled  pedestals,  nine  feet  high.  The  sanctuary 
in  the  east  end  is  thirty -five  feet  deep,  within  the  ceiling,  and 
is  ornamented  with  windows  filled  with  beautifully-stained 
glass.  There  are  three  altars.  The  high  altar  is  of  Italian 
marble,  the  table  of  which  is  supported  upon  eight  Doric 
columns.  The  tabernacle  represents  a  cyclostyle  Corinthian 
temple.  Under  the  table  of  the  altar,  and  between  the 
columns,  is  a  marble  sarcophagus.  This  church  could  accom- 
modate two  thousand  persons  \  but  from  the  ample  dimensions 
of  the  pews  and  aisles,  the  number  of  seats  is  considerably 
limited.  The  whole  of  the  superstructure  was  designed  and 
erected  by  N.  Le  Brun,  Esq.  In  the  architectural  portion  of 
the  building,  the  proportions  and  arrangements  are  exact  and 
skilful,  whilst  the  decorative  part  is  equally  to  be  admired. 

Attached  to  this  church  are  several  buildings  for  the  accom- 
modation of  the  religious  order  of  the  Redemptionists,  who  have 
the  church  under  charge.  One  of  these  buildings — that  on 
the  south  side — is  designed  and  built,  although  on  a  limited 
scale,  according  to  the  rules  required  for  monastic  establish- 
ments. 

Church  of  the  Assumption,  Spring  Garden  above  Eleventh 
Street,  is  a  new  building,  much  noted  for  its  rich  and  imposing 
appearance.  It  is  constructed  of  brown  stone,  in  the  decorated 
Gothic  style  of  architecture.

BAPTIST   CHURCHES. 

The  first  settlers  of  this  respectable  denomination  who  arrived 
in  Philadelphia,  came  from  Radnorshire,  in  England,  and 
Killarney,  in  Ireland,  in  the  year  1686.  This  infant  colony 
settled  on  the  banks  of  the  Pennypack  Creek. 

In  1698,  nine  persons  assembled  in  Philadelphia,  and  formed 
themselves  into  a  church,  under  the  pastoral  charge  of  Dr. 
John  Watts.  Their  early  meetings  were  held  in  the  "Old 
Barbadoes  lot  store,"  on  the  corner  of  Second  and  Chestnut 
Streets.  They  subsequently  united  their  interest  with  the 
Presbyterians,  so  as  to  meet  in  the  same  building  for  worship, 
as  often  as  either  could  procure  a  preacher.  This  partnership 
continued  for  about  three  years,  when  the  society  under  notice 
removed  to  "Anthony  Morris's  brewhouse,"  which  was  occu- 
pied occasionally  as  a  mariner's  chapel.  This  building  stood 
on  the  east  side  of  Water  Street,  near  Dock  Creek.  In  this 
humble  location  they  continued  their  labours  until  the  year 
1707,  when,  by  invitation  of  the  followers  of  George  Keith, 
they  united  in  erecting  a  more  commodious  place  of  meeting, 
on  the  site  of  the  present  First  Baptist  Church,  in  Lagrange 
Place,  Second  below  Arch  Street.  Here  they  continued  to 
worship,  the  Keithians  uniting  with  them,  until  the  year  1731, 


308  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

when,  the  building  being  too  small,  it  was  removed,  and  a 
much  larger  one  erected.  This  edifice  has  subsequently  been 
enlarged. 

The  Baptists,  in  olden  times,  performed  the  solemn  rite  of 
immersion  in  the  River  Schuylkill,  at  the  foot  of  Spruce  Street. 
The  place  was  long  celebrated  for  rural  beauty.  It  is  described 
by  a  gentleman,  in  1770,  as  being  "a  spot  where  immense 
trees,  principally  oaks,  afford  a  fine  shade,  while  all  around  is 
variegated  with  shrubs  and  wild  flowers.  Near  the  water  is  a 
large  stone,  elevated  about  three  feet,  made  level  on  the  top 
by  art,  with  steps  hewn  out  at  one  side  to  ascend."  Around 
this  druidical  pulpit  the  people  assembled  to  pray,  and  upon  it 
the  preacher  stood  to  address  them.  This  was  not  only  a  con- 
venient place  for  the  purpose  of  baptism,  but  was  also  a  de- 
lightful resort  in  summer.  The  British  army,  in  1777, 
destroyed  the  grove  for  fuel,  and  the  place  is  now  occupied  by 
coal  wharves,  in  one  of  which  "the  stone  of  witness"  is  buried 
for  ever. 

The  following  comprises  the  churches  of  this  communion  in 
Philadelphia  at  present : 

The  First  Baptist  Church,  Lagrange  Place,  Second 
below  Arch  Street. 

Second  Baptist  Church,  Fifth  below  Carpenter  Street, 
Southwark. 

Sansom  Street  Baptist  Church,  Sansom  above  Eighth 
Street,  from  the  originality  of  its  design,  deserves  particular 
notice.  The  building  is  a  rotunda,  surmounted  by  a  dome, 
crowned  with  a  neat  and  ornamental  cupola.  The  walls  are 
of  brick,  and  the  dome  is  constructed  upon  the  principle 
adopted  in  that  of  the  famous  Halle  de  Ble,  at  Paris.  Above 
the  walls,  which  are  fifty  feet  high,  three  risers  encircle  the 
edifice,  before  the  swell  of  the  dome  appears.  In  front  and 
rear  of  the  rotunda,  square  projections  come  forward, — that  in 


BAPTIST    CHURCHES.  309 

front  to  afford  a  vestibule  and  passage-way  for  the  stairs 
leading  to  the  galleries,  and  that  in  the  rear  to  provide  space 
for  the  vestry-rooms,  &amp;c. 

The  front  consists  of  a  recessed  portico,  flanked  by  wings, 
which  are  surmounted  by  cupolas.  The  principal  entrance  is 
by  a  flight  of  marble  steps,  into  the  portico, — which  is  of  the 
Ionic  order.  On  the  east  and  west  ends  of  this  portico,  are 
the  stairs,  leading  to  the  upper  part  of  the  building.  In  front 
is  the  large  door,  leading  to  the  baptistery  and  pulpit ;  east 
and  west  aisles  run  parallel  with  this.  The  baptistery  is  in 
the  centre  of  the  circle,  surrounded  by  an  open  balustrade. 
The  pulpit,  at  the  south  end,  is  supported  by  a  screen  of 
columns.  The  galleries  encircle  the  nave  of  the  church, 
except  that  section  occupied  by  the  pulpit.  The  pews  in  the 
body  of  the  building,  are  so  disposed  as  to  run  parallel  with 
its  transverse  diameter.  The  number  of  these  pews,  together 
with  those  in  the  galleries,  is  three  hundred  and  twenty, 
which,  with  the  free  sittings,  will  contain  with  comfort,  up- 
wards of  two  thousand,  five  hundred  persons.  The  structure 
is  amply  lighted  by  large  square  windows  below,  and  an  arcad  e 
of  semicircular  windows  above  the  galleries.  The  lintels  of 
the  dome  light  the  centre,  and  ventilate  the  whole  church . 
The  base  of  the  dome  is  encompassed  by  a  broad  dental  band , 
mouldings,  &amp;c.  The  soffit  of  the  cupola  is  also  enriched  with 
mouldings.  The  design  of  this  building  was  furnished  by 
Mr.  Mills ;  the  first  American  architect,  regularly  educated  to 
the  profession,  in  this  city.     He  studied  under  Mr.  Latrobe. 

Third  Baptist  Church,  Second  below  Queen  Street. 

Spruce  Street  Baptist  Church,  Spruce  above  Fourth 
Street.  This  building,  as  it  now  stands,  forms  the  most  pro- 
minent architectural  feature  of  the  line  of  Spruce  Street. 
The  original  edifice,  erected  in  1829,  was  considered  a  credi- 
table specimen  of  church  architecture  of  that  date.

The  alterations  which  impart  its  present  imposing  appear- 
ance, consist  in  a  large  addition  to  the  north  end,  and  an  entire 
remodelling  of  the  interior  and  exterior.  The  new  front,  from 
the  design  of  T.  U.  Walter,  Esq.,  United  States  Architect,  at 
Washington,  and  executed  by  his  successor  in  Philadelphia, 


BAPTIST    CHURCHES.  311 

R.  Morris  Smith,  consists  of  a  basement  of  Connecticut  granite, 
11  feet  6  inches  in  height,  over  which  rises  a  principal  story 
or  order,  and  an  attic  order.  The  principal  story  is  28  feet  6 
inches  in  height,  flanked  by  two  square  projections,  and  pene- 
trated in  the  centre  by  the  great  entrance  door,  which  is  20  feet 
in  height,  with  an  entablature  resting  on  heavy  consoles.  This 
story  finishes  in  a  cornice  supported  by  plain  console-modillions, 
and  is  surmounted  by  the  attic  order.  The  cornice  of  this  last, 
forming  the  sky-outline  of  the  building,  is  of  a  bold  and  simple 
character.  Two  cupolas,  rising  to  a  total  height  of  ninety  feet 
above  the  pavement,  adorn  and  finish  the  front,  and  form 
prominent  and  picturesque  objects  in  any  point  of  view. 

The  interior,  executed  from  the  designs  and  under  the  super- 
intendence of  R.  Morris  Smith,  is  governed  by  the  same  cha- 
racter of  massive  grandeur  which  marks  the  exterior.  While 
an  appropriate  style  reigns  throughout,  the  ceiling  is  beauti- 
fully enriched  :  it  is  one  of  the  most  pleasing  in  the  city ; 
where,  in  this  portion  of  the  structure,  a  striking  effect  has  been 
attained  in  the  small  height  of  two  feet,  limited  by  the  position 
of  the  old  joists  and  window-openings,  by  the  following  simple 
arrangement.  A  cornice  of  three  feet  projection  runs  along  the 
tops  of  the  windows,  and  sustains  beyond  it  a  range  of  raised 
panelling  around  the  room,  perforated  by  caissons.  The  large 
ventilator  in  the  centre  is  surrounded  by  a  circle  of  radiating, 
enriched  panels.  Light  to  the  north  gallery  has  been  ob- 
tained through  the  caissons  of  the  ceiling,  from  a  sky-light  in 
the  roof.

BAPTIST    PUBLICATION     SOCIETY.  313 

The  Fourth  African  Baptist  Church,  Lawrence  Court. 

American  Baptist  Publication  Society,  Office  and  De- 
pository, 118  Mulberry  or  Arch  Street.  This  Society  was 
formed  in  1839,  its  object  being  the  publication  and  circulation 
of  Baptist  books  and  periodicals.  The  receipts  for  the  year 
1851,  were  $40,597  71,  of  which  $18,098  were  from  book 
sales.  The  cash  receipts  from  business  operations  paid  all  the 
expenses  incurred  in  stereotyping,  printing,  binding,  salaries 
of  officers,  &amp;c.  During  the  same  year  sixteen  new  publications 
were  stereotyped  or  printed,  embracing  2708  pages,  together 
with  17,250  copies  of  the  Baptist  Almanac,  and  20,000  copies 
of  the  Baptist  Record.  The  present  value  in  books,  &amp;c,  is 
$12,888,  and  in  stereotype  plates,  $11,100. 

The  Association  employ  twenty -seven  colporteur  missiona- 
ries, in  seven  states,  Canada,  and  Oregon,  in  circulating  these 
works;  while  nineteen  ministers  and  Sunday  school  libra- 
ries have  been  furnished.  In  1851,  grants  of  books,  &amp;c, 
were  made  to  the  destitute  in  twenty-three  states,  also  to 
foreign  lands, — viz.,  South  America,  Hayti,  France,  Greece, 
China,  Assam,  Birmah,  &amp;c. 

The  Society's  building  is  a  new  and  ornamental  edifice,  con- 
structed of  brown  sandstone.  The  fagade  has  a  pleasing  ap- 
pearance, without  being  too  ornate  or  expensive.  The  structure 
is  four  stories  high,  the  first  of  which  is  occupied  as  the  Depo- 
sitory ;  the  second  embraces  the  Managers'  room,  and  the  office 
of  the  Corresponding  Secretary.  The  upper  floors  are  used  as 
store-rooms,  &amp;c.  We  understand  that  it  is  in  contemplation 
to  erect  an  addition  to  the  rear  of  the  present  building,  so  as 
to  have  all  the  work  of  the  establishment  done  under  the  imme- 
diate supervision  of  the  officers.

METHODIST    CHURCHES. 

The  first  establishment  of  this  communion  in  Philadelphia, 
was  in  the  year  1769,  by  the  Rev.  Mr.  Pilmore,  then  quite  a 
young  man,  who  was  sent  to  this  city  as  a  missionary,  by  the 
Rev.  John  Wesley.  Mr.  Pilmore  preached  his  first  sermon 
from  the  State  House  steps,  in  Chestnut  Street.  He  was 
early  assisted  in  his  pious  labours  by  a  British  officer,  named 
Webb,  represented  as  a  perfect  Whitfield  in  declamation.  The 
exertions  of  these  gentlemen  were  attended  with  the  most  be- 
neficial results,  in  the  reformation  of  the  poorer  classes,  to 
whom  they  generally  addressed  themselves.  We  are  told  that 
many  districts,  proverbial  for  licentiousness,  became,  through 
their  influence,  examples  of  morality.  The  early  meetings  of 
this  Society  were  held  at  an  inn,  situated  in  a  court,  which 
formerly  ran  from  Arch  to  Cherry,  near  Fourth  Street.  The 
first  building  owned  by  them  was  the  present  St.  George's 
Church,  Fourth  near  New  Street.  They  purchased  it  in  an 
unfinished  state,  the  building  having  been  previously  occupied 
by  the  British,  as  a  cavalry  riding-school.  This  church  was 
long  a  cold  and  dreary-looking  place,  having  been  fitted  up  in 
a  rough  and  temporary  manner.  The  pulpit  stood  about 
twenty  feet  from  the  east  end ; — a  writer  notices  it  as  being 
square,  not  unlike  a  watch-box  with  the  top  sawed  off. 

During  the  early  history  of  this  Society,  it  had  some  re- 
markable revivals.  Several  eminent  preachers  from  New 
York,  Maryland,  and  New  Jersey,  frequently  came  to  assist  in 
the  good  work;  among  whom,  none  were  more  conspicuous 
than  the  celebrated  Benjamin  Abbot,  of  Salem,  New  Jersey. 
He  delighted  to  come  over,  as  he  said,  to  assist  in  keeping  alive 


METHODIST    CHURCHES.  315 

the  fire  kindled  in  the  church  at  Philadelphia.  Mr.  Watson,  in 
his  "Annals,"  describes  Mr.  Abbot  as  an  aged  disciple,  with 
large  and  heavy  eyebrows,  eyes  of  flame,  robust  body,  and  great 
strength  of  voice,  which,  when  exerted  to  the  utmost  while 
preaching,  and  an  occasional  stamp  of  the  foot,  "made  the 
house  ring."  His  eloquence  is  represented  as  fire,  running 
through  the  assembly,  his  voice,  like  a  trumpet  sounding  to 
battle,  amid  the  shouts  of  victory  and  the  cries  of  the  van- 
quished. 

The  clergymen  of  this  branch  of  the  Christian  church  at 
present  in  Philadelphia,  are  generally  men  of  talent,  inferior 
to  none  in  fervour  and  devotion  to  their  high  calling.  Their 
labours  are  eminently  successful, — few  churches  in  our  city 
being  more  frequented  by  larger  or  more  intelligent  audiences; 
none  include  more  active  members. 

The  church  edifices  belonging  to  this  communion,  are  more 
remarkable  for  convenience  than  for  ornamental  display;  yet 
some  of  them  can  boast  of  considerable  architectural  beauty. 

The  following  list  will  be  found  to  comprise  all  those  of  this 
denomination  in  Philadelphia. 

St.  George's  Church,  Fourth  below  New  Street.  This 
was  the  first  established  Methodist  meeting-house  in  this  city.

modern  style,  on  the  north  side  of  Lombard,  between  Thirteenth

Union  Church,  Fourth  below  Arch  Street,  is  one  of  the

Trinity  Church,  Eighth  above  Race  Street,  is  the  most 
beautiful  Methodist  church  in  Philadelphia.  It  differs  from 
the  others  of  this  Society,  in  having  pews  instead  of  free 
sittings. 

Western  Church,  Schuylkill  Third  below  Walnut  Street.

tributed throughout  the  county, — making  a  total  of  fifty-three 
buildings. 

LUTHERAN    CHURCHES. 

The  first  church  of  this  communion  in  Philadelphia  was 
erected  in  1743.  It  yet  remains,  in  Fifth  above  Arch  Street. 
This  antique  edifice  is  seventy-two  feet  by  forty-four,  and 
twenty-two  feet  high  to  the  eaves.  During  the  occupancy  of 
the  city  by  the  British,  in  1777,  it  was  the  garrison-church ; 
and,  after  the  victory  achieved  by  the  Army  of  Independence 
at  Yorktown,  Congress  went  to  it  in  a  body,  to  return  thanks 
to  G-od.  For  a  long  period  the  services  in  this  church  were 
performed  in  the  German  language ;  but,  owing  to  the  in- 
creased number  of  members  who  did  not  learn  the  language  of 
their  ancestors,  an  attempt  was  made  to  have  the  services  per- 
formed, at  least  once  a  day,  in  the  English  language.     This

measure  was  resisted,  and,  in  consequence,  a  large  party  with- 
drew, and  erected  the  elegant 

St.  John's  Church,  in  Race  Street,  between  Fifth  and 
Sixth  Streets.  This  is  an  imposing  edifice,  in  the  Roman 
style  of  architecture ;  it  is  of  brick,  one  hundred  feet  by  sixty- 
seven. 

Zion  Church,  situated  on  the  southeast  corner  of  Cherry 
and  Fourth  Streets,  is  one  of  the  most  substantially-erected 
and  commodious  churches  in  Philadelphia.  It  is  also  of 
brick,  of  the  Roman  style,  and  is  one  hundred  and  seven  feet 
long,  seventy-one  broad,  and  forty-four  feet  to  the  spring 
of  the  roof.  It  was  intended  to  surmount  this  edifice  with  a 
steeple,  the  tower  of  which  was  partly  erected  with  the  build-

ing  in  1766.  In  1777,  the  British  army  removed  the  pews, 
and  occupied  the  building  as  a  temporary  hospital.  This 
church  was  destroyed  by  fire  on  the  26th  of  December,  1794 ; 
but  the  walls  remaining  entire  and  sound,  it  was  rebuilt  and 
much  improved  in  1795.  The  organ  is  one  of  the  largest  and 
best-toned  in  the  city. 

St.  Matthew's  Church,  New  below  Fourth  Street. 

German  Lutheran  Church,  Fourth  below  Thompson 
Street. 

Zion  and  St.  Michael's,  Brown  and  St.  John  Streets.

ing, situated  on  the  south  side  of  Spring  Garden  Street,  west 
of  Thirteenth  Street.  It  is  a  brick  structure,  masticated.  The 
front  presents  a  fine  specimen  of  the  Romanesque  style  of  ar- 
chitecture, characterized  at  once  for  simplicity  and  taste. 

Lutheran  Church,  Queen  and  Main  Streets,  German- 
town. 

St.  Michael's  Church,  Main  Street,  Germantown. 

There  is  also  a  Lutheran  Church  in  Frankford,  one  in  Box- 
borough,  and  one  in  Passyunk. 

GERMAN   REFORMED    CHURCHES. 

The  early  establishment  of  this  denomination  in  Philadel- 
phia County  was  in  Germantown,  where  they  erected  a  meet- 
ing-house in  1733. 

The  First  German  Beformed  Church  erected  in  our 
city  was  in  Bace  below  Fourth  Street,  in  1747.  This  edifice 
was  octagonal  in  form,  surmounted  by  a  spire.  It  was  removed 
in  1762,  and  a  more  commodious  one  erected,  which,  in  1837, 
gave  place  to  the  present  neat  brick  structure. 

German  Beformed  Church,  St.  John  near  Green  Street.

that  of  any  other  church  in  the  city,  in  point  of  taste  and 
finish. 


UNIVERSALIST    CHURCHES.  321 


MORAVIAN   CHURCH. 

The  first  congregation  of  this  communion  that  settled  in 
North  America,  came  from  Berthelsdorf,  a  village  belonging 
to  Count  Zinzendorf,  in  Upper  Lusatia,  whence  they  were  ex- 
pelled by  the  Elector  of  Saxony.  The  instructions  given  to 
these  exiles  by  the  Count  is  worthy  of  notice.  "  Submit  your- 
selves," he  said,  "  in  all  things,  to  the  guidance  of  God ;  pre- 
serve your  liberty  of  conscience ;  but  avoid  all  religious  dis- 
putes. Ever  keep  in  view  the  call  given  you  by  God, — to 
preach  the  gospel  of  Christ  to  the  heathen;  and,  further,  en- 
deavour as  much  as  possible  to  earn  your  own  bread."  The 
first  colony  arrived  in  Pennsylvania  in  1738,  the  larger  portion 
of  which  settled  at  Bethlehem.  In  1742,  the  members  of  the 
Society  who  had  remained  in  Philadelphia  erected  the  church 
which  still  stands  on  the  corner  of  Race  and  Bread  Streets. 
The  Moravians,  though  few  in  number  when  compared  with 
other  sects,  are  yet  noted  for  piety  and  industry.  The  burial- 
ground  belonging  to  this  church  is  situated  on  the  corner  of 
Vine  and  Franklin  Streets.

building  is  eighty  feet  long,  sixty  wide,  and  thirty-four  high 
to  the  spring  of  the  roof.  The  interior  is  neat,  and  the  pulpit 
is  handsomely  decorated. 

The  Third  Universalist  Church  is  a  plain  structure, 
situated  in  Phoenix  near  Amber  Street,  Kensington.

THE   BIBLE. 

Around  the  Bible  centre  a  thousand  lovely  associations, 
thoughts,  and  feelings.  It  is  the  source  of  all  true  and  lasting 
knowledge — the  only  true  guide  to  happiness.  The  blessings 
of  liberty  and  civilization  cluster  around  and  lie  in  its  path. 
Where  the  Bible  is  read,  there  are  wholesome  laws,  civil  pros- 
perity, and  social  endearments.  It  is  a  teacher  in  schools,  a 
counsellor  in  senates,  and  a  cheerful  friend  at  the  fireside.  It 
gives  wisdom  to  the  ignorant,  confidence  to  the  doubting,  joy 
to  the  comfortless,  light  to  the  straying,  and  hope  to  the  hope- 
less. 

The  diffusion  of  the  Bible  in  our  midst,  together  with  the 
means  of  its  distribution,  are  here  noticed. 

The  first  of  these  Institutions  to  which  we  direct  attention,  is 

The  Pennsylvania  Bible  Society,  which  was  established 


BIBLE    SOCIETIES.  325 

forty-three  years  ago.  This  noble  Association  has  circulated  in 
this  state,  since  1840,  about  500,000  copies  of  the  Sacred  Scrip- 
tures. The  number  issued  during  the  past  year,  was  38,583. 
The  receipts  in  the  same  period,  have  amounted  to  826,897  85. 
It  has  in  connexion  with  it  120  auxiliaries  throughout  the 
state. 

Orders  and  communications  should  be  addressed  to  Wilfred 
Hall,  Depository  Agent,  144  Chestnut  Street. 

The  Philadelphia  Bible  Society,  formed  in  1838, 
stands  in  the  position  of  a  county  organization.  Its  particular 
duty  is  the  supplying  of  those  who  are  destitute  of  the  Scrip- 
tures within  the  streets,  courts,  lanes,  and  alleys  of  Philadel- 
phia. The  hardy  sons  of  the  deep  are  also  the  subjects  of  its 
peculiar  care.  We  may  here  remark,  that  "  The  Book,"  is 
published  in  all  the  modern  languages,  so  that  emigrants  and 
sailors,  from  all  climes,  can  be  supplied  with  it  in  their  own 
tongue. 

During  the  past  year,  Bibles  and  Testaments  have  been  dis- 
tributed in  the  G-erman,  Swedish,  Danish,  Italian,  Portuguese, 
Greek,  and  Welsh  languages.  This  Society  employs  four  col- 
porteurs, or  missionaries,  in  this  good  work. 

The  Female  Bible  Society  or  Philadelphia,  insti- 
tuted April  24th,  1814.  The  members  of  this  Association 
not  only  contribute  their  money,  but  aid  in  the  circulation  of 
the  Bible  personally.  The  Society  is  divided  into  a  number 
of  auxiliaries,  distributed  throughout  the  county,  each  of 
which  is  a  separate  and  distinct  organization,  yet  united  in  a 
bond  of  general  union  for  mutual  support.  These  auxiliaries 
are,  the  Northwestern,  Southwestern,  Southeastern,  South- 
wark,  Moyamensing,  West  Kensington,  and  Spring  Garden 
Societies. 

All  communications  to  these  Bible  Societies,  should  be  ad- 
dressed to  the  Depository,  144  Chestnut  Street.

326  PHILADELPHIA    AS    IT    IS. 

In  addition  to  those  mentioned,  there  are  The  Northern 
Liberties  Bible  Society,  Germantown  Female  Bible 
Society,  Frankford  Bible  Society,  and  Manayunk  and 
Roxborough  Female  Bible  Society. 

We  may  here  remark,  for  general  information,  that  the 
various  Bible  societies  established  since  1804,  in  different 
parts  of  the  world,  have  issued  no  less  than  40,000,000  copies 
of  the  Holy  Scriptures, — the  United  States  raising  alone  for 
that  noble  cause,  during  the  past  year,  $1,750,000.  It  is 
printed  in  no  less  than  130  different  languages,  now  spoken 
by  the  principal  varieties  of  the  human  family. 

The  Bible  Association  of  the  Friends  in  America, 
was  founded  in  1829,  for  the  purpose  of  encouraging  "a  wider 
circulation,  as  well  as  a  more  frequent  and  serious  perusal, 
of  the  Sacred  Scriptures,  among  such  as  are  members  of  the 
Religious  Society  of  Friends,  and  also,  as  its  funds  will  permit, 
to  other  persons." 

Since  the  establishment  of  this  Association,  they  have 
printed  23,350  copies  of  the  Reference  Bible,  12,530  of  the 
24mo.  school  Bible,  15,196  of  the  12mo.  Testament,  and  5,768 
of  the  24mo.  Testament.  These  books  are  circulated  through 
auxiliaries  in  different  parts  of  the  continent. 

The  Depository  is  at  No.  50  North  Fourth  Street,  above 
Arch.  Mr.  John  Richardson  is  the  agent,  to  whom  communi- 
cations should  be  addressed.

of  the  building,  into  two  extensive  stores,  the  west  one  of 
which  is  occupied  by  the  Society  as  their  Depository  and  Pub- 
lication Office. 

Few  institutions  in  our  city  are  better  calculated  to  promote 
the  cause  of  Christianity  than  the  one  under  notice.  Its 
influence  is  not  bounded  by  "locality"  or  "sect;"  it  is  truly 
American. 

The  "  Union"  was  formed  in  1824,  by  the  combination  of 
several  local  associations,  having  for  their  object  "The  con- 
centration of  the  efforts  of  Sunday  School  societies  in  different 
sections  of  the  United  States,  together  with  the  diffusion  of 
useful  information  by  moral  and  religious  publications,  mis- 
sions," &amp;c. 

According  to  the  Constitution,  the  Union  is  composed  of 
the  various  evangelical  denominations.  No  control  is  assumed 
by  it  over  any  school  whatever,  the  principal  and  primary 
object  being  to  aid  and  encourage  the  establishment  of  Sab- 
bath Schools  throughout  the  United  States,  without  any  inter- 
ference in  their  future  organization  or  government. 

MISCELLANEOUS    ASSOCIATIONS. 

Masonic  Lodges. — These,  at  present,  include  a  Grand 
Lodge,  three  Mark  Lodges,  a  Grand  Chapter,  three  subordi- 
nate Chapters,  and  twenty-three  subordinate  Lodges,  in  Phila- 
delphia and  adjoining  districts. 

The  Masonic  Hall  is  situated  in  Third  Street,  between 
Walnut  and  Spruce  Streets. 

In  the  year  1809,  the  large  Gothic  edifice  on  Chestnut 
Street,  between  Seventh  and  Eighth  Streets,  known  as  "  The 
Masonic  Hall,"  was  erected.  "We  learn  that  the  Order  have 
in  contemplation  the  removal  of  this  building,  and  the  erection 
on  its  site  of  another,  which  will  be,  not  only  more  adapted  to

the  accommodation  of  the  numerous  lodges,  &amp;c,  but  an  orna- 
ment to  the  city. 

Independent  Order  of  Odd  Fellows. — Of  this  excellent 
Order,  there  are  one  hundred  and  fourteen  Lodges,  embracing 
over  twenty  thousand  members,  in  the  city  and  adjoining  dis- 
tricts. Many  of  the  halls  erected  in  different  sections  of  Phi- 
ladelphia County,  for  the  use  and  accommodation  of  the  Order, 
are  beautiful,  chaste,  and  commodious  buildings.  The  most 
prominent  of  these  is  the

Odd  Fellows'  Hall,  Sixth  Street  between  Arch  and  Race 
Streets.  This  structure,  sixty-two  feet  front  by  one  hundred 
in  depth,  is  quite  imposing  in  its  appearance. 

Odd  Fellows'  Hall,  Third  and  Brown  Streets,  Northern 
Liberties,  is  also  an  elegant  building,  in  the  Egyptian  style  of 
architecture. 


MISCELLANEOUS    ASSOCIATIONS.  329 

Odd  Fellows'  Hall,  Broad  and  Spring  Garden  Streets. — 
This  new  hall,  creditable  to  the  enterprise  of  the  Order,  and 
an  ornament  to  its  vicinity,  was  erected  in  1851.  In  addition 
to  these,  there  is  a  hall,  erected  in  1850,  at  the  corner  of 
Tenth  and  South  Streets ;  one  in  Third  below  German  Street ; 
one  in  West  Philadelphia,  one  in  Germantown,  one  in  Rox- 
borough,  and  two  in  Manayunk. 

Among  the  many  associations  in  Philadelphia,  we  may 
mention,  The  United  Order  of  American  Mechanics, 
The  Druids,  The  Independent  Order  of  Good  Fellows, 
and  The  Improved  Order  of  Red  Men,  as  worthy  of  parti- 
cular regard,  being  organized  for  the  purpose  of  cultivating 
the  principles  of  Friendship  and  Benevolence  among  their 
members. 

The  Mutual  Beneficial  Societies  in  Philadelphia  are, 
also,  exceedingly  numerous.  Their  names  alone  would  far 
surpass  our  limits. 

Temperance  Societies. — We  rejoice  to  see  this  cause 
again  awakening  a  lively  interest  in  our  city,  where  it  ever 
has  had  many  ardent  friends.  Among  the  Temperance  orga- 
nizations in  Philadelphia,  The  Order  of  the  Sons  of  Tem- 
perance, The  Independent  Order  of  Good  Samaritans, 
The  Cadets  of  Temperance,  The  Pupils  of  Temperance, 
The  Daughters  of  Temperance,  and  The  Daughters  of 
Samaria,  are  worthy  of  notice.  These  and  kindred  associa- 
tions are  the  pioneers  of  a  glorious,  peaceful  age.  When  we 
reflect  on  the  vast  sums  that  have  been  squandered  in  intoxi- 
cating drink,  which  has  been  the  means  of  so  much  misery,  wick- 
edness, and  brutality — how  Intemperance  stands  in  the  way  of 
man's  social  progress — how  it  thwarts  every  good  and  bene- 
volent design — what  innocence  it  has  defiled — what  hopes 
blighted,  and  homes  made  desolate, — can  we  do  otherwise  than 
wish  them  God  speed?

CHAPTER  IX. 

CEMETERIES    OF    PHILADELPHIA   AND    ITS    VICINITY. 

Some  of  these  cemeteries  are  the  "  loveliest  spots  upon 
earth/'  and  they  ought  to  be  so.  We  love  the  beautiful  while 
living,  and  it  is  a  pleasing  thought  that  when  our  journey  is 
over,  we  shall  be  laid  amid  the  loveliness  of  Nature.  Alex- 
ander Wilson's  last  wish  was  to  be  laid  beneath  a  shady 
tree,  where  the  songsters  that  charmed  him  while  living,  might 
come  and  sing  around  his  tomb !  Poor  Wilson !  even  your 
last  hope  on  earth  has  been  disappointed ;  few  birds  carol  around 
your  grave.  The  solitude  you  loved  has  long  ago  deserted 
your  lowly  bed.* 

We  propose  to  notice  some  of  the  most  prominent  cemeteries 
in  our  city  and  its  vicinity. 

LAUREL    HILL    CEMETERY.f 

"  Here  may  the  heart,  half  desolate  and  hroken, 
Far  from  the  city's  pomp  its  vigil  keep, 
And  wreath  with  fairest  flowers,  affection's  token, 
The  pale,  cold  marble,  where  its  loved  ones  sleep." 

This  cemetery  is  beautifully  situated  between  the  Ridge 
Road  and  the  Riyer  Schuylkill,  about  three  and  a  half  miles 
from  Philadelphia.  It  consists  of  two  sections,  designated  re- 
spectively North  and  South  Laurel  Hill. 

*  Alexander  Wilson,  the  Ornithologist,  died  in  this  city  in  the  year  1814,  and  is 
buried  in  the  Swedes'  Churchyard,  Southwark.  The  testimonial  to  his  memory  is  a 
plain  marble  slab,  easily  distinguished  among  the  few  humble  monuments  in  that 
old  ground.

R.  A.  Smith,  the  first  part  of  which,  "Laurel  Hill  Cemetery,"  will  be  published  at  an

The  grounds  of  the  North  section  (which  first  claims  our 
attention)  are  substantially  enclosed,  and  the  whole  plot  sur- 
veyed into  lots  of  various  dimensions,  from  eighty  to  one 
thousand  square  feet.  The  improvements  consist  of  an  elegant 
entrance,  constructed  of  brown  stone,  in  the  Doric  style;  a 
Grothic  chapel;  the  superintendent's  residence;  a  spacious  re-

flowers,  plants,  and  shrubs  of  every  variety  are  cultivated  with 
the  greatest  care.  The  entrance  on  the  Ridge  Road  presents

defaced.  Beneath  these  memorials  lie  the  ashes  of  Thomas 
Godfrey,  the  inventor  of  the  Mariner's  Quadrant,  together 
with  those  of  his  father  and  mother. 

The  monument  was  erected  by  the  Mercantile  Library  Com- 
pany of  Philadelphia,  aided  by  citizens  of  Philadelphia  and 
Germantown,  in  gratitude  for  the  enduring  benefit  his  inven- 
tion has  conferred  upon  the  navigation  and  commerce  of  the 
world. 

In  the  northeast  corner  of  the  cemetery  is  the  burial-ground 
attached  to  St.  John's  Lutheran  Church. 

Following  the  carriage-road,  to  the  left  we  view  the  chaste 
and  ornamental  tomb  of  Oscar  Douglass,  a  Philadelphia 
fireman,  killed  by  the  falling  of  a  wall,  while  in  the  discharge 
of  his  duty,  January  23d,  1841.  This  monument  was  erected 
as  a  tribute  to  his  many  virtues,  by  his  fellow-members  of  the 
Pennsylvania  Fire  Company.  West  of  this  is  the  rich  and 
imposing  tribute  to  the  memory  of  the  brave  and  lamented 
General  and  Major  Twiggs,  father  and  son ;  both  fell  in 
the  recent  war  with  Mexico.  In  this  vicinity,  too,  repose  the 
ashes  of  the  poet,  the  scholar,  and  divine — Walter  Colton. 
A  plain  obelisk  marks  his  last  resting-place. 

Innumerable  monuments  are  tastefully  disposed  in  this 
neighbourhood — some  of  them  being  exquisite  works  of  art; 
while  trees,  shrubs,  and  flowers,  of  every  variety  and  hue, 
throw  a  delicious  shade  around.  Among  these  tombs  is  the 
figure  of  a  lovely  child,  a  master-piece  of  the  celebrated  sculp- 
tor, Pettrich.  It  is  much  visited,  and  generally  admired.  No 
less  beautiful,  though  more  humble  in  pretension,  is  that  to 
"  Our  Dear  Willie." 

We  are  now  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Gothic  Chapel,  the  scene 
in  front  of  which  is  one  of  unparalleled  loveliness.  In  such  a 
pleasing  spot,  when  the  birds  are  singing,  and  flowers  and

In  this  vicinity  may  be  seen  an  obelisk, 
bearing  an  epitaph  to  the  memory  of  John 
Cook,  written  by  himself,  the  lettering  and 
execution  of  which  is  highly  creditable  to 
the  artist,  John  Eckstein,  Esq.  The  lot 
(too  limited  in  extent  and  badly  arranged 
for  the  proper  exhibition  of  a  monument  of 
this  description)  is  enclosed  by  a  tasty  and 
substantial  iron  railing,  and  embellished 
with  some  choice  shrubs  and  plants. 

To  the  right  of  this,  Mr.  Louis  A.  Godey 
has  a  lot,  ornamented  with  true  poetic  taste. 
Proceeding  westward,  the  visiter  will  not  fail 
to  admire  the  tomb  erected  over  the  remains 
of  Joseph  S.  Lewis.  On  the  south  front 
of  this  elegant  monument  is  an  admirable  view  of  Fairmount. 

North  from  this,  is  the  classic  tomb  of  Commodore  Hull, 
executed  after  the  model  of  that  of  the  Scipios  at  Rome,  with 
the  addition  of  the  American  Eagle,  perched  on  the  centre. 
Beneath  this  beautiful  and  appropriate  memorial  repose  the 
ashes  of  that  naval  hero;  who,  by  his  brilliant  triumph,  in  the 
frigate  Constitution,  over  the  British  frigate  Guerriere,  Captain 
Dacres,  on  the  19th  of  August,  1812,  "became  the  precursor 
of  that  series  of  victories  which  immortalized  the  Navy  of  the 
United  States."  The  tomb  was  erected  by  his  widow,  as  an 
affectionate  token  to  his  private  virtues. 

In  the  adjoining  lot,  to  the  east  of  Commodore  Hull's  tomb, 
rest  the  remains  of  Commodore  A.  Murray.  They  were 
originally  interred  in  the  burial-ground  of  the  First  Presby- 
terian Church,  Market  Street  below  Third  (the  site  of  which 
is  now  occupied  by  extensive  storehouses),  and  removed  to 
Laurel  Hill  in  1844,  by  direction  of  his  family.

East  from  this,  beauti- 
fully situated,  is  the  monu- 
ment of  Stephen  Decatur 
Lav  alette,  U.  S.  N.  It  is 
in  the  Roman  style,  and 
consists  of  a  large,  square 
pedestal,  on  which  rests  a 
block  of  marble,  with  medal- 
lions on  each  side,  bearing 
appropriate  naval  emblems, 
— the  flag,  anchor,  &amp;c,  the 
whole  surmounted  by  an 
urn. 

Proceeding  to  the  west- 
ward, immediately  over  the 
first  terrace,  is  the  monu- 
ment erected  to  the  memory 
of  Ferdinand  Rudolph 
Hassler,  a  native  of  Swit- 
zerland, and  a  distinguished 
citizen  of  the  United  States, 
for  many  years  engaged  in 
the  Coast  Survey,  as  superintendent,  for  which  responsible  office 
he  was  well  suited,  no  less  for  his  learning  and  scientific  re- 
search, than  for  his  natural  talents.  The  memorial  consists 
of  two  pieces  of  rock  in  the  rough,  surmounted  by  a  pedestal 
and  urn,  elegantly  sculptured  in  marble.  Alongside  of  this 
tomb  repose  the  ashes  of  Charles  A.  Hassler,  Surgeon 
U.  S.  N.  This  gallant  officer  perished,  when  returning  from 
a  protracted  cruise,  in  the  noble  effort  to  save  the  helpless  on 
the  wreck  of  the  steamer  Atlantic,  in  Long  Island  Sound, 
November  27th,  1846. 

Proceeding   northward,    we   view   the   grave   of  William

Short,  the  first  citizen  who  received  an  appointment  to  public 
office  under  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States — also  the 
tomb  of  the  McKean  family,  where  repose  the  ashes  of  Thomas 
McKean,  one  of  the  signers  of  the  Declaration  of  Indepen- 
dence, and  President  of  Congress  in  1781 ;  subsequently  Chief 
Justice  of  the  United  States  and  Governor  of  the  State  of 
Pennsylvania.  His  memory  will  ever  be  dear  to  the  American 
citizen,  and  his  tomb  one  of  the  most  interesting  objects  in 
this  cemetery. 

In  this  vicinity,  too,  is  the  last  resting-place  of  John 
Carlton,  a  native  of  Salem,  Massachusetts,  a  Major  in  the 
Array  of  the  Revolution ;  and  likewise  that  of  J.  W.  Cox, 
U.  S.  N.  The  memorial  to  the  last-named  is  a  plain  shaft, 
surmounted  by  a  Bible  and  an  open  Prayer-book.  Nearly 
opposite  to  these  is  the  splendid  monument  to  William 
Drayton,  of  South  Carolina ;  and  in  the  extreme  northwest 
corner,  that  of  M.  Morgan,  M.D.,  Surgeon  U.  S.  N. 

Dr.  Morgan  was  a  favourite  in  the  Navy,  and  his  death  was 
much  regretted.  He  died  at  Pensacola  in  1841.  The  monu- 
ment was  erected  by  his  naval  friends,  who  had  his  remains 
brought  by  sea  from  Florida.  The  lot  is  neatly  enclosed  by 
four  cannons,  linked  together  with  chains. 

Directly  east  from  this  is  seen  the  noble  granite  obelisk 
which  marks  the  spot  where  repose  the  ashes  of  the  lamented 
Holden,  formerly  of  the  "  Saturday  Courier." 

Descending  the  declivity,  immediately  beside  the  northern 
boundary,  to  the  first  terrace,  the  lover  of  the  picturesque  will 
be  gratified  with  the  rural  and  wild  character  of  the  scenery. 
The  west,  or  river  front,  is  still  left  to  the  care  of  Nature,  and 
for  the  most  part,  is  covered  with  a  fine  growth  of  forest  trees. 
The  south  portion  is  laid  out  in  terraces.  The  north,  or  that 
portion  below,  is  only  here  and  there  intersected  by  rugged

paths,  the  rocks  rising  from  the  water  in  some  parts  abruptly. 
Here,  stranger,  pause  and  look  around  ! 

"Hushed  as  this  scene  thy  accents  be  ; 
The  voiceless  solitude  of  death 
Breathes  more  than  mortal  majesty." 

Proceeding  southwardly  along  this  terrace,  we  meet  several 
lots  tastefully  enclosed,  provided  with  rustic  seats ;  they  are 
all  remarkable  for  their  simplicity  and  beauty  of  ornament,  as 
well  as  chasteness  of  sentiment  and  real  feeling  engraved  on 
the  memorials.  A  little  in  advance  from  these  rises  the  stately 
monument  erected  to  the  memory  of  John  H.  Betjsse,  for- 
merly of  South  Carolina ;  facing  which  is  the  mausoleums  of 
the  Lennig,  Backus,  and  Robertson  families.     Near  this 

"  There  is  a  lone  and  silent  shade, 

Where  none  but  reverent  footsteps  tread ; 
There,  Neal,  the  loved,  is  calmly  laid, 

And  sleeps  the  slumbers  of  the  dead. 
Oh  I  sadly  sighs  the  evening  breeze 

Above  the  author's  lonely  tomb, 
And  sadly  droops  the  murmuring  trees, 

As  though  they  mourned  his  early  doom." 

Joseph  C.  Neal  lies  in  a  sequestered  spot,  immediately  in 
front  of  the  Ball  Mausoleum.  The  monument  consists  of  a 
rough  block  of  marble,  surmounted  by  an  urn,  against  which 
reclines  a  stringless  lyre ;  below  is  a  marble  tablet  in  the  form 
of  a  shield.  This  monument — fit  memorial  of  the  poet — was 
erected  as  a  tribute  of  affectionate  regret  by  those  who  loved 
him  as  a  man  and  admired  him  as  an  author.  The  lot  is 
handsomely  enclosed  by  artistic  marble  posts,  connected  by 
massy  iron  rails. 

Beneath  this,  on  a  craggy  point,  rises  a  granite  obelisk,  in 
the  form  of  "  Cleopatra's  Needle/'  twenty-one  feet  high.  This 
monument,  together  with  its  situation,  is  peculiarly  suitable  to

corameni orate  such  a  character  as  Charles  Thomson,  the 
first,  and  long  the  confidential  Secretary  of  the  Continental 
Congress. 

Retracing  our  steps  to  the  upland,  we  now  pursue  our 
walk  along  the  terrace  southward.  The  quantity  and  variety 
of  roses,  shrubs,  &amp;c,  along  this  path  and  vicinity  present  a 
most  enchanting  scene. 

The  southern  portion  of  the  cemetery,  is  full  of  chaste  and 
beautiful  memorials  to 

"The  dead,  the  dead,  the  cherished  dead." 

Among*  which  we  notice  the  monuments  erected  by  the 
Pennsylvania  Institution  for  the  Instruction  of  the  Blind,  to 
the  memory  of  Julius  R.  Friedlander,  the  founder  of  that 
noble  charity,  and  to  William  Young  Birch,  one  of  its  early 
friends  and  most  munificent  benefactors.  The  first  is  a  plain 
granite  obelisk;  the  other,  a  beautifully-executed  shaft,  sur- 
mounted by  an  urn ;  both  are  merited  testimonials  of  regard  to 
pure  philanthropy  and  disinterested  devotion. 

Near  these  is  the  rich  and  imposing  Gothic  Monument, 
so  generally  visited  and  justly  admired;  it  is  erected  to  the 
memory  of  three  sisters, — 


"  Whose  lives,  so  dearly  cherished, 
Nor  father's  prayers,  nor  mother's  love  could  save ; 
For  He,  our  refuge,  when  all  else  hath  perished, 
In  love  still  taketh,  what  in  love  he  gave." 


To  the  admirers  of  architecture,  this  monument  will  prove 
a  treat.  It  was  designed  by  and  executed  under  the  superin- 
tendence of  Mr.  John  Notman. 

Proceeding  eastward,  we  view  the  classic  tomb,  erected 
over  the  remains  of  Isabel  Coleman,  daughter  of  Thomas  and

Hannah  Coleman.  This  exquisite  work  of  art.  is  from  the 
chisel  of  Joseph  Maples,  Esq.,  sculptor,  and  is  a  most  beauti- 
ful specimen  of  American  Art.  It  is  undoubtedly  the  gem  of 
North  Laurel  Hill.     (See  engraving.) 

We  must  now  bid  adieu  to  this  delightful  place — 

"  Where,  perchance,  our  footsteps  never 
Its  fairy  haunts  again  in  life  may  tread  ; 
Yet,  as  a  gem,  in  memory's  casket  ever 
Art  thou  shrined,  oh,  loveliest  city  of  the  dead." 

South  Laurel  Hill,  to  which  we  now  direct  our  steps,  is  also 
a  charming  spot.  This  new  cemetery,  like  North  Laurel  Hill, 
occupies  a  lofty  promontory  above  the  river, — the  views  of 
which,  and  through  the  sombre  glades  and  avenues  of  the 
ground,  are  unsurpassed  for  sweetness  and  repose;  nowhere 
could  a  more  attractive  spot  be  found  for  the  purposes  of 
burial.  Several  elegant  monuments  have  already  been  erected, 
the  most  prominent  of  which  is  that  raised  to  the  memory  of 
"  Sarah  Ann,  wife  of  George  L.  Harrison,  who  fell  asleep 
May  12th,  1850. "  It  is  of  marble,  in  the  decorated  style  of 
Gothic  architecture,  which  prevailed  during  the  reigns  of 
Edward  the  Second  and  Edward  the  Third  of  England, — a 
period  when  this  rich  and  imposing  order  was  carried  to  its 
highest  degree  of  perfection  and  luxuriant  beauty.  About 
that  time,  also,  the  canopy  was  introduced  as  a  new  feature  in 
monumental  decoration.  The  tomb  under  notice  consists  of 
a  richly-sculptured  altar  table,  surmounted  by  an  elegant 
canopy,  enriched  with  crochets  and  finials,  supported  by  twenty 
clustered  columns ;  festoons  of  ivy  creep  along  each  angle  of 
the  roof  until  they  meet  at  the  apex,  where  they  unite  in  an 
ornamental  cluster.  "Within  the  screen  is  the  life-size  image 
of  a  lamb,  reposing  on  a  cross,  emblematic  of  that  faith  en- 
deared to  her  whose  remains  lie  beneath.     The  whole  structure

ODD     FELLOWS'     CEMETERY. 


The  Odd  Fellows'  Cemetery  is  situated  on  Islington  Lane, 
near  the  Ridge  Road,  about  two  miles  from  the  northern  boun- 
dary of  the  city  proper-  It  contains  thirty-two  acres,  and  is 
intersected  by  spacious  avenues  of  from  fifteen  to  thirty  feet  in 
width,  well  graded.  A  substantial  stone  wall,  surmounted  by 
a  neat  iron  railing,  has  been  erected  along  the  entire  front. 
The  first  interment  was  made  on  the  5th  of  May,  1849.  The 
Cemetery  is  under  the  management  of  the  Order  whose  name 
it  bears.

The  buildings  of  which  the  above  is  a  correct  and  beautiful 
view,  are  located  in  the  centre  of  the  ground,  fronting  on  the 
Lane.  They  are  of  brown  stone,  in  the  Egyptian  style  of 
architecture.  The  centre  building,  surmounted  by  a  tower 
eighty-one  feet  high,  is  designed  for  a  chapel,  with  offices  and 
ample  apartments  for  the  residence  of  the  superintendent; 
the  wings  are  used  for  carriage  ways  and  entrances  for  foot 
passengers. 

These  beautiful  and  appropriate  buildings  were  designed 
and  erected  under  the  superintendence  of  Hoxie  and  Button, 
architects. 

Glenwood  Cemetery,  Ridge  Road  and  Islington  Lane, 
contains  twenty-one  acres.  It  is  situated  exactly  on  the  ridge 
that  divides  the  waters  flowing  into  the  Delaware  from  those 
flowing  into  the  Schuylkill.  The  avenues  are  laid  out  so  as  to 
combine  beauty  of  appearance,  with  ready  access  to  every  part 
of  the  ground.  When  the  designed  improvements  (part  of 
which  we  had  the  pleasure  of  inspecting)  are  completed, 
"The  Glenwood"  will  be  one  of  the  most  beautiful,  as  it  is 
now  one  of  the  most  desirable  places  of  burial  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  city. 

The  Monument  Cemetery  is  beautifully  situated  on  Broad 
Street,  about  a  mile  above  Coates  Street.  It  combines  every- 
thing in  a  natural  point  of  view  which  could  possibly  be 
desired,  being  high,  dry,  and  at  so  convenient  a  distance  from 
the  city  as  to  be  easily  reached  on  foot. 

The  front  presents  a  tasty  and  appropriate  appearance.  On 
entering,  the  natural  beauty  of  the  spot,  embellished  as  it  is 
by  art,  renders  the  view  altogether  lovely.  Here,  as  at  Laurel 
Hill,  numerous  trees  throw  their  shade  around,  and  flowers 
both  rare  and  fragrant  deck  the  grave. 

Among  the  most  notable  monuments  in  this  Cemetery,  is 
that  erected  to  the  memory  of  William  De  La  Mater  Caldwell,

WOODLAND     CEMETERY. 


361 


The  Woodland  Cemetery 
is  situated  on  the  west  side  of 
the  Schuylkill  River,  about  one 
mile  southwest  from  the  city. 
This  beautiful  spot  was  long 
the  country  seat  of  the  Hamilton 
family ;  and  the  mansion  still  re- 
mains, a  memorial  of  the  past. 
The  trees  that  adorn  the  Cemetery 
are  some  of  them  of  majestic 
growth,  lending  to  the  scenery  and 
the  grounds  the  most  impressive 
effect.  The  vistas  beneath  the 
foliage,  or  between  the  separated 
groves,  conduct  the  eye  to  distant 
prospects,  varied  on  every  hand, 
and  by  every  change  of  position; 
there,  the  spires  and  public  build- 
ings of  the  city  are  beheld  j  here,  the  windings  of  the  Schuyl- 
kill ;  and  more  distant,  the  bright  surface  of  the  Delaware 
and  the  blue  hills  of  New  Jersey  skirt  the  horizon ;  while 
flowers  and  shrubs  are  scattered  plenteously  around,  shedding 
a  cheering  influence  in  shaded  lawns,  or  among  the  tombs.

All  that  taste  can  suggest  or  science  demand,  consistently  with 
the  solemn  purpose  of  the  place,  has  been  added  to  the  superior 
advantages  already  possessed.

ance of  a  couch.  They  are  further  enhanced  by  the  profusion 
of  roses  and  other  choice  flowers  which  cover  the  mound. 

The  Cemetery  includes  about  eighty  acres  of  land,  of  the 
very  best  quality  for  burial  purposes.  It  was  incorporated  in 
the  year  1840. 

Omnibuses  run  from  the  Exchange  to  within  a  square  of

CHAPTER  X. 

THE    CITY   GOVERNMENT. 

This  is  composed  of  a  Police  Department,  Select  and  Com- 
mon Councils,  Board  of  City  Commissioners,  and  a  Board  of 
City  and  County  Commissioners.  The  Police  Department 
consists  of  a  Mayor,  Clerk  of  Police,  Lieutenant  of  Police, 
four  Special  Constables,  four  High  Constables,  thirty-four  day 
policemen,  four  captains,  four  lieutenants,  two  hundred  watch- 
men, and  fifty-seven  lamp-lighters. 

The  Day  Police  is  divided  into  four  districts,  viz. — Dis- 
trict No.  1,  extending  from  Cedar  to  Chestnut  Street,  and 
from  the  Delaware  to  the  east  side  of  Ninth  Street.  Police 
station,  Union  Street  below  Fourth,  south  side. 

District  No.  2,  extending  from  Chestnut  to  Vine,  and 
from  the  Delaware  to  Ninth  Street.  Station  house,  Cherry 
above  Fourth  Street,  north  side. 

District  No.  3,  extending  from  Cedar  to  Chestnut  Street, 
and  from  the  west  side  of  Ninth  to  the  Schuylkill  River.  Sta- 
tion, Schuylkill  Eighth  below  Walnut  Street. 

District  No.  4,  extending  from  Chestnut  to  Vine,  and  from 
Ninth  to  the  Schuylkill  River.  Station,  Filbert  Street  near 
Schuylkill  Eighth. 

Each  of  these  divisions  is  under  charge  of  a  high  constable, 
who  reports  daily  at  12  o'clock,  m.,  precisely,  to  the  Mayor, 
the  condition  of  his  district. 

The  Watch  is  likewise  divided  into  four  districts,  the 
bounds  and  stations  of  which  are  the  same  as  those  of  the 
day  police.     Each  of  these  divisions  consists  of  a  captain,  a

lieutenant,  and  fifty  men ;  twenty-five  of  whom  only  are  on 
duty  in  the  division  at  any  one  time.  The  system  is  one  of 
relief,  and  the  twenty-five  men  on  duty  are  relieved  every  two, 
three,  or  four  hours,  as  the  season,  weather,  &amp;c.,  may  demand ; 
the  remaining  twenty-five  occupy  the  station  house,  ready  for 
any  emergency. 

The  system  is  not  perfect,  there  being  too  few  men ;  the 
twenty-five  on  duty  are  spread  over  too  great  a  space.  The 
old  system  gave  thirty-one  or  thirty-two  men  for  the  same 
divisions ;  now  there  are  only  twenty-five, — the  consequence  is 
an  elongation  of  the  watchmen's  walks,  so  that  they  appear 
"  like  angels'  visits,  few  and  far  between." 

In  addition  to  this  force  the  mayor  can,  by  law,  require  the 
services  of  the  lamp-lighters,  in  case  of  necessity,  as  policemen. 

The  Select  Council  consists  of  twelve  members.  The 
Common  Council  of  twenty  members.  These  Councils  are 
divided,  for  the  better  transaction  of  business,  into  joint  stand- 
ing committees,  viz.j  on  Water,  Finance,  Highways,  Cleansing, 
City  Property,  Legacies  and  Trusts,  Girard  Estates,  Library, 
and  Gas-works.  Each  Council  elects  its  own  president  and 
clerk. 

Board  of  City  Commissioners.  The  officers  of  this  Board 
are  a  President,  Clerk,  City  Surveyor,  Assistant  Surveyor, 
Treasurer,  Treasurer  of  the  Girard  Fund,  Agent  for  the  Girard 
Estates,  and  a  Register  and  Secretary  of  the  Watering  Com- 
mittee. 

The  City  and  County  Commissioners  and  Officers 
consist  of  a  Sheriff,  Coroner,  Clerk,  Treasurer,  three  County 
Commissioners,  and  three  Auditors. 

The  Consolidated  Police  Force  of  the  City  of  Phi- 
ladelphia. This  force  is  under  the  control  of  a  Board  of 
Police,  viz.,  President,  John  S.  Keyser,  Marshal  of  Police; 
Clerk,  Samuel  P.  Welsh;  Members,  President  of  the  Select

Council,  and  President  of  the  Common  Council  of  Philadelphia, 
together  with  the  presidents  of  the  Boards  of  Commissioners 
of  the  various  incorporated  districts.  This  police  force  was 
established  by  an  Act  of  Assembly,  passed  May  3d,  1850; 
according  to  which  the  qualified  voters  of  the  city  and  districts 
shall  elect,  every  three  years,  a  suitable  person  as  Marshal  of 
Police,  "  who  shall  hold  that  office  for  the  said  term  of  three 
years,  if  he  so  long  behave  himself  well."  The  powers  of  this 
officer,  in  relation  to  the  preservation  of  the  peace,  the  preven- 
tion and  suppression  of  crimes  and  misdemeanours,  and  the 
detection  and  arrest  of  offenders,  is  the  same  as  those  of  the 
Mayor  of  the  city,  and  Sheriff  of  the  county  of  Philadelphia. 

The  city  proper,  by  the  aforesaid  act,  consists  of  four  divi- 
sions, and  each  of  the  incorporated  districts  constitutes  a 
division.  Each  of  these  divisions  is  entitled  to  one  lieutenant, 
and  the  number  of  policemen  is  fixed  at  the  rate  of  one  for 
every  four  hundred  inhabitants,  which  gives  fifty-five  to  the 
city,  twenty-six  to  Spring  Garden,  twenty-four  to  Kensington, 
twenty-one  to  the  Northern  Liberties,  eighteen  to  Southwark, 
twelve  to  Moyamensing,  four  to  Penn,  four  to  Richmond,  and 
three  to  West  Philadelphia,  which,  with  the  twelve  lieutenants 
and  Marshal,  makes  the  effective  force  of  the  establishment 
one  hundred  and  eighty  strong. 

In  case  of  riot,  if  the  Marshal  is  of  opinion  that  his  force  is 
not  sufficient,  he  has  power  to  require  the  aid  of  the  military, 
and  it  is  the  duty  of  the  major-general  or  commanding  officer 
to  assist  him  promptly  with  such  force  as  he  may  demand. 
The  Marshal,  his  Lieutenants  or  policemen,  in  case  of  emer- 
gency, have  a  right  to,  and  can  demand  the  aid  of  any  citizen 
in  suppressing  riots  or  tumultuous  assemblies.  It  is  well  to 
say  that,  "  if  such  persons,  constituting  unlawful,  riotous,  or 
tumultuous  assemblies,  shall  continue  together,  and  not  dis- 
perse on  proclamation,  then  the  Marshal,  his  Lieutenants,  or

such  persons  as  he  may  command,  shall  use  all  necessary  force

other  persons  aiding  or  assisting  him  in  the  discharge  of  his 
duty,  shall  be  wholly  discharged,  and  held  harmless." 

How  far  this  "Consolidated  Police"  has  accomplished  the 
object  of  its  creation,  can  be  estimated  by  the  fact,  that  from 
the  date  of  its  organization,  November  21st,  1850,  to  Novem- 
ber 1st,  1851,  the  number  of  arrests  by  this  body  amounted  to 
more  than  twelve  thousand.

the  City  or  Districts,  in  the  short  space  of  twenty  minutes  !

THE    BOARD    OF    HEALTH.  375 

The  Board  of  Health,  Office,  southwest  corner  of  Sixth 
and  Sansom  Streets.  This  Board,  consisting  of  eighteen 
members,  is  appointed  annually,  by  the  Councils  of  the  city, 
and  the  Commissioners  of  the  adjoining  districts,  for  a  term  of 
three  years.  The  Governor  of  the  State,  also  appoints  a  Phy- 
sician, who  resides  in  the  city,  denominated  the  Port  Physician, 
and  another,  who  resides  at  the  Lazaretto,  called  the  Lazaretto 
Physician,  together  with  a  Health  Officer,  and  a  Quarantine 
Master. 

The  Board  of  Health  is  vested  "with  full  power  and  au- 
thority to  make  general  rules,  orders,  and  regulations,  for  the 
government  of  the  Lazaretto,  and  the  vessels,  persons,  and 
cargoes,  there  detained  in  quarantine,  likewise  of  the  Health 
Office  and  hospital ;  for  the  mode  of  visiting  and  examining 
vessels,  persons,  goods,  and  houses,  within  the  city  and  districts ; 
also,  to  appoint  such  officers  and  attendants  as  may  be  neces- 
sary to  attend  the  Health  Office,  Lazaretto,  and  City  Hospital, 
together  with  such  other  regulations  as  may  from  time  to 
time  be  requisite  for  the  preservation  of  the  health  of  the 
city." 

This  Board  has  also  power,  when  any  portion  of  the  city,  or 
adjoining  districts,  is  infected  by  a  contagious  disease,  to 
prevent  all  communication  with  the  infected  parts,  and,  if 
necessary,  to  remove  the  inhabitants.  They  have  also  autho- 
rity to  enter  and  search  any  house,  or  store,  where  they  may 
suspect  any  substance  that  may  engender  disease  to  exist,  and 
are  required  to  have  the  same  removed.  A  register  of  the 
births  and  deaths,  in  the  city,  is  kept  at  the  Health  Office,  and 
all  physicians,  surgeons,  &amp;c,  are  required,  by  Act  of  As- 
sembly, to  make  periodical  returns  to  the  Board,  of  the 
deaths,  once  per  week,  and  of  the  births,  once  per  month,  and 
of  all  cases  of  contagious  disease,  under  a  penalty. 

The  quarantine  regulations  of  the  port  commence  in  June,

and  extend  to  October,  which  is  called  the  quarantine  season. 
Vessels  coming  from  foreign  ports,  during  that  period,  must 
anchor  off  the  Lazaretto,  until  duly  inspected  by  the  Lazaretto 
Physician  and  Quarantine  Master.  Severe  penalties  are  im- 
posed by  law,  for  every  violation  of  the  quarantine  regula- 
tions. 

The  following  gentlemen  comprise  the  present  officers  of  the 
Board :  President,  John  Lindsay,  Esq. ;  Secretary,  Richard 
Gardiner,  M.D. ;  Treasurer,  Edward  Duff,  Esq.;  Clerk,  Samuel 
P.  Marks;  Solicitor,  J.  A.  Phillips. 

The  executive  officers  are,  Health  Officer,  William  M'Glen- 
sey;  Port  Physician,  D.  Gilbert,  M.D.;  Lazaretto  Physician, 
T.  J.  P.  Stokes,  M.D. ;  Quarantine  Master,  William  V.  M'Kean. 

The  Lazaretto  is  pleasantly  located  on  the  banks  of  the 
Delaware,  fourteen  miles  below  the  city.  It  occupies  an  area 
of  about  twelve  acres  of  ground,  most  of  which  is  under  cul- 
tivation as  a  vegetable  garden.  The  buildings  consist  of  a 
main  edifice  and  two  wings,  covering  a  space  of  fifty  feet  in 
depth,  and  one  hundred  and  eighty  in  length ;  a  residence, 
with  garden  attached,  for  the  Physician ;  a  similar  one  for  the 
Quarantine  Master;  an  out-kitchen,  a  bath-house,  a  green-house, 
a  large  barn ;  with  a  two-story  building,  originally  intended  for 
the  accommodation  of  German  emigrants,  who,  some  years 
ago,  came  to  this  port  in  very  large  numbers.  It  is  now  used 
for  the  reception  of  those  cases  of  disease  exhibiting  a  more 
malignant  character  than  are  usually  accommodated  at  the 
general  hospital. 

The  officers  are  a  Steward,  Lazaretto  Physician,  and  Quaran- 
tine Master.  The  Steward  is  elected  annually  by  the  Board 
of  Health.  His  duties  comprise  a  general  supervision  of  the 
property,  cultivation  of  the  garden,  furnishing  and  preparing 
the  diet  and  board  of  the  sick,  &amp;c.  The  Physician  and  Qua- 
rantine Master  are   appointed,    as   before   remarked,  by   the

Governor.  The  duties  of  the  first-named  are  to  visit  all  ves- 
sels required  by  law  to  stop  at  the  Lazaretto,  and  to  examine 
into  the  health  of  the  crew  and  passengers,  and  if  any  are  sick 
with  malignant  or  contagious  diseases,  to  have  them  removed 
to  the  hospital,  and  there  attend  them. 

The  duties  of  the  Quarantine  Master  are  to  accompany  the 
Physician  in  his  visits  as  above,  have  charge  of  the  boats  and 
other  property „of  the  station,  and,  jointly  with  the  physician, 
have  control  of  the  bargemen. 

The  Board  has  also,  during  the  quarantine  months,  six 
bargemen  employed,  and  as  many  nurses  as  the  wants  of  the 
station  may  require.  The  duties  of  the  bargemen,  in  addition 
to  manning  the  boats,  are,  to  remove  the  sick,  bury  the  dead, 
and  to  perform  such  other  duties  as  may  be  required  of  them 
by  the  proper  officers. 

Adjoining  the  Lazaretto,  the  United  States  government  has 
an  Inspection  Station,  occupying  about  nine  acres  of  land, 
upon  which  are  a  large  storehouse,  and  two  brick  buildings, 
formerly  occupied  during  the  prevalence  of  the  yellow  fever, — 
one,  as  the  residence  of  the  collector  of  the  port,  and  the  other 
as  a  custom-house. 

State  Penitentiary,  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Pennsyl- 
vania.— This  institution  is  the  result  of  the  laborious  investi- 
gation of  half  a  century,  of  a  few  minds,  deeply  interested  in 
the  subject  of  prison  discipline.  In  the  latter  part  of  the  year 
1786,  the  treatment  of  persons  convicted  of  crimes  engaged 
the  consideration  of  some  members  of  the  "  Philadelphia  So- 
ciety for  Relieving  the  Miseries  of  Public  Prisons."  The 
miserable  condition  of  the  jails  of  that  day  awakened  the  sym- 
pathy of  the  benevolent  members  of  this  Society,  and  out  of 
these  feelings  grew  the  efforts,  which  were  at  last,  under  the 
operation  of  able  minds,  directed  to  the  whole  range  of  penal 
jurisprudence.    The  Legislature  of  Pennsylvania  was  addressed

from  time  to  time  on  the  subject :  the  late  Bishop  White, 
Mr.  Wistar,  Koberts  Vaux,  and  other  kindred  spirits, 
united  their  efforts  to  induce  the  General  Assembly  of  the 
State  to  reform  the  penal  institutions  of  the  Commonwealth. 
After  years  spent  in  examination  and  controversy,  the  Legis- 
lature passed  an  act  authorizing  certain  gentlemen  commis- 
sioners named  in  the  act  to  erect  a  State  Penitentiary  on  the 
principle  of  separate  confinement  of  the  prisoners  at  hard 
labour. 

This  is  the  corner-stone  of  what  is  now  designated  u  The 
Pennsylvania  System." 

Much  has  been  written  on  the  merits  of  "  separate  confine- 
ment." It  has  been  always  denominated  by  its  enemies  soli- 
tar?/  confinement;  but  mere  terms,  though  used  to  describe 
the  character  of  the  discipline,  are  by  no  means  synonymous. 
The  separation  of  prisoners  from  each  other,  at  all  times,  does

not  include  the  idea  of  solitude.  We  have  been  favoured  with 
the  correspondence  between  the  Honourable  Roberts  Vaux 
of  Philadelphia,  and  William  Roscoe  of  England,  on  the 
principles  of  the  Pennsylvania  System.  Mr.  Vaux  defends 
and  explains  the  subject  with  great  clearness  against  the  attack 
of  Mr.  Roscoe,  who  urges  all  the  objections  against  the  System, 
so  rife  while  it  was  then  in  its  infancy. 

The  Penitentiary  was  finished  and  transferred  to  the  "  Board 
of  Inspectors/'  the  governing  power,  in  the  year  1829.  The 
cost  of  the  ground  and  buildings  was  about  six  hundred  thou- 
sand dollars.  In  the  year  1846,  January  1st,  a  period  of  about 
seventeen  years,  2059  prisoners  had  been  received  into  the 
prison.  The  number  now  nearly  reaches  3000.  The  average 
number  in  confinement  during  the  year  is  about  300.  For  the 
last  ten  years  the  average  amount  of  prisoners  yearly  in  the 
Penitentiary  is  about  295.  The  district  from  which  prisoners 
are  sent  includes  all  the  eastern  counties  of  Pennsylvania. 

The  Institution  is  governed  by  a  Board  of  Inspectors,  a  war- 
den, physician,  and  fourteen  overseers.  It  has  been  in  active 
operation  since  1829,  and  the  results  given  by  the  experience 
of  over  twenty  years  have  confirmed  all  the  predictions  and 
expectations  of  its  originators  and  friends. 

The  penal  code  of  the  State  has  not  yet  been  fully  adapted 
to  this  system  of  punishment.  So  soon  as  the  Legislature  shall 
reform  a  code,  never  revised  with  any  degree  of  radical  reform, 
then  will  Pennsylvania  defy  the  civilized  world  to  show  a  more 
perfect,  humane,  and  reformatory  system,  than  is  to  be  found 
within  her  borders. 

The  plan  of  the  buildings  is  as  follows.  The  grounds  com- 
prise about  eleven  acres,  enclosed  by  a  stone  wall,  thirty  feet 
high.  The  centre  of  the  plot  is  comparable  to  the  hub  of  a 
wheel,  and  the  corridors  of  cells,  the  spokes ;  on  each  side  of 
the  corridors,  cells  are  situated,   to  each  of  which  a  yard  is

attached,  for  air  and  exercise.  Each  prisoner  has  a  cell  to 
himself;  there  he  works,  and  sleeps,  and  eats,  taking  exercise 
daily  in  the  yard. 

Each  prisoner  is  taught  to  read,  write,  and  a  useful  handi- 
craft, during  his  term  of  imprisonment.  A  moral  instructor 
and  a  teacher,  are  employed.  On  the  Lord's  day,  any  Chris- 
tian minister,  of  good  standing  in  his  denomination,  can  visit 
the  convicts,  and  preach  to  them,  or  otherwise  instruct  them. 

No  corporeal  punishment  of  prisoners  is  allowed ;  kindness 
is  the  spirit  of  all  communication  with  the  inmates. 

The  health  of  the  convicts  is  under  the  most  judicious  cir- 
cumspection. The  physician  resides  in  the  Penitentiary.  The 
mortality  is  about  two  per  cent,  less  than  one  would  expect, 
from  the  kind  of  persons  sent  from  the  depraved  classes  of  city 
humanity.  The  fatal  diseases  are  nearly  all  constitutional, 
produced  by  causes  mostly  without  the  influence  of  the  prison. 

The  Penitentiary  is  located  about  two  miles  from  the  centre 
of  the  city  of  Philadelphia.  It  is  sometimes  called  u  Cherry 
Hill  Prison,"  as  "  Cherry  Hill"  was  the  name  of  the  property 
purchased  for  its  site. 

At  this  time,  Richard  Yaux  is  President  of  the  Board  of 
Inspectors;  S.  A.  Mercer,  Secretary;  Hon.  Charles  Brown, 
John  Bacon,  and  Hugh  Campbell,  Inspectors ;  John  S. 
Holloway,  Warden ;  Dr.  Lassiter,  Physician. 

Tickets  of  admission  can  be  had  on  application  to  any  of 
the  Inspectors.  For  the  accommodation  of  strangers,  we  will 
state  that  Mr.  Vaux's  offi.ce  is  in  Sixth  below  Chestnut  Street. 
This  gentleman  takes  pleasure  in  giving  any  information  in 
his  power  respecting  this  truly  noble  Institution,  which,  we 
assure  the  reader,  is  well  worthy  of  a  visit. 

There  is  a  prison  in  Pittsburg,  on  the  same  plan,  for  Western

THE     COUNTY    PRISON. 


387 


THE    COUNTY    PEISON. 


Philadelphia  County  Prison,  is  situated  on  Passyunk 
Road,  in  the  District  of  Moyamensing,  about  one  mile  south  of 
the  city  proper.  There  is  a  line  of  omnibuses  constantly 
running  from  the  Exchange,  via  Chestnut  and  Ninth  Streets, 
to  within  half  a  square  of  the  prison. 

The  front  of  this  structure  consists  of  a  centre  building, 
with  receding  wings  on  either  side,  flanked  by  massy  octa- 
gonal towers;  beyond  these  towers  receding  wing- walls  are 
continued  to  the  extremities  of  the  front,  and  terminate  with 
embattled  bastions.  The  whole  exterior  is  constructed  of 
Quincy  granite,  and  the  style  of  architecture,  that  of  the  olden 
days  of  chivalry,  decorated  in  the  Tudor  style  of  English 
Gothic. 

The  wings  are  two  stories  high,  and  contain  the  gates  of

entrance.  These  wings  and  the  towers  which  flank  them, 
together  with  the  bastions  on  the  extreme  angles  in  front,  are 
finished  to  correspond  with  the  centre  edifice.  The  extreme 
height  of  the  centre  building  is  seventy -five  feet. 

The  interior  of  the  main  prison  is  divided  into  two  general 
divisions,  one  for  untried  prisoners,  vagrants,  &amp;c,  and  the 
other  for  convicts.  It  contains  four  hundred  and  eight  sepa- 
rate cells,  built  in  two  blocks,  three  stories  high,  extending 
from  each  wing  at  right  angles  with  the  principal  front.  The 
cells  open  into  a  corridor,  occupying  the  centre  of  each  block, 
and  extending  the  whole  length  and  height  of  the  building  ; 
the  upper  stories  being  approached  by  means  of  granite  stair- 
ways leading  to  galleries,  supported  by  cast  iron  brackets ;  a 
clerk's  office  is  situated  at  the  head  of  each  corridor,  from 
which  every  cell  door  may  be  seen  throughout  the  entire  range. 

The  apartment  for  females  is  situated  on  an  adjoining  lot. 
This  building  embraces  one  hundred  separate  cells,  a  suite  of 
rooms  for  an  infirmary,  and  two  apartments  for  the  keepers. 
The  principal  entrance  to  this  portion  of  the  establishment 
is  on  Eleventh  Street :  it  consists  of  a  gateway,  placed  in  the 
middle  of  a  projecting  centre,  constructed  of  brown  stone, 
finished  in  the  Egyptian  style  of  architecture. 

The  Prison  combines  all  the  characteristics  of  a  penitentiary 
proper,  as  well  as  those  of  a  county  jail  and  workhouse.  It  is 
under  the  management  of  a  Board  of  fifteen  Inspectors,  whose 
duties  are  probably  more  arduous  than  those  of  any  other  in 
the  country,  yet  we  have  no  hesitation  to  speak  with  confidence 
of  the  generally  correct  regulation  and  superintendence  of  every 
department. 

The  health  of  the  Prison  is  good.  In  this  respect  it  will 
compare  favourably  with  any  other  in  the  United  States. 
Great  care  is  taken  to  furnish  wholesome  food,  and  to  have  it 
properly   cooked ;   every   prisoner   is   allowed  as   much  as  he

wants,  this  being  found  more    economical  than  the  mode   of 
individual  rations. 

We  refer  with  pleasure  to  the  moral  instruction  of  the  pri- 
soners. The  Rev.  W.  Alexander  fills  the  office  of  Instructor, 
with  both  credit  to  himself,  and  satisfaction  to  the  Inspectors. 

The  female  department  is  regularly  attended  by  a  committee 
of  four  ladies,  belonging  to  the  "  Association  of  Women 
Friends."  The  Inspectors  and  others  acquainted  with  the 
labours  of  this  Society,  speak  highly  of  the  wholesome  effects 
resulting  from  their  efforts.  Indeed,  there  is  nothing  connected 
with  the  internal  regulations  of  the  prison,  that  presents  a 
more  pleasing  and  interesting  spectacle  than  the  untiring  energy 
and  laudable  zeal  of  these  truly  benevolent  ladies. 

Each  convict,  on  leaving  the  prison  at  the  expiration  of  his 
sentence,  is  furnished  with  a  suit  of  decent  clothes,  and  a  sum 
of  money  for  his  present  wants,  as  the  means  of  removing  him 
from  the  immediate  temptation  to  commit  crime. 

The  officers  of  the  Prison  consist  of  a  superintendent,  a 
clerk,  a  matron,  two  deputies,  a  physician,  and  a  moral  in- 
structor. 

Tickets  of  admission  can  be  obtained,  by  applying  to  Dr. 
Burden,  President  of  the  Board  of  Inspectors,  Philadelphia 
College,  Fifth  below  Walnut  Street,  or  from  Dr.  Bunting, 
Register  of  Wills'  office,  State  House  Bow. 

THE   FIRE   DEPARTMENT. 

In  the  year  1711,  the  then  Mayor  of  Philadelphia  recom- 
mended "  the  procuring  of  fire-buckets,  hooks,  ladders,  and 
fire-engines,  for  the  purpose  of  aiding  in  extinguishing  fires." 
"  This,"  says  Watson,  "  was  a  pretty  early  beginning )  as  fire- 
engines  were  but  of  recent  invention,  and  had  only  been  in  use 
in  London  since  1663."  Notwithstanding  this  recommenda- 
tion, no  active  measures  were  taken  in  the  matter  until  the

THE    FIRE    DEPARTMENT.  395 

year  1730,  when  public  attention  was  awakened  to  the  impor- 
tance of  the  subject,  by  a  destructive  fire,  which  consumed 
several  houses  in  Front  below  Walnut  Street.  Soon  after  this 
event,  several  hundred  buckets  and  two  fire-engines  were  im- 
ported from  England.  The  buckets  were  placed  in  the  court- 
house, that  formerly  stood  in  Market  Street,  and  the  engines  were 
stationed,  one  at  the  southwest  corner  of  Market  and  Second 
Streets,  the  other  at  the  corner  of  Walnut  and  Front  Streets. 
In  the  year  1738,  Benjamin  Franklin,  among  other  patriotic 
exertions  in  behalf  of  his  adopted  city,  succeeded  in  originating 
the  First  Fire  Company. 

At  present  there  are  seventy  of  these  praiseworthy  associa- 
tions in  the  city  of  Philadelphia  and  adjoining  districts,  viz., 
thirty-five  engines,  thirty-three  hose,  and  two  hook  and  ladder 
companies. 

A  highly  commendable  spirit  animates  their  members.  They 
are  ever  prompt  at  the  scene  of  danger,  regardless  alike  of 
time,  distance,  or  weather.  Actions  of  truly  disinterested 
heroism  and  intrepidity  are  of  almost  daily  occurrence  among 
these  young  men ;  and  the  department  has,  on  more  than  one 
occasion  within  a  few  years,  been  called  upon  to  mourn  the 
loss  of  valuable  lives,  sacrificed  in  the  discharge  of  this  self- 
imposed  though  patriotic  duty. 

The  introduction  of  the  Schuylkill  water  into  the.  city, 
proved  very  efficient  in  the  preservation  of  property  from 
destruction  by  fire.  Previous  to  that,  water  was  obtained  in 
small  quantities,  and  with  considerable  trouble,  from  the  pumps, 
which  in  most  places  were  few  and  far  between.  In  the  year 
1803,  Mr.  Reuben  Haines  suggested  the  idea  of  attaching  a 
hose  to  the  different  fire-plugs,  by  means  of  which  the  engines 
might  be  the  more  readily  supplied  with  water.  The  improve- 
ment received  the  approbation  of  several  of  his  friends,  who  that 
year  organized  themselves  into  a  fire  company,  assuming  shortly 
afterwards  the  title  of  "The  Philadelphia  Hose  Company."

THE    FIRE    DEPARTMENT.  397 

Another  efficient  means  of  preserving  the  city  from  the  dan- 
ger of  widespread  conflagration,  was  the  law  of  1796,  prohibit- 
ing the  erection  of  wooden  buildings  within  the  city.  This 
excellent  act  has  subsequently  been  extended,  so  that  at  present 
it  embraces  all  the  city  proper,  and  a  great  portion  of  the 
adjoining  districts. 

This  department  has  an  Association  for  the  Relief  of 
Disabled  Firemen,  established  and  incorporated  in  1835. 
The  object  of  this  praiseworthy  society  is  not  only  the  relief 
of  disabled  firemen,  but  also  of  their  widows  and  orphans,  and 
the  relief  of  such  persons,  not  firemen,  who  may  sustain  per- 
sonal injury  by  fire  apparatus.  The  funds  of  the  Association, 
which  at  present  amount  to  about  $17,500,  are  permanently 
invested,  principally  in  ground  rents,  mortgages,  &amp;c,  the  in- 
terest from  which  can  be  appropriated  to  no  other  object  than 
that  for  which  the  Association  was  instituted.  The  total 
amount  distributed  for  this  purpose  since  the  institution  of  the 
Association  has  been  nearly  $9,000.  No  benevolent  society 
in  our  city  has  stronger  claims  than  this. 

Each  fire  company  usually  consists  of  about  thirty  active 
members,  composed  for  the  most  part  of  young  men  engaged 
in  the  active  pursuits  of  life.  Great  care  is  taken,  and  much 
pride  manifested  in  having  their  apparatus  constructed  after  the 
most  improved  models,  and  built  in  the  most  substantial 
manner.  They  are  also  beautifully,  and  for  the  most  part, 
richly  ornamented. 

The  following  list  embraces  all  the  companies  comprising  the 
department. 

engine  companies.

INTERNAL    IMPROVEMENTS.  405 


CHAPTER  XL 

INTERNAL   IMPROVEMENTS. 

Perhaps  in  no  particular  has  society  changed  to  a  greater 
extent,  within  the  last  fifty  years,  than  in  the  mode  and  rapidity 
of  travelling.  In  those  days,  a  journey  to  New  York  or 
Baltimore,  or  even  to  Trenton,  was  both  a  long  and  tedious 
one,  accomplished,  for  the  most  part,  on  horseback,  or  in 
wagons.  In  1775,  six  weeks  were  occupied  in  going  to  and 
returning  from  Boston ;  and  at  a  still  later  period,  it  took  ten 
or  twelve  days  to  make  the  journey  to  New  York,  a  distanoe 
now  accomplished  in  four  and  a  half  hours.  Then  the  post- 
carrier  was  the  most  important  personage  in  the  community ; 
his  arrival,  announced  by  his  well-known  horn,  was  the  cause 
of  a  much  greater  sensation  in  the  community  than  that  now 
excited  by  "  the  latest  news  from  Europe." 

The  first  improvement  towards  facilitating  the  communica- 
tion between  distant  parts  of  the  country,  was  the  construction 
of  turnpike  roads.  This  subject  early  attracted  the  attention 
of  the  public  in  this  State,  particularly  of  the  city  of  Phila- 
delphia. In  1791,  the  Lancaster  Turnpike  Company  was  in- 
corporated, and  the  road  opened  to  travel  in  1795.  In  1804, 
the  Grerinantown  and  Perkiomen  Turnpike-road  Company  was 
chartered,  and  the  road  completed  two  years  afterwards.  The 
advantages  of  these  enterprises,  being  the  first  of  the  kind  in 
the  United  States,  soon  led  to  the  establishment  of  others.  At 
present  there  are  no  less  than  one  hundred  and  seventy  of  these 
companies  in  Pennsylvania,  having  together  over  four  thousand 
miles  of  turnpike  road.

INTERNAL    IMPROVEMENTS.  407 

We  learn  from  good  authority,  that,  from  the  establishment 
of  the  first-named  of  these  corporations,  to  the  year  1824,  the 
enormous  sum  of  $22,000,000  was  expended  in  this  State  on 
turnpikes,  bridges,  canals,  and  railroads.  Thus,  strange  as  it 
may  appear  to  the  general  reader,  Pennsylvania  took,  if  not 
the  first,  an  early  and  an  active  part  in  introducing  that  splendid 
system  of  internal  improvement  now  so  characteristic  of  the 
United  States. 

Before  any  of  her  sister  States  appreciated  their  importance, 
Pennsylvania  had  adopted  an  harmonious  chain  of  canals  and 
railroads,  which,  when  fully  completed,  will  intersect  every 
part  of  the  State,  leaving  no  point  at  a  greater  distance  from 
those  great  highways  than,  at  most,  thirty  miles.  If  she  failed 
at  an  earlier  day  in  accomplishing  so  desirable  an  object,  it 
was  not  for  want  of  the  spirit  of  enterprise,  but  rather,  that 
she  was  too  much  in  advance  of  the  age.  If  for  a  time  sus- 
pended, these  improvements  were  not  abandoned.  Our  citizens 
have  again  entered  the  field  with  renewed  and  determined 
energy. 

The  great  Central  or  Pennsylvania  Railroad,  which  is  to 
bind  this  city  to  the  fertile  Valley  of  the  Mississippi,  and  to 
open  untold  avenues  of  trade  to  our  merchants  and  tradesmen, 
is  now  rapidly  progressing  towards  completion.  Nor  is  this 
work,  vast  though  it  be,  all  that  now  engrosses  the  attention 
of  the  citizens  of  Pennsylvania.  Companies  have  been  char- 
tered, and  means  are  being  procured  to  complete  those  lines 
projected  to  reach  the  Lakes,  the  trade  of  which  already  ex- 
ceeds in  value  the  whole  foreign  commerce  of  the  Union. 

The  Columbia  and  Pennsylvania  Railroad. — Depot, 
Market,  west  of  Broad  Street ;  Directors'  Office,  Walnut,  west

RAILROADS.  409 

Huntingdon,  Hollidaysburg,  and  Pittsburg,  to  Beaver ;  thence 
through  Salem,  Masillon,  Wooster,  Mansfield,  Columbus, 
Springfield,  Dayton,  to  Cincinnati.  A  branch  intersects  this 
road  at  Salem,  leading  to  Cleveland;  another  at  Bellefonte, 
which  will  run  through  Indianapolis  to  Terre  Haute  in  In- 
diana. This  branch  it  is  contemplated  to  carry  through  the 
State  of  Illinois  to  St.  Louis,  thence  to  Independence,  where 
it  will  unite  with  the  great  Oregon  route.  The  importance  of 
this  great  Central  or  Pennsylvania  Railroad  to  the  prosperity 
of  Philadelphia,  cannot  be  too  highly  appreciated  by  her 
citizens. 

Philadelphia,  Reading,  and  Pottsville  Railroad. — 
Depots,  corner  of  Vine  and  Broad  Streets,  and  corner  of  Cherry 
and  Broad  Streets.  Directors'  Office,  Fourth  below  Walnut 
Street.  This  road  commences  at  Broad  and  Vine  Streets, 
thence  on  the  east  side  of  the  river  Schuylkill  to  the  Columbia 
Bridge,  where  it  crosses  to  the  west  side,  thence  following  the 
river  to  Reading,  Pottsville,  Sunbury,  Northumberland,  and 
Williamsport. 

This  road  is  one  of  the  most  valuable  in  the  State,  running 

as  it  does  through  the  richest  coal  region  in  Pennsylvania.     It 

has,  by  its  extensive  means  of  transit,  contributed  to  make  our 

city  the  coal  market  of  the  Atlantic  States.     It  is  contemplated 

to  extend  a  branch,  one  of  great  importance,  too,  from  this 

road  at  Pottsville,  to  Elmira,  where  it  will  intersect  the  New 

York  and  Erie  Railroad.     "When  this  project  is  carried  out  it 

will  materially  benefit  the  trade  of  Philadelphia,  by  securing, 

not  only  the  custom  and  travel  of  the  northern  counties  of 

Pennsylvania,  but,  to  a  great  extent,  that  also  of  Western  New 

York,  Canada,  and  the  Northwestern  States.     A  branch  leaves 

this  road  at  the  Schuylkill  Falls,  and  crosses  by  a  beautiful 

viaduct  to  the  east  bank,  thence  pursues  an  eastern  course  to 

Port  Richmond.

Northern  Liberties  and  Spring  Garden,  or  Willow 
Street  Railroad,  leaves  the  Reading  Railroad  at  Broad 
Street,  and  runs  down  Willow  Street  to  the  Delaware  River. 
A  branch  up  Ninth  Street  connects  this  road  to  the  Norristown 
Railroad. 

Steamboats  leave  Philadelphia  daily  for  New  York,  Balti- 
more, Trenton,  Wilmington,  Salem,  Chester,  Newcastle,  Bridge- 
ton,  Burlington,  and  Bristol.  A  line  also  runs,  during  the 
bathing  season,  to  Cape  May.  Nor  must  we  forget  the  popu- 
lar line  of  steamboats  plying  on  the  romantic  Schuylkill ;  from 
Fairmount  to  the  Columbia  Bridge,  Laurel  Hill,  and  Mana- 
yunk. 

Ferry-boats  run  every  half  hour  to  Gloucester  and  Red 
Bank,  and  every  hour  to  Port  Richmond,  Bridesburg,  and 
Tacony.  Those  to  Camden  run  every  five  minutes.  None  of

Bridges. — There  are  eight  Bridges  in  the  vicinity  of  Phila- 
delphia. 

The  Philadelphia,  Wilmington,  and  Baltimore  Rail- 
road Bridge,  at  Gray's  Ferry.  This  is  a  drawbridge ;  one 
side  of  it  is  appropriated  to  carriages  and  foot  passengers.  It 
has  lately  been  strengthened  by  the  erection  of  new  arches,  to 
allow  the  passage  of  locomotives,  which  the  Company  design  to 
run  to  their  new  depot  at  Broad  and  Prime  Streets. 

The  Market  Street  Railroad  Bridge,  formerly  The 
Permanent  Bridge,  was  altered  in  1850,  so  as  to  allow  the 
City  Railroad  to  form  a  connexion  with  the  Columbia  and  Penn- 
sylvania Railroad.  The  structure  is  supported  by  two  massive 
stone  piers,  and  two  abutments,  with  wing-walls.  The  western 
pier  was  sunk,  at  a  great  expense,  to  the  depth  of  forty  feet 
below  mean  tide.  Over  seven  thousand  five  hundred  tons  of 
stone  were  used  in  its  construction.      The  railway  occupies  the

north  side,  the  south  side  being  appropriated  to  carriages. 
Outside  of  each  way,  are  accommodations  for  foot  passengers, 
protected  by  substantial  railings.     It  is  free  of  toll. 

The  Fairmount  Bridge. — The  first  bridge  erected  on  this 
site  was  a  beautiful  and  unique  structure.  It  consisted  of  a 
single  arch,  of  three  hundred  and  forty  feet  span,  resting  on 
abutments  of  stone.  This  span  was  said  to  have  been  at  least 
ninety  feet  longer  than  that  of  any  other  bridge  in  the  world. 
After  its  destruction  by  fire,  the  present  elegant  suspension 
bridge  was  erected  by  the  county,  in  1841,  at  a  cost  of  $55,000. 
It  is  much  admired  for  its  beauty  and  simplicity,  as  well  as  the 
ingenuity  of  its  construction. 

The  additional  bridges  are,  The  Columbia  Bridge,  The 
Richmond  Bailroad  Bridge,  at  the  Schuylkill  Falls ;  one 
at  Manayunk,  one  at  Flat  Bock,  above  Manayunk,  and  the 
Norristown  Bailroad  Bridge,  over  the  Wissahiccon  River.

THE     GIRARD     HOUSE. 


The  Girard  House,  Chestnut  Street,  between  Eighth  and 
Ninth  Streets,  exceeds,  in  its  architectural  character  and  ar- 
rangements, any  similar  establishment  in  Philadelphia,  and 
is  one  of  the  largest  and  most  magnificent  hotels  in  the  United 
States.  The  interior  is  particularly  deserving  of  attention, 
being,  not  only  a  model,  in  point  of  convenience  of  arrangement, 
but  ornamented  in  most  excellent  taste,  and  finished  and  fur- 
nished in  a  degree  of  splendour  rarely  excelled. 

The  architect,  John  M' Arthur,  Esq.,  has  happily  combined 
elegance  with  the  richest  decoration  throughout  the  whole 
building.  The  accommodations  are  also  in  keeping  with  the 
architectural  character  of  the  house.  These,  with  the  advan- 
tages of  its  location,  will  no  doubt,  render  "  The  Girard"  a  dis- 
tinguished and  fashionable  resort.

hotel,  having  accommodations  for  over  two  hundred  and  fifty 
inmates.  Congress  Hall,  on  Third  above  Chestnut  Street,  is 
part  of  the  same  establishment. 

In  addition  to  these,  there  are  The  Union  Hotel  (a  new 
establishment),  Arch  west  of  Third  Street;  The  Eagle  Hotel, 
Third  above  Race  Street;  The  City  Hotel,  Third  below  Arch 
Street ;  The  Red  Lion  Hotel,  Market  above  Sixth  Street ;  The 
Mansion  House,  Market  and  Eleventh  Street ;  The  Madison 
House,  Second  below  Arch  Street;  The  Mount  Vernon 
House,  Second  above  Arch  Street ;  The  White  Swan,  Race 
above  Third  Street;  Bloodgood's  Hotel,  South  Wharves; 
Ridg way's  Hotel,  Market  and  North  Wharves;  Jones's 
Hotel,  Dock  below  Third  Street;  Bull's  Head  Hotel, 
Sixth  above  Callowhill  Street,  with  many  others ; — all  extensive 
stablishments,  affording  every  comfort  and  accommodation  toe 
their  inmates,  that  can  possibly  be  desired, — so  that  the  traveller 
need  not  fear  making  a  bad  selection.

traveller,  looking  back  through  the  scenes  which  he  has  passed, 
we  view  with  regret,  many  places  of  interest  previously  dis- 
regarded, which  now  rise  before  us,  when  the  power  to  enjoy 
them  can  never  return. 

Old  buildings,  ruins,  or  places  rendered  memorable  by  scenes 
of  patriotism,  or  as  being  the  homes  of  genius  or  virtue,  have 
ever  been  held  in  veneration  by  the  people  of  all  ages  and  na- 
tions. With  what  emotions  do  we  view  the  battle-fields  of 
the  Revolution  ?  With  what  admiration  do  we  tread  "  those 
halls"  consecrated  to  undying  fame,  by  the  eloquence  and 
wisdom  of  a  Washington,  Adams,  Franklin,  Jefferson,  Henry, 
and  hosts  of  others,  whose  words  and  deeds  elevate  the  name 
of  America  ?  To  us,  these  places  and  scenes  awake,  not  one 
idea  only,  but  a  long  line  of  glowing  thoughts,  which,  by  their 
pleasing  associations,  produce  to  the  mind  infinite  delight. 

Among  the  few  memorials  of  olden  days  still  remaining  in 
this  city,  is 

The  Penn  Cottage,  situated  in  Lastitia  Court,  Market 
Street  between  Front  and  Second  Streets.  It  is  memorable  as 
being  one  of  the  first,  if  not  the  first  brick  building  erected  in 
Philadelphia,  and  also  as  being  the  residence  of  William  Penn, 
during  his  first  visit  to  this  country,  in  1682—83. 

The  area  originally  attached  to  the  property,  extended  from 
Front  to  Second  Street,  and  from  Market  Street  south  to  the 
present  Black  Horse  Alley.  The  space  to  Front  Street  was 
laid  out  as  a  lawn,  and  was  shaded  by  a  luxuriant  growth  of 
forest  trees,  interspersed  with  shrubbery.  On  the  Second 
Street  side  was  the  garden,  containing  many  choice  and  rare 
fruit  trees.  The  principal  entrance  to  "  The  Mansion,"  was 
by  an  avenue  leading  to  Second  Street ;  another  extended  down 
the  present  court  to  Market  Street.  The  first-named  is  now 
occupied,  for  the  most  part,  by  Harris's  Court, — a  filthy,  ill- 
ventilated  place,  principally  tenanted  by  poor  families.

THE     PENS     COTTAGE. 


The  building,  of  which  our  illustration  is  a  correct  view,  as 
it  existed  in  better  da}'S,  is  at  present  very  much  dilapidated, 
and  falling  rapidly  into  ruin. 

The  Slate-Roof  House,  another  interesting  relic,  derives 
its  name  from  the  fact,  that  for  several  years  after  its  erection 
it  was  the  only  building  covered  with  that  material  in  Phila- 
delphia. The  year  of  its  erection  is  uncertain ;  however,  it  was 
prior  to  1700,  for  we  find  William  Penn  and  his  family  occu- 
pying it,  during  his  second  visit,  in  that  year.  In  it  John  Penn, 
"  the  American,"  was  born.

house.  Within  its  walls,  General  Forbes,  second  in  command 
and  eventually  successor  to  the  unfortunate  General  Braddock, 
breathed  his  last,  and  from  it  he  was  borne  to  his  long  home,  with 
imposing  military  honours.  At  a  later  period,  it  was  the  tem- 
porary abode  of  John  Adams,  John  Hancock,  and  many  other 
distinguished  members  of  the  first  Congress,  and  also  of  Baron 
De  Kalb,  who  fell  in  the  cause  of  American  Independence,  at 
the  battle  of  Camden.  In  it,  too,  the  brave  but  eccentric  Ge- 
neral Lee  died.  His  remains  were  interred  in  Christ  Church 
yard,  alongside  of  the  present  Church  Alley.

story  being  occupied  as  a  huckster's  shop,  and  those  in  the 
rear  as  a  saw  manufactory,  while  the  upper  stories  are  used  by 
a  cabinet-maker  as  a  varnish-room. 

From  its  location,  corner  of  Norris's  Alley  and  Second  Street, 
unless  preserved  by  some  public-spirited  individuals,  this  old 
memorial  will  soon  be  among  the  things  that  were. 

The  Old  London  Coffee-House,  southwest  corner  of 
Front  and  Market  Streets.  This  building  was  erected  in  1702, 
and  occupied  as  a  public  house  in  1754.  For  many  years 
it  was  the  most  noted  place  of  resort  for  strangers,  as  well  as 
citizens,  in  Philadelphia.  Here  were  held  all  auctions  of  horses, 
carriages,  produce,  &amp;c. ;  and  here,  strange  as  it  may  now  appear 
to  citizens  of  the  present  time,  negro  men,  women,  and  children, 
were  bought  and  sold  as  slaves. 

The  premises  are  now  occupied,  the  lower  story  as  a  tobacco 
store,  and  the  upper  as  a  barber's  shop. 

Loxley  House,  situated  on  the  corner  of  Little  Dock  and 
Second  Street,  derives  its  name  from  its  first  proprietor,  who  is 
celebrated  by  Mr.  Graydon  in  his  "  Memoirs  "  (an  excellent 
book  of  the  olden  time,  an  edition  of  which  has  lately  been 
issued  by  Lindsay  &amp;  Blakiston),  as  a  military  chieftain  of  fame 
during  the  "  Paxton  War"  excitement. 

It  derives  its  principal  interest,  however,  from  having  been 
the  residence,  during  the  Kevolution,  of  Lydia  Darrah,  the 
story  of  whose  patriotism  and  devotion  in  conveying  to  General 
Washington  timely  information  of  the  secret  attack  which  the 
British  meditated  upon  the  American  lines,  near  Germantown, 
is  known  to  every  school-boy  throughout  the  country. 

The  building  is  at  present  occupied  as  a  clothing  depot. 

Carpenters'  Hall. — This  edifice  is  situated  in  Carpenters' 
Court,  running  south  from  Chestnut  below  Fourth  Street.  This 
celebrated  building  will  ever  be  cherished  by  the  friends  of 
American  Independence.     Within  its  walls,  the  first  Congress

of  the  United  Colonies  of  North  America  assembled, — a  Con- 
gress whose  fame  is  the  watchword  of  nations — a  Congress  of 
men  who  loved  Liberty  for  Truth's  sake — thoroughly  indepen- 
dent, characterized  by  that  self-denial  which  disdains  the  false 
and  transient  reputation  of  the  day.  Their  wisdom  and  elo- 
quence, as  legislators,  their  skill,  heroism,  and  judgment  on 
the  battle-field,  and  their  devotion  to  the  sacred  cause  of  their 
country's  independence,  as  men,  have  never  been  excelled, 
either  in  ancient  or  modern  days.  Is  it  surprising,  then,  thai 
this  Hall,  the  witness  of  that  "Union"  which  constitutes  the 
glory  of  the  present  age,  is  held  dear  to  all  friends  of  rational 
Freedom  ? 

The  building  is  of  brick,  two  stories  high,  surmounted  by  a 
cupola.    The  fe§adeis  in  the  Roman  style  of  architecture.    The

principal  entrance  leads  to  the  Assembly  Room,  in  which  Con- 
gress first  met.  It  is  now  occupied  as  an  auction  mart.  In 
the  second  story,  the  various  committees  had  their  apartments ; 
they  are  at  present  used  for  the  storage  of  furniture,  &amp;c. 

Carpenters'  Hall  was  originally  erected  by  the  Association  of 
House  Carpenters.  It  is,  we  believe,  still  their  property; 
though  seldom  used  for  the  purpose  for  which  it  was  intended, 
viz.,  the  meetings  of  the  Society. 

The  Indian  Queen  Hotel,  Fourth  Street  between  Market 
and  Chestnut,  was  once  renowned  as  "  the  hotel"  of  Philadel- 
phia. Here,  for  some  time  during  the  Revolution,  Thomas 
Jefferson  resided.  His  chamber  was  the  southwest  "room  in 
the  second  story.  It  was  long  supposed  that  he  wrote  the 
Declaration  of  Independence  in  this  apartment.  This  interesting 
fact,  however,  was  settled  by  the  late  Dr.  Mease,  to  whom  Mr. 
Jefferson  stated,  on  inquiry,  that  when  he  wrote  that  instru- 
ment he  resided  in 

Hultsheimer's  New  House,  at  the  southwest  corner  of 
Seventh  and  Market  Streets.  This  building,  sacred  from  this 
fact,  is  now  occupied,  the  lower  story  as  a  clothing  depot,  and 
the  upper  by  a  printing  office  and  meeting  rooms  for  the 
United  Order  of  American  Mechanics.  The  very  chamber 
occupied  by  Mr.  Jefferson  is  now  the  office  of  the  secretary  of 
that  association. 

In  addition  to  the  above  few  relics,  the  reader  will  find  many 
others,  together  with  much  valuable  information  respecting 
the  early  settlement  and  history  of  the  city,  in  "The  Annals 
of  Philadelphia/'  by  J.  F.  Watson.  To  those  who  love  to 
dwell  upon  "  old-time  recollections,"  and  to  trace  the  progress 
of  our  beautiful  city,  this  book  cannot  be  too  highly  recom- 
mended. Mr.  A.  Hart,  publisher,  Philadelphia,  has  lately 
issued  a  handsome  edition  of  this  valuable  work,  in  two  octavo 

volumes.

THE    FARQUHAR     BUILDING. 


Farquhar  Building,  Walnut  below  Third  Street. — This 
elegant  structure,  erected  by  the  gentleman  whose  name  it  bears, 
forms  a  prominent  object  of  attraction  in  the  vicinity  of  its 
location.  The  building  extends  to  Pear  Street,  and  is  four  stories 
high ;  the  front  is  of  brown  stone,  constructed  in  the  Italian 
style  of  architecture.  Its  proportions  and  decorations  have 
been  much  and  deservedly  admired,  especially  so,  when  con- 
trasted with  some  of  the  productions  of  bad  taste,  with  which 
our  city,  within  the  last  few  years,  has  been  disgraced; — this 
remark  applies  particularly  to  private  edifices.  In  our  edition 
for  1853,  we  propose  appropriating  a  portion  of  the  work  to 
private  buildings,  mansions,  &amp;c,  noticing,  however,  only  those

worthy  of  public  attention  for  their  beauty,  novelty,  conve- 
nience, or  substantial  construction. 

The  Farquhar  Building  is  occupied  by  various  insurance 
companies,  agencies,  brokers,  &amp;c,  for  which  purpose  it  is  well 
adapted,  no  less  from  its  situation  than  convenience  of  internal 
arrangement.  Among  its  numerous  offices  is  that  of  Mr.  Far- 
quhar, its  enterprising  proprietor,  and  also  that  of  J.  Gr.  Hol- 
broke,  Esq.,  Fire,  Life,  and  Marine  Insurance  Agent. 


In  conclusion,  we  assure  our  readers  that  no  exertion  has 
been  wanting  on  our  part,  to  render  the  present  edition  perfect 
and  correct;  but  the  multiplicity  of  objects  which  the  work 
embraces,  renders  it  impossible  to  prevent  some  errors  or 
omissions.  Corrections  and  suggestions  of  every  kind  that  may 
tend  to  enhance  the  value  of  the  work,  particularly  notices  of 
improvements,  new  institutions,  and  associations,  together  with 
the  annual  reports  of  the  various  benevolent,  literary,  scientific 
religious,  and  other  societies,  are  earnestly  solicited. 

The  encouragement  bestowed  upon  our  efforts  in  the  present 
volume,  inspires  us  with  renewed  energy  and  determination  to 
to  render  the  succeeding  edition  equally  worthy  of
