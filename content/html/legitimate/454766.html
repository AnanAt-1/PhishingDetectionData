The Tito-era doctrine of "General People's Defence", in which each republic maintained a Territorial Defence Force&nbsp;(<i>Teritorialna obramba</i> or TO), was to be replaced by a centrally directed system of defence. The republics would lose their role in defence matters, and their TOs would be disarmed and subordinated to JNA headquarters in Belgrade.<br />
<br />
The Slovenian government resisted these moves, and successfully ensured that the majority of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("87530",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("87530")' href="/topics/Slovenian_Territorial_Defence">Slovenian Territorial Defence</a><span class="hp" id="m87530"><div class="hpHeader">Slovenian Territorial Defence</div><div class="hpContent">The Territorial Defence of the Republic of Slovenia, also the Territorial Defence of Slovenia  was the predecessor of the Slovenian Armed Forces.- History :...</div><br></span>&nbsp;equipment was kept out of the hands of the JNA. It also declared in a constitutional amendment passed on 28 September 1990 that its TO would be under the sole command of the Slovenian government. At the same time, the Slovenian government set up a secret alternative command structure, known as the Manoeuvre Structures of National Protection (<i>Manevrska struktura narodne zaščite</i>, or MSNZ). This was an existing but antiquated institution, unique to Slovenia, which was intended to enable the republic to form an <i>ad hoc</i> defence structure, akin to a <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("36902",this,"militia.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("36902")' href="/topics/Militia">Home Guard</a><span class="hp" id="m36902"><div class="hpHeader">Militia</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i36902"></div>The term militia  is commonly used today to refer to a military force composed of ordinary citizens to provide defense, emergency law enforcement, or paramilitary service, in times of emergency without being paid a regular salary or committed to a fixed term of service.

However, the DEMOS-led government realised that the MSNZ could be adapted to provide a parallel organisation to the TO that would be entirely in the hands of the Slovenian government.<br />
<br />
When the JNA tried to take control of the Slovenian Territorial Defence (TO), the TO's command structure was simply replaced by that of the parallel MSNZ. Between May and October 1990, some 21,000 Slovenian Territorial Defence and police personnel were secretly mobilised into the MSNZ command structure, of which the federal government was wholly unaware. The Slovenian government also undertook detailed planning of a military campaign against the JNA, which resulted in the production of an operational and tactical plan by November 1990 — over seven months before the conflict actually began.<br />
<br />
The Slovenes were aware that they would not be able to deter the JNA forces for an extended period of time.

Tank columns could be trapped by destroying the lead and rear vehicles in favourable terrain — for instance, on a narrow mountain road where room for manoeuvre was limited &ndash; enabling the rest to be tackled more easily. In preparation for this, the Slovenian government covertly bought lightweight missile systems from foreign suppliers, notably the SA-7 Grail&nbsp;(Strela) anti-aircraft missile and the German-designed <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("55932",this,"armbrust.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("55932")' href="/topics/Armbrust">Armbrust</a><span class="hp" id="m55932"><div class="hpHeader">Armbrust</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i55932"></div>Armbrust  is a lightweight unguided anti-tank weapon designed and developed by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm of Germany, who later sold its manufacturing rights to Chartered Industries of Singapore ....</div><br></span>&nbsp;anti-tank system. Hit-and-run and delaying tactics were to be preferred and frontal clashes were to be avoided since in such situations the JNA's superior firepower would have been very difficult to overcome.<br />
<br />
On the diplomatic front, neither the European Community nor the United States were willing to recognise the independence of Slovenia and strongly advocated the continuation of a unified Yugoslavia. The Slovenian government sought international assistance in negotiating a peaceful breakup of Yugoslavia but was rebuffed by Western countries that said they preferred to deal with a single federation rather than numerous small states. However, the Slovenes contended that they had no choice in pushing for independence, given a perceived lack of commitment to democratic values on the part of the Belgrade authorities.<br />

This "advance" on the date of independence was a critical element of the Slovenian plan to gain an early advantage in the expected conflict. The Slovenian government fully expected the Yugoslav military to respond with force on the day of the declaration of independence or shortly afterwards. By secretly advancing the date by 24 hours, the Slovenians wrongfooted the Yugoslav government, which had set 26 June as the date for its move.<br />
<br />
Although the Yugoslav army was adamantly opposed to Slovenian independence, it was divided about what to do.

The move immediately led to a strong reaction from local Slovenians, who organized spontaneous barricades and demonstrations against the JNA's actions.

By this time, the Slovenian government had already put into action its plan to seize control of the republic's border posts and the international airport at Brnik. The personnel manning the border posts were, in most cases, already Slovenians, so the Slovenian take-over mostly simply amounted to changing of uniforms and insignia, without any fighting. This was undertaken, in the words of Janez Janša, to "establish our sovereignty in the key triangle, border-customs-air control." It also had important practical effects. The border crossings were a major source of revenue. In addition, by taking control of the borders, the Slovenians were able to establish defensive positions against an expected JNA attack.<br />

The Ten-Day War was formally ended with the Brioni Accord, signed on the Croatian Brioni Islands. Slovenian and Croatian independence were agreed to. The terms were distinctly favourable to Slovenia; it was agreed that Slovenia and Croatia would postpone their independence for three months — which in practical terms had little real impact — and the Slovenian police and armed forces (<a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("635",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("635")' href="/topics/Slovenian_Territorial_Defence">Slovenian Territorial Defence</a><span class="hp" id="m635"><div class="hpHeader">Slovenian Territorial Defence</div><div class="hpContent">The Territorial Defence of the Republic of Slovenia, also the Territorial Defence of Slovenia  was the predecessor of the Slovenian Armed Forces.- History :...</div><br></span>) were recognised as sovereign on their territory.<br />
<br />
It was agreed that all Yugoslav military units would leave Slovenia, with the Yugoslav government setting a deadline of the end of October to complete the process. The Slovenian government insisted that the withdrawal should proceed on its terms; the JNA was not allowed to take much of its heavy weaponry and equipment, which was later either deployed locally or sold to other Yugoslav republics. The withdrawal began about ten days later and was completed by 26 October.<br />
<H2>Casualties</H2>
Due to the short duration and low intensity of the war, casualties were not high. According to Slovenian estimates, the JNA suffered 44 fatalities and 146 wounded, while the Slovenians had 18 killed and 182 wounded. Twelve foreign nationals were killed in the conflict, principally journalists and <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("98121",this,"bulgaria.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("98121")' href="/topics/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a><span class="hp" id="m98121"><div class="hpHeader">Bulgaria</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i98121"></div>Bulgaria  , officially the Republic of Bulgaria , is a parliamentary democracy within a unitary constitutional republic in Southeast Europe.

According to post-war assessments made by the JNA, its material losses amounted to 31 tanks, 22 armoured personnel carriers, 6 helicopters, 6,787 infantry weapons, 87 artillery pieces and 124 air defence weapons damaged, destroyed or confiscated. Property damage was not heavy, due to the scattered and short-term nature of the fighting.<br />

Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the video segment. Slovene officials maintain that the JNA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("69037",this,"b92.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("69037")' href="/topics/B92">B92</a><span class="hp" id="m69037"><div class="hpHeader">B92</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i69037"></div>B92  is a radio and television broadcaster with national coverage headquartered in Belgrade, Serbia.

<H2>Strategic aspects of the war</H2>
The actions of Slovenia's forces were largely dictated by the military strategy devised some months before and were tightly integrated with an equally detailed media management plan. An international media centre was established prior to the outbreak of conflict with <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("93094",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("93094")' href="/topics/Jelko_Kacin">Jelko Kacin</a><span class="hp" id="m93094"><div class="hpHeader">Jelko Kacin</div><div class="hpContent">Jelko Kacin  is a Slovenian politician and Member of the European Parliament.

This won considerable international sympathy and favourable media coverage for the cause of independent Slovenia.<br />
<br />
The Slovenians had the advantage of superior morale, compared to their adversaries in the Yugoslav army. Many of the Yugoslav soldiers did not realise they were taking part in a real military operation, rather than an exercise, until they came under attack.

The Slovenian strategy relied on a number of risky gambles. Slovenia could not have resisted the JNA for long had the full weight of the federal army been brought into action, but its leaders had gambled on the JNA leadership's unwillingness to risk mass civilian casualties. In the diplomatic arena, the Slovenian government had gambled that the international community would step in to press the Yugoslavs to desist — in both  suppositions they were proven correct.<br />
<br />
The Slovenians were also well aware that the Serbian government of Slobodan Milošević was not particularly concerned about Slovenia's independence, given the lack of any significant Serbian minority in the country. On 30 June, Defence Minister General Kadijević suggested to the Yugoslav federal presidency a massive attack on Slovenia to break down the unexpectedly heavy resistance.

<H2>Consequences of the war</H2>
For Slovenia, the war marked the decisive defence of its independence in regard to Yugoslavia. It was officially recognised by all European Community member states on 15 January 1992 and joined the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("33669",this,"united_nations.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("33669")' href="/topics/United_Nations">United Nations</a><span class="hp" id="m33669"><div class="hpHeader">United Nations</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i33669"></div>The United Nations  is an international organization whose stated aims are facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achievement of world peace...</div><br></span>&nbsp;on 22 May.<br />

With Croatia as a buffer between Slovenia and Serbia, Slovenia was able to maintain its independence and position as the most stable and prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics and joined the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("83040",this,"european_union.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("83040")' href="/topics/European_Union">European Union</a><span class="hp" id="m83040"><div class="hpHeader">European Union</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i83040"></div>The European Union  is an economic and political union  of 27 independent member states which are located primarily in Europe.

The war led to a series of major shifts on the Yugoslav side. The JNA eventually lost nearly all of its Slovenian and Croat personnel, becoming an almost entirely Serbian and Montenegrin force. Its poor performance in Slovenia and later in Croatia discredited its leadership — Kadijević resigned as defence minister in January 1992, and Adžić was forced into medical retirement shortly afterwards.<br />

Slovenia used the period to consolidate its institutions, deliver some of the most urgent economic reforms and prepare for international recognition of the country.<br />
